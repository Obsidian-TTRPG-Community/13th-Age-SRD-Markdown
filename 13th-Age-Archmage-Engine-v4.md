### 1.0

Initial release.

# Icons

The *13^th^ Age* Archmage Engine supports the concept of *icons*. An
icon is a powerful NPC (non-playable character) that has a strong
influence on the world outside of your campaign, yet may indeed aid or
oppose your character over the course of your campaign, depending on the
relationship your character has with the icon.

Icons have their own story, alignment, and personality. The general
knowledge and history about them may vary in depth and accuracy; they
may be well-known or mysterious. They have their own relationships with
other icons, too, which may be friendly, tolerable, or acrimonious.

Your character may have relationships with certain icons. This
relationship, if it exists, can be positive, conflicted, or negative.
See Icon Relationships.

# Character Rules

These rules are for the character you create, your PC (playable
character).

## Race

Every character has a race (see Races). Pick one for your character. If
you want to make a non-standard race for your character, the rules won't
hinder you. The system is designed to be flexible enough to allow for
improvisation.

Each race provides a +2 bonus to one of your ability scores.

## Class

Every character has a class (see Classes). Pick one of these too.

Each class provides a +2 bonus to one of your ability scores.

## Abilities

Your character can be assigned ability scores in various ways. Here are
two ways.

### Roll 'em

Roll 4d6 for each of the six ability scores (Strength, Constitution,
Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma). Drop the low die in each
roll. Put the scores into any order to best fit the character you want
to play.

### Point Buy

You get 28 points to buy your abilities using the chart below.

## Combat Stats

For details on how combat works, see Combat Rules.

Although Armor Class, Physical Defense, and Mental Defense are based on
a single ability score, the score each defense uses depends on the
character. In each case, you look at three ability modifiers and use the
middle value (not the highest or the lowest). If two or more modifiers
are tied, you use one of those tied scores as the middle score.

### 1^st^ level Hit Points

1.  Find the base value for your class (6, 7, or 8) in the Starting
    Stats for 1^st^ Level Characters chart.

2.  Add your Con modifier to get your "hit point value."

3.  Multiply your hit point value by 3 to get your total hit points at
    1^st^ level.

### Armor Class

1.  Find the base AC value for your class (10 to 16) in the Starting
    Stats for 1^st^ Level Characters chart.

2.  Find the middle value among your Con modifier, Dex modifier, and Wis
    modifier. That value is your AC modifier.

3.  Add the AC modifier to your base AC value.

4.  Add +1 at 1^st^ level (and increase by +1 at each additional class
    level).

### Physical Defense

1.  Find the base PD for your class (10 to 12) in the Starting Stats for
    1^st^ Level Characters chart.

2.  Find the middle value among your Str modifier, Con modifier, and Dex
    modifier. That value is your PD modifier.

3.  Add the PD modifier to your base PD.

4.  Add +1 at 1^st^ level (and increase by +1 at each additional class
    level).

### Mental Defense

1.  Find the base MD for your class (10 to 12) in the Starting Stats for
    1^st^ Level Characters chart.

2.  Find the middle value among your Int modifier, Wis modifier, and Cha
    modifier. That value is your MD modifier.

3.  Add the MD modifier to your base MD.

4.  Add +1 at 1^st^ level (and increase by +1 for each class level).

### Initiative

Your Initiative bonus is a d20 check, not a static value.

1.  Start with your Dexterity modifier.

2.  Add +1 at 1^st^ level (and increase by +1 at each additional class
    level).

### Recoveries & Recovery Dice

Most characters start the game with 8 recoveries. (See Recoveries.) Some
classes and talent choices may give you more recoveries.

Each class also has a different recovery die, usually a d6, d8, or d10,
as specified in the class write-up. When you roll a recovery, you'll
roll a number of recovery dice equal to your level and add your
Constitution modifier.

### Attacks and Powers

You calculate attack and damage rolls based on the ability scores
favored by your class or by the specific powers you choose within your
class. Most classes use one specific ability score for most of their
attacks. See Classes for more information.

## One Unique Thing

Your character's One Unique Thing (their *unique*) is a special feature
invented by you, the player, which sets your character apart from every
other hero. It is a unique and special trait to your player, and
markedly unusual. The intent is that it provides a special flavor to the
campaign and can assist the GM in determining how your character can
interact with characters and story in the campaign.

Your character's *unique* should not provide general practical value in
combat. That is not the intent. The intent is to open up story arcs and
fun roleplaying opportunities.

## Icon Relationships

Your character's relationship with icons is an important way to draw him
or her into your game world. An icon may have its own champions and
heroes (including you) to advance its cause in the game world.

### Relationship Points

At 1^st^ level, each character gets 3 relationship points. Each point
represents one d6 to be used when trying to leverage your connection to
the icon. (See Using Icon Relationships.)

The number of points you invest in a relationship with an icon doesn't
necessarily correlate with the closeness of the connection or the
strength of the relationship. It does correlate with the utility of the
relationship. It's not necessarily about how well the icon knows you or
how strong the icon feels about you. Instead, the points reflect the
chance that your relationship will be helpful to you.

The Icons Relationships Master Chart summarizes the likely roleplaying
and story-oriented consequences of positive, conflicted, and negative
relationships with heroic, ambiguous, and villainous icons.

+-------+----------------------+--------------------+-----------------+

This chart assumes that you're playing a heroic character. A villainous
character will need to swap the maximums between heroic and villainous
icons.

### Rolling Icon Relationship Dice

To check your icon relationship (your relationship with a particular
icon), roll a d6 for each point you have in the relationship. This means
that you will usually roll 1, 2, or 3 dice. (At epic level, it may be
4.)

If any die is a 6, you get some meaningful advantage from the
relationship without having complications. If two or three dice come up
6, that's even better.

If any die is a 5, your connection to the icon is going to work out as
well as a 6 would, but with some unexpected complication. If it's a good
icon, you might be drawn into some obligation. If it's a villainous
icon, you might attract unwanted attention.

Rolling 5s when you also rolled 6s should make life both interesting and
advantageous!

### Icons' Organizations

Icons are usually not directly part of the campaign. They rarely make an
appearance personally, except perhaps at epic level. Most of the time,
interacting with an icon means that you're actually interacting with his
or her lower-level functionaries, acolytes, disciples, bureaucrats,
lieutenants, barons, priests, etc. In fact, any level of relationship
with an icon can be enough to get you noticed by other people who are
connected to that icon.

### Using Icon Relationships

The most straightforward way to use your relationship points is on
positive or conflicted connections that generally provide you with
outright assistance and useful information.

Negative relationships usually provide inside knowledge, special skills,
opportunistic allies, and possibly some sort of supernatural advantage
against a villain.

Often you might find that enemies of your rival see you as an
opportunity to strike against that mutual enemy. You might get help,
wealth and resources, and even magic items from quite unexpected
sources, some of which may not be entirely to your liking.

In addition to aid from others, icon relationships provide characters
with special knowledge.

A negative relationship with a thoroughly villainous icon is more in
keeping with the heroic lifestyle, but you should expect that the
assistance you get from a negative relationship may end up being more
directly confrontational than more conventional conflicted and positive
relationships.

### Changing Relationships

When your character achieves champion level (5^th^), you gain an extra
relationship point. Use it to increase an existing relationship by one
die or gain a 1-point relationship with a new icon to match your
character's story thus far. You can save the extra relationship die and
decide to apply it later.

At 5^th^ level, or any time thereafter, you can switch an existing
relationship point from one icon to another, including to a new icon.
You owe the GM and other players an entertaining explanation of what
this big change represents for your character personally, of course.

When you reach epic level (8^th^), you gain another relationship point,
which you can use to increase an existing icon relationship by one die,
including up to 1 point over maximum. As at 5^th^ level, if switching a
relationship point from one icon to another makes sense for your 8^th^
level character, go for it.

## Backgrounds & Skill Checks

Backgrounds represent pieces of your character's history that
contributes to your character's history as well as their ability to
succeed with non-combat skills.

Each character has a number of points to allocate to a set of
backgrounds. These are broad categories of experience (cat burglar, for
example) rather than specific implementations of that experience
(climbing and hiding).

Backgrounds don't sync to a specific ability score, though some
backgrounds obviously may get used more often with certain ability
scores than others.

### Assigning Background Points

Each character gets 8 background points, plus any extra that your
class's talents award. Assign your background points to as many
backgrounds as you want, up to your total points. You can assign a
maximum of 5 points to a single background (and minimum of 1).

### Making Skill Checks

When you roll a skill check to find out if you succeed at a task or
trick, the GM tells you which ability score is being tested. Then you
choose the background you think is relevant to gain the points you have
in that background as a bonus to the skill check.

Most skill checks require you to equal or beat a Difficulty Class (DC),
set by the environment you are operating in, to succeed.

To make a skill check, use this formula:

> D20 + relevant ability modifier + level + relevant background points
>
> Vs.
>
> DC set by the environment

You can't apply multiple backgrounds to the same check; the background
with the highest (or tied for highest) bonus applies.

### Choosing Your Backgrounds

Choose backgrounds that help you make sense of your characters past,
jobs, and settings. Background and skill use is meant to be about fun
in-character methods of attempting to advance the plot.

A few possible backgrounds include: acrobat, alchemist, animal trainer,
architect, aristocratic noble, assassin, chef, con-woman, goblin
exterminator, hunted outlaw, knight errant, magecraft, priest, refugee,
scout, shepherd, soldier, spy, temple acolyte, thief, torturer,
transformed animal, traveling martial arts pupil, tribal healer, tunnel
scout, wandering minstrel, warrior poet, and so on.

#### Choose the Relevant Ability Score

For players, the point of this background/skill system is to encourage
roleplaying and creative solutions to problems. Not every problem can be
solved by your dominant abilities. For the GM, it's the chance to make
all of the ability scores matter at one time or another.

### Natural 20s and Fumbles with Skill Checks

When a PC rolls a natural 20 with a skill check, the GM should feel free
to give that character much more success than the player expected.

When a PC rolls a 1 with a skill check, the skill check fumbles and
fails, perhaps in a particularly bad way. But a failure isn't always
entirely terrible....

#### Fail Forward!

Outside of battle, when failure would tend to slow action down rather
than move the action along, instead interpret it as a near-success or
event that happens to carry unwanted consequences or side effects. The
character probably still fails to achieve the desired goal, but that's
because something happens on the way to the goal rather than because
nothing happens. In any case, the story and action still keep moving.

### Background/Skill Advancement

All your skill checks increase by 1 when you level up. If you want even
better skill checks, take the Further Backgrounding feat.

If you just want to move around the bonuses you already have to show how
your character is changing, you can move one background point around
among your current backgrounds each time you gain a level, or swap the
point into an entirely new background, with the GM's permission.

## Feats

Characters choose a feat at 1^st^ level, and at every subsequent level.

Feats appear in three tiers: adventurer feats, champion feats, and epic
feats. Adventurer feats are available to any character between level 1
and level 10. Champion feats are available starting at level 5. Epic
feats are available starting at level 8.

### Feats per Level

+-------------------+--------------------------------------------------+

Since humans start with an additional feat at 1^st^ level, add one to
the number of adventurer feats humans possess all the way up the chart.

Most of the feats in the game are attached to specific class talents,
attacks, and spells. If a feat is attached to a talent, power, or spell,
you must have the talent, power, or spell in order to choose the feat.
When there is more than one feat attached to a specific talent or power,
you have to choose the lower tier feats before you pick up the higher
tier feats.

### General Feats

These are general feats available to any character. A character can't
take a specific feat more than once. A few general feats only have
adventurer-tier versions; others also have champion- and epic-tier
versions that can be added later in your career.

#### Further Backgrounding

##### Adventurer Tier

Add a total of 2 points to backgrounds you already have, or choose 2
points of new backgrounds that make sense for your character. You still
can't go over the 5-point-per-background maximum.

##### Champion Tier

Add a total of 3 points to backgrounds you already have, or choose 3
points of new backgrounds that make sense for your character. You still
can't go over the 5-point-per-background maximum.

##### Epic Tier

Add a total of 2 points to backgrounds you already have, or choose 2
points of new backgrounds that make sense for your character. These
points can take one of your backgrounds over 5, to a maximum of 7.

#### Improved Initiative

Adventurer Tier: Gain a +4 bonus to Initiative checks.

#### Linguist

Adventurer Tier: This feat allows you to speak enough arcana, dwarven,
elven, gnomish, gnoll, goblin, orcish, and other standard humanoid
languages to comprehend enough of what most other humanoids are saying
or screaming during battle. You are not fluent in all these languages,
no one will mistake you for a native speaker, and your vocabulary is
adventurer-centric (heavy on words connected to danger rather than
philosophy or emotions).

You can also read enough to get by in all these languages.

##### Champion Tier

You can speak, read, and write all the humanoid languages fluently.
Stranger languages are no problem for you either. If someone is speaking
it, you can figure it out.

#### Precise Shot

Adventurer Tier: When your ranged attack targets an enemy who is engaged
with an ally, you have no chance of hitting that ally.

#### Rapid Reload

Adventurer Tier: Reloading a heavy crossbow now takes only a quick
action. Reloading a hand or light crossbow is a free action.

#### Reach Tricks

Once per battle, tell the GM how you are using your weapon's reach to
perform an unexpected stunt with a reach weapon such as a longspear or
halberd. To use the stunt, you must roll a 6+ on a d20.

#### Ritual Casting

Adventurer Tier: You can cast any spells you know as rituals. Classes
that are already ritual casters (cleric, wizard) don't need this feat.
(See Rituals for ritual casting rules.)

#### Skill Escalation

Adventurer Tier: Twice per day, you can add the escalation die to one of
your skill checks. Choose after you roll the check.

#### Strong Recovery

Adventurer Tier: When you roll recovery dice, reroll one of the dice and
use the higher result. At 5^th^ level, reroll two of the dice. At 8^th^
level, reroll three.

#### Toughness

Adventurer Tier: You get additional hit points equal to half your
baseline class hit points (rounded down). At 5^th^ level, the total hp
bonus increases to your baseline hp value. At 8^th^ level, the total hp
bonus increases to double your baseline hp value.

## Gear

Every character has a set of gear. Each class lists the type of gear a
member of that class normally uses. You can equip non-magical gear as
your backgrounds and character history suggest.

# Races

The major races included in the *13^th^ Age* Archmage Engine include
humans, dwarves, elves, gnomes, half-elves, half-orcs, and halflings.
Your character need not be limited to these races, however. Minor races,
including Dragonic/Dragonspawn, Holy One/Aasimar,
Forgeborn/Dwarf-forged, and Tiefling/Demontouched, are also referenced
below.

Each race is associated with two ability scores, one of which can be
chosen for your character's racial bonus.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The character also receives a separate class bonus. These two bonuses
must apply to different ability scores.

Each race also provides the character a special power that can be used
once per battle. (It is regained after a quick rest.) This is called the
*racial power*.

## Human

### Racial Bonus

+2 to any ability score.

#### Bonus Feat

At 1^st^ level, human PCs start with two feats instead of one.

### Racial Power

#### Quick to Fight

At the start of each battle, roll initiative twice and choose the result
you want.

#### Champion Feat

If you roll a natural 19 or 20 for initiative, increase the escalation
die by 1 (usually from 0 to 1 since it's the start of the battle).

## Dwarf

### Racial Bonus

+2 Con or +2 Wis

### Racial Power

#### That's Your Best Shot?

Once per battle as a free action after you have been hit by an enemy
attack, you can heal using a recovery. If the escalation die is less
than 2, you only get half the usual healing from the recovery. Unlike
other recoveries that might allow you to take an average result, you
have to roll this one!

Note that you can't use this ability if the attack drops you to 0 hp or
below. You've got to be on your feet to sneer at their attack and
recover.

##### Champion Feat

If the escalation die is 2+ when you use that's your best shot, the
recovery is free.

## Dark Elf

### Racial Bonus

+2 Dex or +2 Cha

### Adventurer Feat (Elf)

#### Heritage of the Sword

If you can already use swords that deal d6 and d8 damage without attack
penalties, you gain a +2 damage bonus with them. (This bonus doesn't
increase miss damage.)

Otherwise, if your class would ordinarily have an attack penalty with
such swords, you can now use them without penalties.

### Racial Power

#### Cruel

Once per battle, deal ongoing damage to a target you hit with a natural
even attack roll as a free action. The ongoing damage equals 5 times
your level. (For example, at 3^rd^ level you would deal 15 ongoing
damage against a single target.) As usual, a normal save (11+) ends the
damage. A critical hit doesn't double this ongoing damage.

##### Champion Feat

Once per day, you can instead use *cruel* to deal 5 ongoing damage per
level against an enemy you miss or that you roll a natural odd attack
against.

## High Elf

### Racial Bonus

+2 Int or +2 Cha

### Racial Power

#### Highblood Teleport

Once per battle as a move action, place yourself in a nearby location
you can see.

##### Champion Feat

Deal damage equal to twice your level to one enemy engaged with you
before or after you teleport.

## Wood Elf

### Racial Bonus

+2 Dex or +2 Wis

### Racial Power

#### Elven Grace

At the start of each of your turns, roll a die to see if you get an
extra standard action. If your roll is equal to or lower than the
escalation die, you get an extra standard action that turn.

At the start of battle, you roll a d6. Each time you successfully gain
an extra action, the size of the die you roll increases by one step on
the following progression: (d4), d6, d8, d10, d12, d20. If you get an
extra action after rolling a d20, you can't get any more extra actions
that battle.

##### Champion Feat

Once per day, start a battle rolling a d4 for elven grace instead of a
d6.

## Gnome

### Racial Bonus

+2 Dex or +2 Int

#### Small

Gnomes have a +2 AC bonus against opportunity attacks.

### Racial Power

#### Confounding (Racial Power)

Once per battle, when you roll a natural 16+ with an attack, you can
also daze the target until the end of your next turn.

##### Champion Feat

Instead of being dazed, the target of your *confounding* ability is
weakened until the end of your next turn.

#### Minor Illusions

As a standard action, at-will, you can create a strong smell or a sound
nearby. Nearby creatures that fail a normal save notice the smell or
sound. Creatures that make the save may notice it but recognize it as
not exactly real.

## Half-elf

### Racial Bonus

+2 Con or +2 Cha

### Racial Power

#### Surprising

Once per battle, subtract one from the natural result of one of your own
d20 rolls.

##### Champion Feat

You gain an additional use of *surprising* each battle, but you can only
use it to affect a nearby ally's d20 roll.

## Halfling

### Racial Bonus

+2 Con or +2 Dex

#### Small

Halflings have a +2 AC bonus against opportunity attacks.

### Racial Power

#### Evasive

Once per battle, force an enemy that hits you with an attack to reroll
the attack with a --2 penalty.

##### Champion Feat

The enemy's reroll takes a --5 penalty instead.

## Half-orc

### Racial Bonus

+2 Str or +2 Dex

### Racial Power

#### Lethal

Once per battle, reroll a melee attack and use the roll you prefer as
the result.

##### Champion Feat

If the *lethal* attack reroll is a natural 16+, you can use *lethal*
again later this battle.

## Dragonic/Dragonspawn

### Racial Bonus

+2 Str or +2 Cha

### Racial Power

#### Breath Weapon

Once per battle, make a close-quarters *breath weapon* attack as a quick
action using your highest ability score against one nearby enemy's
Physical Defense. On a hit, the attack deals 1d6 damage per your level
of an energy type that makes sense for your character.

##### Champion Feat

Your breath weapon attack targets 1d3 nearby enemies in a group instead.

## Holy One/Aasimar

### Racial Bonus

+2 Wis or +2 Cha

### Racial Power

#### Halo

Once per battle as a free action during your turn, gain a +2 bonus to
all defenses until you are hit by an attack (or until the battle ends).

##### Champion Feat

*Halo* also activates automatically any time you heal using a recovery.

## Forgeborn/Dwarf-forged

### Racial Bonus

+2 Str or +2 Con

### Racial Power

#### Never Say Die

Whenever you drop to 0 hp or below, roll a normal save if you have a
recovery available. On an 11+, instead of falling unconscious, you stay
on your feet and can heal using a recovery. Add the recovery hit points
to 0 hp to determine your hp total.

##### Champion Feat

If you roll a 16+ on your *never-say-die* save, you gain an additional
standard action during your next turn.

## Tiefling/Demontouched

### Racial Bonus

+2 Str or +2 Int

### Racial Power

#### Curse of Chaos

Once per battle as a free action when a nearby enemy rolls a natural
1--5 on an attack or a save, turn their roll into a natural 1 and
improvise a further curse that shows how their attempt backfires
horribly.

A curse should have about the same impact as a typical once-per-battle
ability. For example, a typical curse might lead to the cursed attacker
dealing half damage to themself with their fumbled attack and being
dazed until the end of their next turn. The GM may reward storytelling
flair and/or limit the suggested effects of the curse.

##### Champion Feat

Whenever a nearby enemy rolls a natural 1 on an attack against you, you
can use *curse of chaos* against them without expending it.

# Classes

## Class Basics

### Weapon Damage Progression

The basic rule for PC weapon damage is that a character deals 1 die of
weapon damage per class level, plus their ability modifier (or double
the modifier at 5^th^ level, and triple it at 8^th^ level). See Weapons
for more on weapon damage rules.

### Spell Progression

Most of the spells used by characters have higher-level versions. Those
versions allow you to choose the spell as a higher-level option if you
like, rather than choosing an all-new spell. You do not automatically
gain access to the higher-level effects of a spell when you level up
just because you have a lower-level version of it.

Higher-level spells have higher damage amounts than their lower-level
counterparts, but these amounts and effects are not cumulative. Amounts
from the highest level spell you have are used. New effects from higher
level spells are added to the spell's original effects.

### Shifting Choices during an Adventure

These are guidelines for allowing PCs to change their chosen spells,
powers, talents, and feats during gameplay, subject to how forgiving you
and your fellow players are.

#### Talents

Talents are a core element of your character. If you're going to
rearrange your talents, something extremely significant needs to have
happened in your character's story, some personal transformation or
revelation. It is a sign of character transformation, usually coinciding
with shifts in icon relationships.

#### Spells

You can change the spells you can cast after each full heal-up.

#### Powers

You can reselect your power choices when you gain a level.

#### Feats

If you've made changes to spells and powers, revise your feats
appropriately. If the changes make sense for the character's story and
the GM agrees, play them.

#### Incremental Advances

You can gain a higher-level power or spell from an incremental advance.
If you opt to raise an existing spell to a higher level, you can replace
its lower-level spot with a new lower-level spell. If you swap out
lower-level spell for a higher-level spell, you can't replace a spell or
power you have already expended.

### Class Feature

All barbarians have the Barbarian Rage class feature.

#### Barbarian Rage

Once per day, use a quick action to start raging. A rage lasts until the
end of battle, or about 5 minutes.

While raging, you roll 2d20 to hit with your barbarian melee and thrown
weapon attacks instead of 1d20. Use the higher roll for the attack. If
you roll a natural 11+ with both dice and your highest attack roll is a
hit, the attack is a critical hit!

*Recharge 16+:* After a battle in which you rage, roll a d20 and add
your Constitution modifier. On a 16+, you can use Barbarian Rage again
later in the day.

##### Adventurer Feat

Whenever the escalation die is 4+, as a quick action, you can start
raging for free. (It doesn't count against your normal usage.) This rage
lasts until the end of the battle, as normal.

##### Champion Feat

You can now start raging freely when the escalation die is 3+.

##### Epic Feat

You can now start raging freely when the escalation die is 2+.

### Adventurer Talents

Choose three of the following adventurer-tier class talents. You also
get an additional barbarian class talent at 5^th^ level and again at
8^th^ level.

#### Barbaric Cleave

Once per battle, as a free action, you can make a standard melee attack
after having dropped any enemy to 0 hp with a standard melee attack.
Mooks do not count for this, unless the mook you dropped was the last of
its mook mob.

##### Adventurer Feat

You gain a +2 attack bonus with Barbaric Cleave attacks. If the cleave
attack hits, you can heal using a recovery.

##### Champion Feat

If there is no foe engaged with you to use your Barbaric Cleave attack
against, as a free action you can move to a nearby foe before making the
attack.

##### Epic Feat

While raging, you can use Barbaric Cleave as many times as you like
during a battle, but only once per round.

#### Building Frenzy

One battle per day, as a free action after you have missed an attack,
gain +1d4 damage to each successful melee attack until the end of the
battle. For each missed attack following this, add another +1d4 damage,
up to a maximum of +4d4 damage.

##### Adventurer Feat

Bonus damage dice are now d6s.

##### Champion Feat

Bonus damage dice are now d10s.

##### Epic Feat

You can use Building Frenzy twice a day.

#### Slayer

During your turn, when you attack a staggered enemy you were not engaged
with at the start of your turn, deal +1d6 damage per level to that
creature if you hit.

##### Adventurer Feat

You gain a +2 bonus to Slayer attacks.

##### Champion Feat

Once per battle, when you miss with a Slayer attack, deal the additional
+1d6-per-level damage to the target instead of normal miss damage.

##### Epic Feat

Whenever one of your Slayer attacks drops a non-mook enemy to 0 hp, you
gain 20 temporary hit points.

#### Strongheart

Your recovery dice are d12s instead of d10s.

##### Adventurer Feat

Increase your total number of recoveries by 1.

##### Champion Feat

You gain +1 PD. When you heal using a recovery, you can roll a save
against a save ends effect.

##### Epic Feat

Increase your total number of recoveries by 1 (making a total of +2 from
this talent).

#### Unstoppable

Once per battle, declare you're using Unstoppable before making a
barbarian melee attack. If your attack hits at least one target, you can
heal using a recovery.

##### Adventurer Feat

The Unstoppable recovery is free.

##### Champion Feat

Add double your Constitution modifier to the healing the recovery
provides.

##### Epic Feat

You can use Unstoppable twice per battle.

#### Whirlwind

You can make a Whirlwind attack as the first action of your turn when
you are engaged by two or more enemies.

You take a --4 penalty to your AC and PD until the start of your next
turn. Then roll a separate melee attack against each enemy you are
engaged with. You deal no miss damage with these attacks.

##### Adventurer Feat

You now deal normal miss damage with missed Whirlwind attacks.

##### Champion Feat

The penalty to your AC and PD is reduced to --2. In addition, disengage
checks you make the same turn as using Whirlwind automatically succeed.

##### Epic Feat

You can use Whirlwind anytime during your turn, not just as the first
action.

### Champion Talents

At 5^th^ level, you gain an additional barbarian class talent. Choose
one of these champion-tier talents or take another adventurer-tier
talent.

#### Natural Will

One battle per day as a quick action, you gain a +2 bonus to your Mental
Defense until the end of the battle.

##### Adventurer Feat

You can now use Natural Will in two battles per day.

##### Champion Feat

The bonus increases to +4 Mental Defense.

##### Epic Feat

You can now use Natural Will as a free action when an enemy attacks you.

#### Violence

Once per battle, add a +1d4 bonus to a barbarian melee attack roll after
finding out whether you hit or missed.

##### Champion Feat

If the attack still misses, deal half damage.

##### Epic Feat

The bonus increases to +1d6.

### Epic Talents

At 8^th^ level, you gain an additional barbarian class talent. Choose
one of these epic-tier talents, or take another adventurer-tier or
champion-tier talent instead.

#### Ancestral Warband

One battle per day as a quick action, you can call the spirits of your
ancestors to fight alongside you. Your ancestors can't be hurt or
affected by the creatures of this world.

At the end of each of your turns, if you are conscious, roll a d6. If
you roll less than or equal to the escalation die, a member of your
spirit warband strikes from the spirit realm into the world. Make a
melee attack against a nearby enemy as if you were making the attack
yourself, using any talents, feats, or magic items as you see fit. This
attack doesn't take any of your actions.

##### Epic Feat

Your Ancestral Warband spirits are always raging, even if you are not,
and continue to fight for a single round while you are unconscious.

#### Relentless

While raging, you have resist damage 12+ (when an attack targets you,
the attacker must roll a natural 12 or higher on the attack roll or it
only deals half damage).

##### Epic Feat

Even when not raging, whenever you score a critical hit against an
enemy, you have resist damage 12+ until the start of your next turn.

## Bard

### Ability Scores

Bards gain a +2 class bonus to Dexterity or Charisma, as long as it
isn't the same ability you increase with your +2 racial bonus.

### Backgrounds

Possible backgrounds include: wandering minstrel, cathedral musician,
court jester, mercenary, tavern owner, failed hedge wizard, diplomat,
spy, royal taster, caravan guide, smuggler, and battle skald.

### Gear

At 1^st^ level, bards start with non-magical musical instruments, a
melee and ranged weapon of their choice, some form of light armor, and
any other minor elements of gear their backgrounds suggest.

#### Gold Pieces

Bards may start with either 25 gp or 1d6 x 10 gp.

### Class Features

As a bard advances in level, they have three different types of powers
to choose in combat: bardic songs, battle cries, and spells.

#### Bardic Songs

Bardic songs last for one or more rounds and end with a final verse that
carries a big payoff. Although magical, bardic songs don't count as
spells; they don't force the bard to suffer opportunity attacks from
engaged enemies, and they can't be canceled by effects that can cancel
spells. In fact, bards can cast spells while in the middle of singing a
bardic song.

Each song specifies what type of action starts it. To sustain it during
the next round, it requires an action and a d20 check against its
sustain target. If successful, the song can continue with its sustained
effect for that round. (The next round will require another sustain
check.) If your attempt to sustain a song fails, the song's final verse
effect resolves immediately, and then the song's power ends. You can
start another song on your next round.

You don't have to try to sustain the song at the start of your turn. If
you choose not to sustain a song, its effects end immediately and you
choose whether to use the song's final verse effect in the current round
or to start a new song. You can't do both.

Some songs have an immediate effect that happens each time you start or
sustain the song. Others have effects that continue throughout the
entire round.

Most songs stop when a bard is knocked unconscious, silenced, or
stunned. Having your song stopped this way prevents you from getting the
final verse effect.

You can only sing one bardic song at a time. If you are singing a song
(or spend an action to try to sustain a song), you can't start another
song that round.

Bardic songs are loud, and cancel any of stealth effects you may have.

##### Adventurer Feat

Your bardic songs don't stop immediately when you are knocked
unconscious, stunned, or silenced. Instead, they continue for one round,
giving you the chance to sustain the song on your next turn.

#### Battle Cries

Bards use battle cries to encourage, inspire, warn, and magically aid
their allies. Battle cries are triggered by flexible melee attacks. The
bard makes a melee attack and is able to use a battle cry that
corresponds to the attack's natural result, sometimes whether or not the
attack hits.

Bonuses provided by battle cries can help a bard's allies but not the
bard.

##### Adventurer Feat

You can generate the effect of any 1^st^ or 3^rd^ level battle cry you
know as a standard action (instead of making a flexible melee attack to
see which battle cry you are able to trigger). This allows you to choose
the particular battle cry you want, at the expense of taking your
standard action.

#### Spells

Bards use arcane spells that function like those of other spell-casting
classes. Some spells are daily, some recharge, and others are at-will.

Unlike most character classes, bards use two different ability scores
for their attacks. Their melee and ranged weapon attacks use Strength or
Dexterity, while their spells use Charisma.

### Class Talents

Choose three of the following class talents.

#### Balladeer

At each level, including 1^st^ level, you may learn a great ballad of
your choice. Each day you can sing one of these songs to give you a
positive relationship with an icon that you would not ordinarily
have...as well as increasing a negative relationship with another icon.

Song choices for the great ballad are up to the role-player.

It takes at least a few rounds to sing a great ballad, so ideally it
happens outside of combat. As you sing the ballad, it's an opportunity
to tell the GM what's special about the story you are telling.

Make a Charisma skill check using your best singing or musical
background. If you succeed, you gain 2 points of positive relationship
with the chosen icon for the rest of the day (until the next full
heal-up). The DC depends on the environment:

**DC 15:** Adventurer environment

**DC 20:** Champion environment

**DC 25:** Epic environment

You can use these points to roll relationship dice the way you roll your
normal icon relationships (see Icon Relationships). If you already have
positive or conflicted dice with the icon you've sung about, add them to
your new bonus dice. If you have negative dice with the icon you've sung
a ballad to, they can be temporarily overruled by the ballad, but the GM
should feel free to interpret any 5s rolled with a heavy hand.

When your great ballad magically compliments an icon, another icon
should take a hit. As you explain the story of your ballad to the GM,
you should account for at least one icon who is being mocked, vilified,
or referred to in unflattering terms. You get an equal number of cursed
dice for that icon. Cursed dice aren't like negative relationship
dice---they never help you. At the GM's option, you'll have to roll
these cursed dice at least once and interpret them as possible problems
for you: rolls of 1 are a definite problem; rolls of 2 mean there are
story complications connected to the temporary enemy icon.

##### Adventurer Feat

The first time you use your ballad-created relationship, any 5s you roll
become 6s. You also gain a +2 bonus to your Balladeer checks.

##### Champion Feat

### Class Features

Chaos mages use arcane implements, such as wands and staffs, to improve
their attacks. Unlike wizards and clerics, chaos mages don't choose the
spells they know. Instead, a chaos mage of a given level can access all
the spells in a category that are their level or lower.

The category of spell you'll cast on your turn is randomly decided, but
you get to decide how many of your resources you'll use. You have a
limited number of daily and once-per-battle spells, so each turn you
must decide whether to use one of the powerful spells in the category
you're casting from or whether you'll stick with an at-will spell.

Chaos mages are not allowed to cast rituals.

#### Chaos Magic

Chaos magic has three main categories of spells: attack, defense, and
iconic.

Since the category of magic spells you'll cast is randomly chosen,
you'll need 6 "stones" (gems, beads, poker chips, or whatever you like)
of three different colors---two stones for each color. You'll also need
a bag (or cup) to put them in and draw them from. Put two of each color
into the bag, then assign one color to attack, one color to defense, and
the last color to iconic.

If you'd rather use dice instead of stones in a bag, use a d6; 1-2 is
attack, 3-4 is defense, 5-6 is iconic.

You draw a stone from the bag to determine the next type of spell you'll
be able to cast. You usually do this when you roll initiative at the
start of a battle, at the end of your turn (to set up the spell you can
cast during your next turn), or as required during your turn if you
somehow get an extra standard action.

Each stone you draw should be set aside so that each turn you draw from
a smaller pool of stones. When there is one stone left in the bag, don't
draw it. Instead, refill the bag with the other six stones and draw. At
the end of the battle, refill the bag.

If you draw...

-   Attack: The next chaos mage spell you cast during the battle must be
    an attack spell, but you won't have to choose the spell until your
    turn.

-   Defense: The next chaos mage spell you cast during the battle must
    be a defense spell, but you won't have to choose the spell until
    your turn.

-   Iconic: The next chaos mage spell you cast during the battle must be
    an iconic spell. Immediately roll a die to determine which icon's
    spells you'll have to choose from. For example, if there are 12
    icons in your game, assign a number to each icon and roll a d12. You
    don't have to choose the specific spell until your turn.

Whether you cast an at-will, per-battle, or daily spell, you cast it at
the spell level shown on the spell progression table.

##### Adventurer Feat

Once per day when you cast an iconic daily or once-per-battle spell from
an icon you have at least a one-point relationship with, roll a normal
save. If you succeed, you don't expend that spell, allowing you to cast
it again, or another daily/once-per-battle spell.

##### Champion Feat

Once per day when you draw an iconic spell, before rolling, choose an
icon you have at least a one-point relationship with. The spell you cast
next will be from that icon.

##### Epic Feat 

You can use the champion feat power a second time, but only if you
choose an icon that you have at least a two-point relationship with.

#### High Weirdness

Chaos mages usually display an uncanny weirdness that presents itself
through their spellcasting, and sometimes even bleeds through to their
general demeanor. This weirdness is represented in game mechanics
through the High Weirdness table below.

When an enemy scores a critical hit against you, roll high weirdness and
consult the table to see what effect applies. If you hate the effect
you're experiencing, you can use a standard action to change it. Unless
otherwise specified, the high weirdness effects last until the end of
the battle.

Unless otherwise specified, the high weirdness effects last until the
end of the battle.

##### Adventurer Feat

If you have one or more Warp talents, whenever you make a d6 roll for
one, also roll for a new high weirdness effect. The new effect replaces
the weirdness effect currently active, if any.

If you have no Warp talents, roll for a new high weirdness effect
whenever you draw an iconic spell.

##### Champion Feat

Once per battle when you roll for a high weirdness effect, roll twice
and use both results. Reroll duplicate results.

##### Epic Feat

One battle per day, each time you roll for a high weirdness effect, roll
twice and use both results. Reroll duplicate results.

##### High Weirdness Table

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  d100     High Weirdness Effect
  -------- -----------------------------------------------------------------
  1--2     You accidentally summon 1d3 wibbles that either attack you or
           drift off to wreak a small amount of havoc elsewhere in the
           battle.

  3--4     You're hit by a pulsing wrinkle in time. You move and speak
           ever--so--slightly slower than you should until you catch up.
           There's no effect this turn, but at the end of your turn,
           decrease your initiative 2d6 points, to a minimum of 1.

  5--6     Each creature in the battle with temporary hit points loses half
           of them.

  7--8     You can only speak by asking questions. If you or your character
           violates this requirement, your character takes 1 damage the
           first time, 2 damage the second time, and so on. (Have another
           player keep track.)

  9--10    Your magic items' quirks take over. If you aren't doing a good
           enough job of roleplaying this personality fiasco, the GM and the
           rest of the players are authorized to suggest (in)appropriate
           behavior.

  11       You leech personality traits from surrounding spirits, whatever
           those happen to be. These are only traits, not personality
           overrides.

  12       You must speak in what you think could be the voice of the last
           creature your chaos mage attacked. If it doesn't seem to have a
           voice, invent one.

  13       Small squeaking rodents erupt from any plausible cover that you
           go near. There's no real effect except they're somewhat noisy and
           rodents suddenly pop up in unexpected places.

  14       Your (the PC) favorite song begins playing around you magically,
           getting louder and louder (tell the table what type of song it
           is, or maybe hum it). It might or might not interfere with bardic
           songs or monsters that need to be heard properly to get their
           dirty work done.

  15       A disembodied voice begins narrating the events of the battle to
           all participants. The voice isn\'t necessarily on your side, pick
           a random icon it seems to be associated with.

  16       You grow horns or other spikes all over. If you already have
           horns, then you lose them. Some of the horns, or lack thereof,
           persist after the weirdness ends.

  17       One of your arms becomes a functional tentacle. It has no
           mechanical effects, but unless you're special or lucky it's
           probably not a very pretty tentacle. Your option on whether or
           not it remains after the weirdness ends.

  18       A great gust of wind circles around the battlefield. It probably
           has no serious effect unless there's something happening that a
           great gust of wind could seriously affect.

  19       All creatures leave colored trails behind them as they move,
           turning the battle scene into a strange glowing artwork. Images
           fade every ten seconds or so.

  20       Some minor detail of your appearance changes hair color, gaps
           between teeth, handedness, and so on. The change is
           permanent--ish.

  21--22   Grit, explosive dust, or other debris explodes into the air
           around you, dealing 1d4 damage per tier to each nearby creature.

  23--24   There's tension in the air, or the rumble of distant thunder, or
           a sense of impending disaster, and the next creature that misses
           with an attack this battle takes damage equal your Charisma
           modifier (double your Charisma modifier at 5^th^ level; triple it
           at 8^th^ level).

  25--26   Quickly passing auras blur and shake across the battlefield, or
           cold winds whip through and grow warmer as they pass, or the
           lights flicker . . . and the creature that has taken the most
           damage in the battle gains temporary hit points equal to 10% of
           its maximum hit points.

  27--28   One random creature in the battle other than you teleports next
           to and is engaged by one of its random enemies other than you.

  29--30   (Global effect) Space seriously twists, affecting the spells and
           ranged attacks of each creature in the battle creatures that are
           nearby count as if they were faraway, and creatures that are
           faraway count as if they are nearby.

  31--32   The first spell you cast this battle has effects (not damage)
           like a spell two levels higher than it, if possible.

  33--34   (Global effect) All normal saves made by creatures in the battle
           are actually easy saves (6+).

  35--36   (Global effect) There's a blurring at the edge of all things. No
           creature can intercept another. Disengage attempts automatically
           succeed.

  37--38   (Global effect) The champions shall inherit the dirt! Until the
           end of your next turn, saves that fail count as if they succeed,
           and saves that succeed count as if they fail!

  39--40   Roll the escalation die and use the new result.

  41--42   (Global effect) Each creature in the battle taking ongoing damage
           immediately takes that damage. Then all ongoing damage effects
           end.

  43--44   (Global effect) Each creature that makes an attack targeting PD
           targets MD instead. Attacks against MD target PD instead.

  45--46   Your shadow detaches and flits around you. Until the weirdness
           ends, you gain a +2 attack bonus but take a --2 penalty to saves.
           Your personality may or may not be affected. It's up to you.

  47--48   Choose yourself or one ally with temporary hit points and double
           those temporary hit points.

  49--50   There's a large magical special effect of your choice
           (non-mechanical), and each creature in the battle ignores all
           resistances.

  51--55   You gain an additional quick action during each of your turns
           while this weirdness is in effect.

  56--60   When one of your allies casts an arcane spell this battle, the
           spell gains a small bonus effect chosen by the GM (something that
           suits the spell and the story).

  61--65   You and your allies gain small halos, or celestial light pours
           in, or a subtle glow illuminates each countenance. When one of
           your allies casts a divine spell this battle, it gains a small
           bonus effect chosen by the GM, something that suits the spell and
           the story.

  66--70   Your features shift and settle into a temporary new pattern. You
           gain a random racial ability until the end of your next turn.
           Ignore results that duplicate a racial ability you already have.
           Roll a d8. 1: dwarf's that's your best shot; 2: dark elf's cruel;
           3: high elf's highblood teleport; 4: gnome's confounding; 5:
           half--elf's surprising; 6: halfling's evasive; 7: holy one's
           halo; 8: tieflings's curse of chaos.

  71--75   If one of your allies is at 0 hit points or below, that ally can
           roll a free death save that won't count against their missed
           death save total.

  76--80   Choose one creature (including you) that has already rallied this
           battle. It can rally again this battle (using the same action it
           normally would) as if it hadn't already rallied (no roll if the
           first use).

  81--85   Your presence blurs through space, spirit, and time, and you can
           fight in spirit on your turn (see Combat Rules, Special Action)
           in addition to taking your normal turn.

  86--90   You shift, you waver, or you go transparent. You don't take any
           miss damage while this weirdness is affecting you.

  91--95   The magic items in the area all start talking at once. You or one
           ally of your choice can roll to recharge one magic item (affected
           creature's choice).

  96--97   Something related to your one unique thing goes very right for
           you. This is on you and the GM to work out together. The GM has
           the final say, though.

  98       If you and your allies flee RIGHT NOW, you don't take a campaign
           loss for your discretion. This may take some explaining. It's all
           about the chaos magic.

  99       Roll twice more on this table. If you wish you can ignore one of
           the rolled results but must stick with the other. If you roll the
           same result twice, you get that weirdness just once.

  100      You gain an extra standard action during the next turn after this
           weirdness goes into effect.

### Class Talents

Choose three of the following class talents.

#### Warp Talents

There are three separate Warp talents that you may choose from. They
provide random powers or features that surface unpredictably during
battles (and perhaps during non-combat moments of high tension).

If a warp talent gives you access to a spell from another class,
associate it with chaos magic's attack category or defense category. You
can then cast it if that spell type comes up for you.

##### Attacking Warp

Your magic provides you with a random warp effect when the next spell
you cast will be an attack spell. This talent works best for chaos mages
with a high Dexterity.

When your random spell choice indicates an attack spell, roll a d6 to
determine the effect you'll gain from the elemental warp. Even though
you can't cast the spell until your next turn, the warp effect applies
now.

  1    *Air*: You gain *flight* until the end of your next turn.

       your Dexterity modifier at 5^th^ level; triple it at 8^th^ level).

  6    *Void:* During your next turn, you can use a move action to
       teleport to a nearby location you can see.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

###### Adventurer Feat

When you roll a successful disengage check, you gain temporary hit

       level).

  4    *Water*: Until the end of your next turn, when you heal using a
       recovery, add hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier to that
       healing (double your Wisdom modifier at 5^th^ level; triple it at
       8^th^ level).

  5    *Metal*: Until the end of your next turn, you gain a +2 bonus to
       AC.

  6    *Void:* Until the end of your next turn, the first time an attack

       and MD equal to your Intelligence modifier.

  3    *Fire*: Until the end of your next turn, you gain the
       once-per-battle racial power of a random nearby ally; ignore this
       benefit if it duplicates your own racial power or if it doesn't
       make sense during the battle (human, for example).

  4    *Water*: Until the end of your next turn, you gain a bonus to
       saves equal to your Intelligence modifier.

  5    *Metal*: Until the end of your next turn, critical hits scored
       against you only count as normal hits.

  6    *Void:* When you roll a natural 20 with an attack, the critical
       hit range of your attacks expands by 2 until the end of the battle
       (cumulative).

You are ever-so-slightly detached from normal physical reality. Play the
story side of that as you like; the game mechanics side is that you can
cast ranged spells while engaged with enemies without taking opportunity
attacks.

from missed attacks.

##### Champion Feat

When you teleport, you can heal using a recovery.

#### Stench of Necromancy

You gain a random spell from the necromancer class. Whenever you take a
full heal-up, randomly choose a necromancer spell of the highest level
you can cast. For the rest of the day, you know this necromancer spell
and can cast it according to its normal usage pattern---at-will, once
per battle, recharge, or daily---when that option comes up during your
chaos mage spellcasting sequence.

If the necromancer spell refers to Intelligence, you can replace that
ability score with references to Charisma.

##### Adventurer Feat

One battle per day, you can gain the Cackling Soliloquist talent from
the necromancer class.

##### Champion Feat

While you have an *earth* or *metal* warp effect active, when an enemy
in the battle drops to 0 hp, you gain temporary hit points equal to your
Charisma modifier (double your Charisma modifier at 5^th^ level; triple
it at 8^th^ level).

##### Epic Feat

If you don't like the first random necromancer spell you select for the
day, you can determine another random necromancer spell. You're stuck
with the second one.

#### Touch of Wizardry

You gain a random spell from the wizard class. Whenever you take a full
heal-up, randomly choose a wizard spell of the highest level you can
cast. For the rest of the day, you know this wizard spell and can cast
it according to its normal usage pattern---at-will, cyclic, once per
battle, recharge, or daily---when that option comes up during your chaos
mage spellcasting sequence.

If the wizard spell refers to Intelligence, you can replace that ability
score with references to Charisma.

##### Adventurer Feat

You gain a random wizard talent at the start of each day. Roll a d3. 1:
Abjuration; 2: Evocation; 3: High Arcana (*counter magic*). Replace
references to "wizard" in these talents with "chaos mage" and
Intelligence with Charisma.

##### Champion Feat

You gain a single daily use of the wizard's *utility spell*, cast at

recharge, or daily---when that option comes up during your chaos mage
spellcasting sequence.

If the cleric spell refers to Wisdom, you can replace that ability score
with references to Charisma.

At the start of the day, choose a random cleric invocation, excepting
those from the healing domain. You can use that invocation as if you
were a cleric once this day as a quick action.

##### Champion Feat

While you have an *air* or *water* warp effect active, when you heal
using a recovery or cast a spell that lets an ally heal using a
recovery, add an extra recovery die to the healing.

##### Epic Feat

In addition to the random invocation you gain at the start of the day,
you also get the talent/domain powers that go with it.

#### Whiff of Sorcery

You gain a random spell from the sorcerer class. Whenever you take a
full heal-up, randomly choose a sorcerer spell of the highest level you
can cast. For the rest of the day, you know this sorcerer spell and can
cast it according to its normal usage pattern---at-will, once per
battle, recharge, or daily---when that option comes up during your chaos
mage spellcasting sequence.

##### Adventurer Feat

Twice per day, you can gather power as if you were a sorcerer in order
to deal double damage with either a sorcerer spell or a chaos mage spell
the next time you cast a spell. You also gain the chaotic benefit for
gathering power. (Note that you should have already determined the type
of spell you will be casting, since you select a spell type when you
roll initiative and at the end of each turn, so you're generally better
off waiting to gather power when you know you have an attack or iconic
spell coming.)

##### Champion Feat

While you have an *air* or *fire* warp effect active, add fire damage
equal to your Charisma modifier to your miss damage (double your
Charisma modifier at 5^th^ level; triple it at 8^th^ level).

##### Epic Feat

day, you can determine another random sorcerer spell. You're stuck with

> 9^th^ level spell: 9d10 damage, 25 temporary hit points.

###### Adventurer Feat

This spell now deals half damage on a miss.

###### Champion Feat

When the target drops to 0 hp, instead of gaining temporary hit points,
you can choose to deal that amount of negative energy damage to one
nearby enemy as a free action.

###### Epic Feat

This spell can now target a nearby enemy.

##### Unsummoning (7^th^ level+)

Ranged spell

Daily

**Target:** One nearby non-undead enemy that the GM hasn't given a
proper name, or that doesn't play a key role in the current storyline

**Attack:** Charisma + Level vs. MD

**Hit:** The target is sent elsewhere, possibly to a location that's
close enough for the PCs to have to deal with it in a subsequent battle.
It might also go somewhere "interesting."

Replace the target with the GM's choice of an undamaged and hostile
undead creature that is one level lower than the original target. If the
target was a large or double-strength creature, the replacement must be
large or double-strength, or perhaps two normal undead instead of one
show up. Ditto for huge/triple-strength targets. Therefore you're only
slightly reducing the raw power of the opposition; the advantage of
using the spell is that you're getting rid of an enemy you match up
badly against and dropping the level of the opposition by one. The
disadvantage, of course, is that you'll probably have to face that enemy
again.

**Miss:** 7d10 + Charisma psychic damage.

9^th^ level spell: 8d10 + Charisma psychic damage on a miss.

###### Champion Feat

This spell can now also target an entire mob of mooks. If the attack
hits, replace them with a mob of undead mooks that is one level lower.

###### Epic Feat

You don't expend the spell when you miss with it.

##### Holy Spark (1^st^ level+)

Ranged spell

At-Will

**Target:** One nearby enemy

**Attack:** Charisma + Level vs. PD

**Hit:** 1d8 + Charisma holy damage, and one nearby ally gains 3
temporary hit points.

**Miss:** Damage equal to your level.

> 3^rd^ level spell: 3d8 damage, 5 temporary hit points.
>
> 5^th^ level spell: 5d8 damage, 8 temporary hit points.
>
> 7^th^ level spell: 7d8 damage, 10 temporary hit points.
>
> 9^th^ level spell: 9d8 damage, 15 temporary hit points.

###### Adventurer Feat

When you miss with the spell, one of your nearby allies now gains the
temporary hit points.

###### Champion Feat

This spell now deals half damage on a miss.

###### Epic Feat

spell's damage dice increase by one size from d8s to d10s.

##### Temple Bells (1^st^ level+)

Daily

**Targets:** You and each nearby ally that has 10 hp or fewer

>

>
> 9^th^ level spell: Target with 100 hp or fewer.

###### Champion Feat

The recovery is now free.

###### Epic Feat

Add 50 hp to the hit point threshold for targets that can be affected.

##### Shadow Dance (1^st^ level+)

Ranged spell

At-Will

**Targets:** Two nearby creatures, enemies or allies (including you)

**Effect:** The targets teleport and swap places. Each teleported enemy
takes 1d6 damage. You and your allies don't take damage from
teleporting.

> 3^rd^ level spell: 2d6 damage.
>
> 5^th^ level spell: 2d10 damage.
>
> 7^th^ level spell: 3d12 damage.
>
> 9^th^ level spell: 4d12 damage.

###### Adventurer Feat

Once per day, one or more targets of the spell can be faraway.

###### Champion Feat

The damage increases by one die (for example, 2d10 becomes 3d10).

###### Epic Feat

The spell can now target up to three nearby creatures.

##### Step into Shadow (3^rd^ level+)

Close-quarters spell

Once per battle

**Effect:** Remove yourself from the battle (you can't be targeted by
attacks or effects while in the shadows). At the start of your next
turn, return to the battle nearby your previous location and roll a d6
to determine a random benefit you gain from coming out of the shadows.

> *1--4:* You can heal using a recovery.
>
> *5+:* You deal double damage to the first target you hit with a chaos
> mage spell this turn.

###### Champion Feat

> 5^th^ level spell: 5d6 damage, 9 ongoing damage.
>
> 7^th^ level spell: 7d8 damage, 12 ongoing damage.

> 9^th^ level spell: 9d8 damage, 18 ongoing damage.

###### Champion Feat

###### Epic Feat

The first save against the ongoing damage from a natural even miss is a
hard save (16+). The second and subsequent saves are normal.

##### Ancient Scales (3^rd^ level+)

Ranged spell

Daily

**Effect:** Until the end of the battle, you have *flight* while the
escalation die is even. While the escalation die is odd, you can cast
*twisted beam* once during your turn as a quick action.

### Class Features

All clerics have the Ritual Magic class feature. They also receive a
bonus spell: *heal*.

There are certain abilities specific to the cleric that can affect their
powers:

-   *Cast for power* and *cast for broad effect:* The spell can be used
    one of two ways---either as a more powerful effect on one target
    (power) or as a weaker effect on multiple targets (broad). Spells
    cast for power cannot target the caster. Spells cast for broad
    effect can.

-   *Free recovery*: The cleric can recover hit points as if they were
    using a recovery (without actually spending the recovery).

-   *Heal using a recovery*: The character targeted with a healing
    effect uses one of their recoveries and rolls their own recovery
    dice.

-   *Invocation*: A quick action that offers advantages in battle. It
    can be made once a day. More than one cleric in a party cannot use
    the same invocation during a battle.

#### Heal

Close-quarters spell

**Special:** You can use this spell twice per battle.

Quick action to cast (1/round)

**Target:** You or one ally you are next to

**Effect:** The target can heal using a recovery.

##### Adventurer Feat

The target can now be a nearby ally instead of an ally you are next to.

##### Champion Feat

If the target of your heal spell is an ally with 0 hp or below, that
ally also adds hit points equal to 1d10 x your Charisma modifier to the
recovery.

##### Epic Feat 

When you cast *heal* on an ally you are next to, that ally adds +30 hp
to the recovery.

#### Ritual Magic

Clerics can cast their spells as rituals. (See Rituals.)

### Class Talents

Choose three cleric talents/domains. Each talent/domain provides an
ability that can be improved by feats. It also provides an invocation
you can use as a quick action once per day, per battle, per party.

#### Domain: Healing

When you cast a spell that lets you or an ally heal using a recovery,
the target also adds hit points equal to double your level to the
recovery.

**Invocation of Healing:** This battle, you gain an additional use of
the *heal* spell. The first *heal* spell you cast after using this
invocation allows the target to heal using a free recovery instead of
spending a recovery.

##### Adventurer Feat

When you cast a spell that allows an ally to heal using a recovery, you
can let them use one of your recoveries instead. (If you also have the
Protection/Community domain, any nearby ally can expend the recovery
instead of you.)

##### Champion Feat

The *invocation of healing* gives you two additional uses of *heal* this
battle instead of only one.

##### Epic Feat

Increase the additional hit points the target heals to triple your
level.

#### Domain: Justice/Vengeance

Once per turn when an enemy scores a critical hit against you or a
nearby ally, or drops you or a nearby ally to 0 hp or below, you gain an
attack-reroll blessing. Immediately choose a nearby ally and give them
the blessing as a free action.

An ally with this blessing can use it to reroll an attack as a free
action this battle. An ally can only have one such blessing on them at a
time.

**Invocation of Justice/Vengeance:** This battle, add double your level
to the miss damage of your attacks and the attacks of your nearby
allies. (For example, your basic melee attack as a cleric will deal
triple your level as miss damage while this invocation is active.)

##### Adventurer Feat

You can take the attack-reroll blessing yourself.

##### Champion Feat

When you gain an attack-reroll blessing to distribute, you gain two
blessings to distribute instead.

##### Epic Feat

Attacks rolls from your reroll blessings gain a +4 bonus.

#### Domain: Knowledge/Lore

You gain 4 additional background points that must be used somehow in
relation to knowledge or lore.

**Invocation of Knowledge/Lore:** You must use this invocation during
your first round of a battle. When you do, you get a quick glimpse of
the battle's future. Roll a d6; as a free action at any point after the
escalation die equals the number you rolled, you can allow one of your
allies to reroll a single attack roll with a +2 bonus thanks to your
vision of this future.

##### Adventurer Feat

Once per day, you can change one of your skill checks involving
knowledge to a natural 20 instead. Interpret the word "knowledge" as
loosely as your GM allows. GMs, be generous.

##### Champion Feat

You now roll a d4 for the invocation, not a d6.

##### Epic Feat

You gain a different positive relationship point each day with a random
icon, purely because the icon has realized you know something they need
to know. It changes every day and it might contradict your usual icon
relationships.

#### Domain: Life/Death

You and your nearby allies gain a +1 bonus to death saves.

**Invocation of Life/Death:** This battle, you and each of your allies
can each separately add the escalation die to a single save made by that
character. In addition, you and your allies do not die from hit point
damage when your negative hit points equal half your normal hit points.
Instead, you die when your negative hit points equal your full hit
points.

##### Adventurer Feat

The death save bonus increases to +2.

##### Champion Feat

Each battle, the first time an ally near you becomes staggered, that
ally immediately heals hit points equal to twice your level.

##### Epic Feat

Your first use of the *resurrection* spell is free, and doesn't count
against your total.

#### Domain: Love/Beauty

Once per level, you can generate a one-point conflicted relationship
with a heroic or ambiguous icon you do not already have a relationship
with. The relationship point remains with you until you gain a level,
and then it's time for another one-level relationship.

##### Champion Feat

You gain two points in the relationship instead.

**Invocation of Love/Beauty:** As a free action, at some dramatic
moment, you or an ally of your choice can roll for one icon relationship
that might have an effect on the battle. Rolls of 5 and 6 are beneficial
as usual, though the GM will have to improvise what that means in the
middle of combat. The invocation's advantage does not occur the moment
you roll initiative; wait for a dramatic moment instead.

#### Domain: Protection/Community

Once per battle, you can affect two additional allies when you cast a
spell for broad effect.

##### Adventurer Feat

Whenever you target one or more allies with a spell, one ally of your
choice can roll a save against a save ends effect.

**Invocation of Protection/Community:** This battle, critical hits
against you and your nearby allies deal normal damage instead of
critical damage.

#### Domain: Strength

You can wield heavy/martial weapons without an attack penalty.

##### Adventurer Feat

Once per battle, you can deal extra damage to one target you hit with a
melee attack as a free action. The damage bonus is a number of d4 equal
to your Strength modifier or to your level, whichever is higher.

##### Champion Feat

You can use d8s instead of d4s for the bonus damage dice.

##### Epic Feat

Once per day, you can use d20s instead of d8s for the bonus damage dice.

**Invocation of Strength:** This battle, you and your nearby allies deal
triple damage instead of double damage on critical hits with melee
attacks.

#### Domain: Sun/Anti-Undead

Every attack you make deals holy damage instead of other types of damage
unless you choose otherwise for a specific attack.

##### Adventurer Feat

If your attack already deals holy damage, it gains the following bonus
damage---adventurer tier: +1 damage; champion tier: +2 damage; epic
tier: +3 damage.

##### Champion Feat

You gain a +2 bonus to all defenses against attacks by undead.

##### Epic Feat

The invocation also affects your allies' daily spells.

**Invocation of Sun/Anti-Undead:** When you cast a daily cleric spell
this battle, roll a d6. If you roll less than or equal to the escalation
die, you regain the use of that daily spell after the battle.

#### Domain: Trickery/Illusion

Once per battle, as a quick action when you are engaged with an enemy,
roll a d20 (your "trick die").

As a free action before the start of your next turn, give your trick die
to a nearby ally or enemy who is about to make an attack roll. The trick
die result becomes the natural result of their roll instead.

##### Champion Feat

Your trick die can be used for any one d20 roll, not just an attack.

##### Epic Feat

You get another trick die roll to use each battle the first time the
escalation die reaches 3+.

**Invocation of Trickery/Illusion:** This battle, attacks against you by
enemies that moved to engage you during their turn miss on natural odd
rolls.

#### Domain: War/Leadership

Once per turn when you make a melee attack against an enemy, hit or
miss, your allies gain a +1 attack bonus against that enemy until the
start of your next turn.

##### Adventurer Feat

The attack no longer has to be a melee attack, close and ranged attacks
also work.

##### Champion Feat

The bonus now applies against all enemies you attack; you no longer have
to single out one foe if you use a spell that attacks multiple enemies.

##### Epic Feat

Allies now also get a damage bonus against such enemies equal to double
your Charisma modifier.

**Invocation of War/Leadership:** Increase the escalation die by 1.

Daily

**Target:** 1d4 nearby undead creatures, each with 55 hp or fewer.

**Attack:** Wisdom + Charisma + Level vs. MD

**Hit:** The target is dazed until end of your next turn.

**Hit by 4+:** 1d10 x your level holy damage, and the target is dazed
until end of your next turn.

**Hit by 8+:** Against non-mooks, holy damage equal to half the target's
maximum hit points, and the target is dazed (save ends). Against mooks,
the +8 result now deals 4d10 x your level holy damage.

### 3^rd^ Level Spells

#### Cause Fear

Ranged spell

Daily

**Target:** One nearby enemy with 75 hp or fewer

**Attack:** Wisdom + Level vs. MD

**Hit:** The target is weakened until the end of its next turn. On its
next turn, if it's unengaged, it does not attack and moves away from
you. If it's engaged, the target attempts to disengage as its first
action, and moves away if it succeeds. If it fails, it moves away as its
second action (drawing opportunity attacks). In either case, it will not
attack unless it has no options for escape.

**Miss:** The target hates you for having tried to scare it, and it
wants to hurt you most of all, but it won't be any stupider than usual
in pursuing that goal.

> 5^th^ level spell: Target with 120 hp or fewer.
>

save automatically succeeds.

of its next turn.

9^th^ level spell: Attacks against the chosen defense cannot score
critical hits.

##### Epic Feat

The spell is now (recharge 16+) after battle instead of daily.

#### Resurrection

Ranged spell

**Special:** You can cast this spell only once per level, and a limited
number of times in your life. You must have most of the corpse available
to cast the spell. There's no time limit on resurrecting a dead PC, so
long as you have the corpse.

**Effect:** You can bring a creature back to life in more or less normal
condition, with varying levels of recovery.

**Limited Casting:** The first time in your life that you use the spell,
you can cast it with a single standard action. Using the spell removes
one of your spell slots until you gain a level. (You get one less spell
per full heal-up.) The person you are resurrecting comes back at roughly
half strength, e.g. expending half their recoveries, being dazed (save
ends), and, for each ability, having a 50% chance that it is expended.

The second time in your life you cast the spell, it takes at least three
or four rounds and costs you roughly half your hit points and daily
powers/spells. The person you are resurrecting comes back at something
like one-quarter strength.

The third time you cast the spell it has to be as a ritual. The spell
chews you up and leaves you with only a few hit points, then gnaws at
the person you have resurrected, who takes days to recover well enough
to qualify as an adventurer or combatant.

The fourth time you cast the spell it nearly kills you. The resurrection
succeeds but the person you've resurrected is going to be a mess for a
month or more, regardless of any other magic you use.

The fifth time you resurrect someone, that's the end of your story and
you die. There's only a 50% chance that the resurrection spell works on
the target. You've used up your quota of resurrection magic. You're not
coming back via this spell, either.

**Limited Resurrection:** If the target of your resurrection spell has
been resurrected more times than you have cast the spell, there is a 50%
chance that the experience will play out using *their* higher number of
resurrections instead of the number of times you have cast the spell.

9^th^ level spell: You no longer need to have most of the corpse to
perform this spell.

### 9^th^ Level Spells

#### Overworld Travel

Close-quarters spell

Daily

**Special:** You must cast this spell outdoors. It enables you and a
group of nearby allies to travel to most any location in the world that
you can name.

Travel takes between an hour and a day, depending on distance and the
amount of effort the exerted.

The destination can be in the overworld or in the land. It can't be in
the underworld.

#### Prayer for Readiness

Close-quarters spell

Daily

**Targets:** Up to 5 allies

**Effect:** You utter a powerful prayer upon your comrades, giving each
a special blessing. At any point later this battle, each blessed ally
can acknowledge the blessing by saying "thank you" to your god, gods, or
pantheon as a free action to reroll a d20 roll. That ally must take the
reroll result.

Note that you are giving the blessing and don't receive it yourself.

##### Epic Feat

This spell is now a quick action to cast.

### Class Features

All commanders have class features associated with *commands* and
*tactics*.

Commands allow you to help your allies fight better. You issue them as
interrupt actions during their turn. To issue a command, the ally must
be conscious, but line of sight isn't required.

All commands are at-will powers, though they do cost command points, and
are usually limited to once per round (as an interrupt). You start each
battle with 1 command point and generally gain more via the two standard
commander features: *Fight from the Front* and *Weigh the Odds*. Excess
command points go away at the end of the battle.

Your powers also include tactics that have immediate effect during your
turn. Tactics, as opposed to commands, don't use command points. You
also don't have to wait around for an ally's turn to use them. However,
tactics don't always recharge after a battle.

You can choose the commands and tactics you want to use. A 1^st^-level
commander starts with a total of 4 commands and tactics. An effective
commander should choose a good balance of commands and tactics.

#### Fight from the Front

When you hit with a commander melee attack during your turn, gain 1d3
command points.

##### Adventurer Feat

You now gain 1d4 command points when you hit with a melee attack during
your turn instead of 1d3.

##### Champion Feat

When you make a melee attack during your turn and miss with a natural
even roll, gain 1 command point.

##### Epic Feat

Twice per day when you hit with a melee attack, you can gain additional
command points equal to double your Strength modifier.

#### Weigh the Odds

Standard action

**Effect:** Gain 1d4 command points.

##### Adventurer Feat

Once per day, add your Charisma modifier to the number of command points
you gain when you use this action.

##### Champion Feat

Once per battle while the escalation die is 3+, you can gain 1d4 command
points as a quick action.

##### Epic Feat

You now gain 1d6 command points instead of 1d4 when you use this action.

### Class Talents

Choose three of the following class talents. You get an additional
commander talent at 5^th^ level.

#### Armor Skills

Unlike other commanders, you take no attack penalties for fighting in
heavy armor. (As indicated on your class chart, your base AC in heavy
armor is 14.)

##### Adventurer Feat

When an enemy misses you with a melee attack and rolls a natural 1 or 2,
you gain 1 command point.

##### Champion Feat

Once per day as a free action when you are hit by an attack that targets
AC, you can take half damage from that attack instead.

##### Epic Feat

Once per day as a free action, you can gain a bonus to AC equal to the
*current* escalation die until the end of the battle. (The AC bonus
increases or decreases as the escalation die increases or decreases.)
This bonus can't be higher than the number of icon relationship points
you have with warrior or leader icons in your game.

#### Battle Captain

Once per battle when you have 2 or more command points left after giving
a command, you can use another interrupt action on a different ally's
turn before the start of your next turn.

##### Adventurer Feat

You now only need to have 1 or more command points left instead of 2.

##### Champion Feat

You can use this talent twice per battle.

##### Epic Feat

You gain an additional command point at the start of each round while
the escalation die is 4+.

#### Combat Maneuver

Choose a fighter maneuver of your level or lower. You can use it like a
fighter. You can also switch it for a different maneuver each time you
level up.

##### Adventurer Feat

You gain the adventurer feat for the maneuver you chose, if any.

##### Champion Feat

Choose a second fighter maneuver of your level or lower to use.

##### Epic Feat

You gain the adventurer and champion tier feats, if any, for both your
fighter maneuvers.

#### Destined to Lead

When you roll a 5 or 6 on an icon relationship die, you gain 2 bonus
command points that last until the end of the current game session, no
matter what events occur due to the advantage gained with that icon.

When you use one or more of these bonus command points, tell a story
about how something related to the icon (or icons!) comes into play to
make you a better/luckier/destined commander.

##### Adventurer Feat

You now gain the 2 bonus command points when you roll a 4 with an icon
relationship die as well.

Once per session when you roll icon relationship dice, you can reroll
one die that isn't a 5 or a 6.

When you roll icon relationship dice, for each 6 you get, you and each
nearby ally gain a +1 bonus to death saves until the next full heal-up.

#### Forceful Command

When you give a command that lets an ally roll a d20 (an attack, a save,
etc.), you can spend additional command points before the roll up to the
escalation die value, or 1 point if the escalation die is still 0. That
ally gains a +2 bonus to the roll for each point you spend this way.

##### Adventurer Feat

You begin each battle with 1 additional command point.

##### Champion Feat

Once per battle, you can use a command on a faraway ally.

##### Epic Feat

roll, you can also allow that ally to reroll that roll once as a free
action.

#### Into the Fray

At the start of each battle before you and your allies roll initiative,
roll a d4. A number of your allies equal to the roll gain the following
benefit of your choice: a +4 bonus to initiative that battle; OR a +2
bonus to AC until the end of the first round.

##### Adventurer Feat

You also gain the chosen bonus.

##### Champion Feat

The +2 bonus to AC also applies to PD and MD.

Twice per day as a free action (once per turn), you can reroll one of
your melee attack rolls.

Twice per day as free action (once per turn) when you hit with a melee
attack, you can deal 1d10 extra damage to the target for each positive
or conflicted icon relationship point you have with warrior or leader
icons in your game.

#### Moment of Glory

When you roll initiative, also roll a d4 and record the result. As a
free action, you can add the result to a single attack roll made by one
of your nearby allies later this battle. (It's a free action, so you can
add the result after seeing the roll.)

##### Adventurer Feat

You can also add the d4 result to a save or dicey-move roll made by an
ally.

##### Champion Feat

Roll a d6 instead of a d4.

##### Epic Feat

In addition to the d6 you roll with initiative, roll a d4. You can also

nearby ally, you can increase the escalation die by 1.

a recovery.

##### Epic Feat

When you use this talent, you and each of your nearby allies gains a +2
bonus to all defenses until the end of your next turn.

#### Strategist

You rely on planning, teamwork, and calm execution of orders as a
commander instead of charismatic presence. Any time an element of the
commander class refers to Charisma, you can replace that element with a
reference to Intelligence.

In addition, you start every battle with 1 additional command point.

tactics targets, add +1 to the result.

##### Epic Feat

Once per day as a free action, you can gain a number of command points
equal to your Intelligence modifier.

When your melee attack drops a non-mook enemy to 0 hp, or drops three or
more mooks, you gain 1 command point.

You only have to drop 2 or more mooks instead of 3 to gain the command
point.

##### Champion Feat

You gain 2 command points instead of 1 when you drop a non-mook enemy to
0 hp.

##### Epic Feat

Once per day as a quick action, you can gain command points equal to the
number of icon relationship points you have with the any one icon
associated with battle or victory.

#### Tactician

You rely on perception, intuition, and common sense as a commander
instead of charismatic presence. Any time an element of the commander
class refers to Charisma, you can replace that element with a reference
to Wisdom.

In addition, one battle per day, you can reroll your initiative if you
don't like the first result. You must take the re-rolled result.

##### Adventurer Feat

You gain 1 additional point in a background related to military history,
strategy, command, or warfare. You can use this background point to
raise that background beyond the normal maximum of 5.

##### Champion Feat

you make for your expended tactics equal to your Wisdom modifier.

##### Epic Feat

Once per day as a free action, you can choose a tactic you don't

associated with it).

### Class Features

Druids use divine implements, such as symbols and staffs, to improve
their spellcasting. They can choose up to three talents to have many
useful aptitudes, or they can specialize by putting two points into one
talent (and the other into another talent). A druid who chooses three
separate talents is an *initiate* in each one. Investing two points into
a single talent allows the druid to become *adept* in that talent,
thereby gaining more power at the expense of options, and an *initiate*
in another talent.

As a druid, you choose whether you want to use Strength or Dexterity as
the ability score you will use to determine attack and damage for your
basic attacks. Choosing Strength as your melee attack ability score
provides one significant benefit: your recovery dice become d10s instead
of the d6s used by other druids. Choosing Dexterity as your melee attack
ability score works well because Dexterity already boosts your
initiative and ranged weapon attacks and might help your AC.

You never suffer from natural weather-related cold, heat, or exposure.
You can go longer than most people without eating or drinking, but only
a couple days longer.

You can also talk to plants and animals. If there is useful information
to gain, roll a skill check that's appropriate for the tier. Talking to
animals requires a hard DC, and plants usually require a ridiculously
hard DC. A druid gains a +1 bonus when talking with animals for every
talent spent on the Shifter or Animal Companion talents. A druid gains a
+1 bonus when talking with plants for every talent spent on the Terrain
Caster talent.

#### Adventurer Feat

You can talk with plants and animals pretty much as often you like, and
you gain a +5 bonus to any skill checks involved.

### Druid Talents

Each of your talents unlocks pools of spells and powers that are not
available to characters who lack the talent. Druids who choose to be an
adept with a talent gain additional benefits and powers in that talent.

***Animal Companion:*** As an initiate talent, it's based on the
ranger's Animal Companion talent, but it's only useful in half your
battles instead of all the time. If you choose to be an Animal Companion
adept, your animal companion will be with you every battle and you also
learn spells that make your animal companion more effective.

***Elemental Caster:*** This talent is one of the druid's two main
spellcasting options. As an initiate talent, it grants access to a wide
range of daily spells associated with air, earth, fire, and water.
Becoming an Elemental Caster adept increases the number of spells you
know and provides greater access to summoned elementals. As either an
initiate or an adept, you can use adventurer-tier elemental mastery
feats to gain at-will spell attacks.

***Shifter:*** This talent enables you to shift your form in two ways:
scout form transformations into quick-moving animals for out of combat
reconnaissance, and beast form transformations into combat-ready
predators. Adepts gain more benefits while fighting in beast form.

***Terrain Caster:*** This talent is the druid's other major
spellcasting option. As an initiate, you gain access to daily spells
that you can only cast in one of the eight specific types of terrain.
Adepts get twice as many daily spells. Feats provide at-will spell
attacks that can be used regardless of what terrain you are in.

***Warrior Druid:*** This talent lets a druid use once-per-battle
flexible attacks that enable them to fight as a serious melee combatant
in humanoid form. Generally, this talent makes druids into weapon and
shield users, but the talent can integrate with the Shifter talent while
a druid fights in beast form.

***Wild Healer:*** As an initiate talent, it gives you access to
*regeneration* spells and eventually a *wild heal* spell. Adepts get
enough *regeneration* spells, *wild heal* spells, and *greater
regeneration* spells to be a primary healer in any adventuring group.

#### Animal Companion

You have a normal-sized animal companion that fights alongside you in
battle. See Animal Companion Rules.

#### Elemental Caster

As an elemental caster, you can summon elementals and draw on the raw
magic of nature, providing many powerful daily spells. Like a wizard or
cleric, you choose the Elemental Caster spells you will be able to cast
after each full heal-up.

You can choose as many feats as you wish from feat trees related to
mastering the four elements: air, earth, fire and water. The
adventurer-tier feats for the elemental masteries provide access to
at-will attack spells. You cast these at-will spells at your current
level or one level below (when you're at even levels).

Elemental caster initiates can cast fewer daily spells than adepts.
Adepts are also able to use two different *summon elemental* spells each
day, to the initiate's one.

##### 3^rd^ Level Spells

The 3^rd^ level Elemental Caster spells are the four elemental summoning
spells: *summon air elemental*, *summon earth elemental*, *summon fire
elemental*, and *summon water elemental*. Each summoning spell summons
an elemental of the same level as the spell.

Summoned elementals start battles with half the hit points of standard
elementals.

Each elemental that's at least 5^th^ level has a transformation ability
that greatly improves its effectiveness in battle. Free elementals
transform the first time they succeed with their transformation rolls,
but summoned elementals have to succeed with their transformation rolls
*twice* before their transformation takes effect.

Initiates can choose only one *summon elemental* spell each day, while
adepts can choose up to two.

(See Summoning Rules for the basic summoning rules.)

These feats apply to the following summoning spells.

###### Adventurer Feat

Your summoned creatures can arrive anywhere you can see nearby, instead
of needing to appear beside you.

###### Champion Feat

When you summon a non-mook creature, roll 2d10 and add double your
Strength modifier or Dexterity modifier, whichever is higher. Your
summoned creature increases its base hit points by that amount. (At
8^th^ level, roll 3d10 and add triple the modifier.)

###### Epic Feat

Once per day when you heal using a recovery, a creature you summoned can
heal the same amount, ignoring the usual restrictions on limited healing
for summoned creatures.

that you cast the spell.)

the target fails, it expends that action to no effect.

9^th^ level spell: You can now choose which creatures in the battle the
spell targets.

sight to that creature.

9^th^ level spell: 10d12 damage; 25 miss damage.

##### 9^th^ Level Spells

###### Wall of Stone (Earth)

Ranged spell

Daily

**Effect:** You create a more or less impenetrable wall of stone that's
pretty big. You can't drop it on top of enemies or bend it after
creating it, but it can form natural flowing shapes like a river of
stone that's at most 40 feet high, 120 feet long, and 10 feet thick. If
you're straining to come up with nasty ways to use the wall, you're
breaking the spirit of the spell, since it's just supposed to be a stone
wall that blocks most other creatures' movements.

You, the spellcasting druid, can move through the wall at will, but you
can't end your turn inside it.

The wall isn't permanent: walls of stone generally disappear at sunrise
or sunset.

##### Summoning Rules

These general rules also apply to the necromancer's Summoning class
feature.

###### Standard action spells

Casting a summoning spell generally requires a standard action. The
creature(s) you summon appears next to you, though feats or powers might
enable you to summon it nearby instead.

###### Duration

A summoned creature fights for you until the end of the battle or until
it drops to 0 hit points. At 0 hp, summoned creatures are slain and
removed from the battle.

###### One summoning spell at a time

Each spellcaster can have only a single summoning spell active at a
time. If all the creatures from an earlier summoning spell have been
slain, you're free to cast another. Alternatively, you can dismiss your
own previously summoned creatures as a quick action to clear the way for
a new summoning spell.

###### Halfway there

Summoned creatures are not the same as real creatures. They're partly
real, partly magical. Their abilities don't always match the
capabilities of the creatures that the adventurers encounter *for real*.
Sometimes this is reflected in a summoned creature's attacks or
abilities. It's always reflected in a summoned creature's hit points.

###### Hit points

Each summoned creature stat block indicates its base hit points.
Starting hit points for summoned creatures are nearly always lower than
hit points for non-summoned versions of the same creature. Some class
feats might increase the hit points of summoned creatures.

###### Actions on arrival

The turn you summon a creature, that creature takes its turn immediately
after your turn in initiative order. During its turn, the summoned
creature can act like any other creature, taking a standard, move, and
quick action. The summoned creature continues to take its turn
immediately after you (even if your initiative order changes) until the
end of the battle.

###### Escalation die

As a rule, summoned creatures don't benefit from the escalation die. A
summoned creature can add the escalation die to attacks, however, if
*you use a quick action* to give it orders or magical reinforcement. The
summoned creature then gets to use the escalation die until the start of
your next turn, including for opportunity attacks and other attacks that
it gets to make during other creatures' turns.

For example, during the turn you summon the creature, you use a quick
action afterward to give it orders, allowing it to use the escalation
die bonus. At the start of your next turn, the creature no longer gets
to use the escalation die, so you'll have to use another quick action
again during that turn for the creature to keep getting the benefit.

If you've summoned a mob of mooks, a single quick action lets every
member of the mob use the escalation die.

###### Allies

Summoned creatures generally count as your allies (for roleplaying as
well as for resolving effects).

###### No recoveries, bad healing

Summoned creatures don't have recoveries. If you cast a healing spell on
a summoned creature that requires the use of a recovery, the summoned
creature heals hit points equal to your level. If you use an effect that
would heal a summoned creature without using a recovery, the summoned
creature only heals half the normal hit points of the effect. Temporary
hit points still work normally.

###### No nastier specials

Creatures you summon don't use nastier specials.

###### Spell or creature

When a summoning spell is cast, it's definitely a spell. After casting
the spell, a summoned creature is a creature.

#### Shifter

You glory in shifting into the forms of animals that nature blessed with
keen eyes, swift wings, and terrible fangs. You also gain a number of
aspects that you can assume while battling in beast form to improve your
capabilities.

##### Scout Form

Scout forms are magical versions of normal, smaller animals that are
useful for scouting, such as bobcats, coyotes, owls, lizards, dire rats,
giant spiders, and so on. In scout form, you shouldn't have any problem
slipping through the world without being troubled by any but the most
serious defenses. However, you don't look like a natural animal; there's
something extremely magical about you.

Becoming a small animal isn't a perfect translation of self. Your
humanoid brain doesn't work the same when you've shifted into scout
form. You don't talk. You can't cast spells. Your magical items and
possessions change shape with you, but you don't get to use them in
scout form. You maintain your identity and know who your allies are, but
you're as much an animal as a person while in the form.

###### Fighting in Scout Form

Fighting in scout form should be avoided unless you're fighting a
mundane animal. If you do attempt to fight, your attacker hits you
unless he rolls a natural 1, and taking damage this way transforms you
back into humanoid form.

###### Shifting Into Scout Form and Back

Transforming from humanoid or beast form into scout form requires a
standard action. To transform back to human form from scout form
requires a quick action. A Shifter adept can transform directly from
scout to beast form (as a quick action), but a Shifter initiate must
transform to human form first. You can only shift once per round. You
can stay in scout form as long as you like, or switch back to humanoid
form and then back again the next round.

###### Using Scout Form Shifts

Shifting into scout form is a daily, but you can do it at will. You can
shift for roleplaying reasons, or for combat reconnaissance. To gain an
advantage for an upcoming battle (or one just about to start), using
your scout form requires a skill check.

Before rolling initiative, you expend one daily scout form use and roll
a skill check to see how successful you were with your combat recon.
Depending on the terrain, the weather, and the particular enemies or
dangers, the GM will ask you to use an ability score that makes sense
for the situation just like any other check, though Wisdom, Dexterity,
and Strength are often common choices.

You'll normally roll against the standard difficulty of the current
environment. While in scout form in an adventurer-tier area, the normal
check starts at DC 15, a hard check is DC 20, and a ridiculously hard
check is DC 25. Champion tier increases the DC by 5, and epic tier by 5
more. Note that a successful check that qualifies for a higher DC gains
you the information/advantage for that result, plus any lower results. A
normal success or better probably negates any chance of an ambush or
surprise by the enemy you've scouted.

**Failure:** Nothing came of your scouting.

**Normal success:** You gain a +4 bonus to initiative this battle.

**Hard success:** As a free action at some point during the battle, you
can grant one of your allies a reroll on an attack roll or save. That
ally must take the new result. You must explain how something that
happened while you were scouting contributed to this benefit.

**Ridiculously hard success:** The GM chooses between giving *you* a
reroll at some point during the battle, or giving you a floating
story-guide icon relationship result of 6 with a random icon.

You only need to take one of the two adventurer-tier feats to access the
champion-tier feat. You can also take both adventurer-tier feats, if you
wish.

####### Adventurer Feat

Your temporary animal background roll is a 1d6 instead of 1d4 + 1, and
count a 1 rolled as a 2.

####### Adventurer Feat

A normal success with your combat recon skill check also grants your
allies a +2 bonus to initiative this battle.

####### Champion Feat

Rerolls from your combat recon exploits gain a +2 bonus.

####### Epic Feat

You now get two benefits instead of one when you succeed at a
ridiculously hard skill check with your scout form.

##### Beast Form

Shifter initiates have a certain number of uses of beast form each day,
allowing them to fight one or more battles in the shape of powerful
predators. Since beast form transformations are like other daily powers,
lasting no more than five minutes, Shifter initiates seldom stay in
beast form, instead moving around in humanoid form or scout form.

Shifter adepts can use beast form at-will.

###### Beast Form

Daily for Shifter initiates (1 or 2 uses)

At-Will for Shifter adepts

Quick action

**Effect:** You leave your humanoid form behind and assume the form of a
deadly predator such as a wolf, panther, tiger, bear, wolverine, lion,
or another animal that you are naturally connected to.

The choice of what type of animal you become is up to you. You don't
always have to change into the same thing---your choices can suit the
story. Stick to four-legged natural predators, not creatures with
supernatural abilities or the ability to fly.

Shifter adepts can speak in growly voices and cast spells while in beast
form. Shifter initiates can speak in beast form but can't cast spells
unless they take the champion-tier feat below.

***Magic items:*** Your magic items stick with you and you get the
benefit of their default bonuses. Yes, this means the bonuses from your
magic axe translate to your beast form. Shifter adepts can use their
magic item powers while in beast form. Shifter initiates can't, but see
the champion-tier feat below.

***Beast form actions:*** Shifter adepts can shift freely between
humanoid form and beast form during a battle. Shifter initiates who
shift into beast form use up one of their daily beast form shifts, but
they can shift between beast form and humanoid form without using a
daily shift for the rest of that battle.

For both adepts and initiates, shifting to humanoid form during your
turn is a quick action. So is shifting back to beast form.

***Beast aspects:*** While in beast form, you can take on aspects of
different beasts to help you in battle (see below). You don't have to
use the aspects; they're an option to improve your beast form attacks
and powers, not a requirement.

While in beast form, you attack in melee using a *beast form attack*.

###### Beast Form Attack

Melee attack

At-Will

**Attack:** Strength or Dexterity + Level vs. AC

**Natural Even Hit:** 1d10 damage per level + Strength or Dexterity
damage.

**Natural Odd Hit:** 1d6 damage per level + Strength or Dexterity
damage.

**Miss:** Repeat the attack against the same or a different target. This
second attack has no *miss* effect.

####### Adventurer Feat

For both initiates and adepts, your second beast form attack (the one
you roll when the first attack misses) now deals miss damage equal to
your level. If you are a Shifter adept, you can have two beast aspects
active at the same time. If you start using a third aspect, one of the
two previous aspects of your choice ends.

####### Champion Feat

If you are a Shifter initiate, you can now cast spells and use magic
item powers while in beast form. If you are a Shifter adept, you can
have three beast aspects active at the same time. If you start using a
fourth aspect, one of the two previous aspects of your choice ends.

####### Epic Feat

If you are a Shifter adept, your beast form can now be a lycanthropic
form when you wish---furred, deadly, and possessing a new power that you
can use only while in lycanthropic form: *shake it off*.

####### Shake It Off

**Special:** You gain access to this power by taking the epic feat for
*beast form attack*. To use it, you must be using at least one beast
aspect.

**Recharge** 16+ after battle

Free action

**Trigger:** You take damage while fighting in beast form

**Effect:** You end a beast aspect power that you are using and then
take only 6d6 damage from the triggering attack and ignore the rest of
the damage. You still suffer any other effects of the attack (including
ongoing damage).

###### Beast Aspect

Beast aspects are powers you can use while in beast form to help you in
battle. You must choose the aspects you know at each full heal-up. You
can select any of the following aspects beginning at 1^st^ level.

Normally you can use only one beast aspect at a time and using another
aspect ends the previous one. The *beast form attack* feats change that
for the Shifter adept.

***Beast aspect bonuses*:** Many beast aspects provide bonuses to
defenses or attacks. Shifter adepts can combine bonuses to the same
stats from two aspects they are using simultaneously, an exception to
the general rule that bonuses don't stack. For example, a Shifter adept
using *bear aspect* with its champion feat would have a +2 AC, and if
the adept was also using *behemoth aspect* with its champion feat, the
total defensive bonuses for the adept would be +5 AC and +3 PD.

***Effects:*** Beast aspects only affect you while you are in beast
form, which means that every aspect should be understood to read "while
in beast form" for all its effects and powers.

Shifting out of beast form to humanoid form prevents a beast aspect from
having any effect, but it doesn't end the aspect. When you shift back to
beast form, the aspect is in effect again. Aspects last until the end of
the battle.

***Appearances:*** The names of the aspects are a guide to what you
might look like when channeling that beast, but it's also possible to
decide that your usual beast form is, for example, wolf-like, and that
using bear aspect or behemoth aspect merely adds bear-like or
behemoth-like qualities to your standard wolf-shape.

####### Bear Aspect

Beast aspect

Daily, or recharge 16+ for adepts

Quick action

**Initiate Effect:** Until the end of the battle, while in beast form
you gain a +2 bonus to attacks and damage against lower level enemies
and mooks of any level (damage bonus increases to 2 + double your
Strength or Dexterity modifier at 5^th^ level; damage bonus increases to
2 + triple your Strength or Dexterity modifier at 8^th^ level).

**Adept Effect:** As the initiate effect, and when you first shift into
this aspect, roll your recovery dice as if you were healing, but you
instead gain that many temporary hit points. You don't spend a recovery.

######## Adventurer Feat

The initiate effect's attack bonus is now +4 instead of +2.

######## Champion Feat

Adepts also gain a +2 AC bonus while using this aspect.

######## Epic Feat

Until the first time it recharges each day, *bear aspect* is recharge
11+ instead of recharge 16+ for adepts.

####### Behemoth Aspect

Beast aspect

Daily, or recharge 16+ for adepts

Quick action

**Initiate Effect:** You gain a +2 bonus to AC and PD.

**Adept Effect:** As the initiate effect, and the first time you become
staggered this battle, roll a hard save (16+). If you fail, choose one
of the two following benefits. If you succeed, you get both.

*Endurance:* You can heal using a recovery.

*Wrath:* Begin rolling 2d20 for each of your melee attacks and choose
the result you prefer until the end of the battle or until you make both
rolls for a melee attack and each roll is a natural 10 or less.

######## Adventurer Feat

The recovery from the adept's *endurance* effect is now free.

######## Champion Feat

For adepts, the bonus to AC and PD is now +3 instead of +2.

######## Epic Feat

The save that determines the adept's benefit(s) is now a normal save.

####### Mantis Aspect

Beast aspect

Daily, or recharge 16+ for adepts

Quick action

**Initiate Effect:** Until the end of the battle, when an enemy engaged
with you fails a disengage check, you can make an opportunity attack
against it. In addition, your natural even beast form attack rolls that
would normally deal damage equal to your level deal half damage instead.

**Adept Effect:** As the initiate effect, and you gain a +1d3 bonus to
AC and a +1d3 bonus to PD (two separate rolls). Insects are
unpredictable.

######## Adventurer Feat

When an enemy attempts to disengage from you while you are using this
aspect, it takes a penalty to the check equal to your Strength or
Dexterity modifier.

######## Champion Feat

Adept effect bonuses are now d4s instead of d3s.

######## Epic Feat

Until the first time it recharges each day, *mantis aspect* is recharge
11+ instead of recharge 16+ for adepts.

####### Leopard Aspect

Beast aspect

Daily, or recharge 16+ for adepts

Quick action

**Initiate Effect:** Until the end of the battle, when an enemy misses
you with a melee attack and rolls a natural 1--4, you gain an additional
standard action during your next turn. You can only gain one additional
standard action a turn this way. Powers like *elven grace* or a command
won't stack with this effect either.

**Adept Effect:** As the initiate effect, and you gain a +2 bonus to AC.
You also gain a +5 bonus to disengage checks and to saves against being
stuck, dazed, or stunned.

####### Owlbear Aspect

Beast aspect

Daily, or recharge 16+ for adepts

Quick action

**Initiate Effect:** Until the end of the battle, your crit range with
melee attacks expands by 2.

**Adept Effect:** As the initiate effect, and you gain a +1 bonus to
melee attacks and a +2 bonus to AC and PD.

######## Adventurer Feat

When you score a critical hit, you heal hit points equal to your level +
your Wisdom modifier (double your Wisdom modifier at 5^th^ level; triple
it at 8^th^ level).

######## Champion Feat

While you are in this aspect, your critical hits with melee attacks deal
triple damage instead of double damage.

######## Epic Feat

Until the first time it recharges each day, *owlbear aspect* is recharge
11+ instead of recharge 16+ for adepts.

####### Tiger Aspect

Beast aspect

Daily, or recharge 16+ for adepts

Quick action

**Initiate Effect:** Until the end of the battle, you gain the benefits
of two-weapon fighting: if your attack roll is a natural 2, you can
reroll the attack, but must use the reroll. In addition, the crit range
of attacks you reroll this way expands by 4.

**Adept Effect:** As the initiate effect, and increase the size of your
beast form melee attack damage dice by one size (for example, d6s become
d8s, and d10s become 12s).

######## Adventurer Feat

You also gain a +2 attack bonus with any attack you reroll while using
this aspect.

######## Champion Feat

When you move and then attack an enemy you were not engaged with at the
start of your turn, you can reroll your first natural odd attack roll
each turn, but must use the reroll. (The initiate effect bonuses don't
apply to this reroll.)

######## Epic Feat

Until the first time it recharges each day, *tiger aspect* is recharge
11+ instead of recharge 16+ for adepts.

####### Wolverine Aspect

Beast aspect

Daily, or recharge 16+ for adepts

Quick action

**Initiate Effect:** Until the end of the battle, when your melee
attacks hit an enemy that has more hit points than you, the target takes
1d6 extra damage from the hit.

**Adept Effect:** As the initiate effect, and you gain a +2 bonus to all
defenses. You can also rally once this battle as a quick action instead
of a standard action.

######## Adventurer Feat

Your extra melee damage while using this aspect increases according to
your level:

> 2^nd^ level druid: +1d8 damage.
>
> 4^th^ level druid: +1d10 damage.
>
> 6^th^ level druid: +2d6 damage.
>
> 8^th^ level druid: +3d6 damage.
>

######## Champion Feat

You can use the damage bonus against an enemy that started the battle
with more hit points than you, but no longer does.

######## Epic Feat

Until the first time it recharges each day, *wolverine aspect* is
recharge 11+ instead of recharge 16+ for adepts.

#### Terrain Caster

There are eight different ranges of terrain that are relevant to druidic
magic:

1.  cave, dungeon, underworld

2.  forest, woods

3.  ice, snowfields, tundra

4.  migration route (large herd animal)

5.  mountains

6.  plains, overworld

7.  ruins

8.  swamp, lake, river

At-will or once-per-battle spells provided by terrain caster adventurer
feats can be cast in any terrain you like. Daily spells must match the
type of terrain you're in, though you don't have to memorize them like a
wizard, and the spell level you cast them at is your current character
level.

Terrains need not be exclusive; ruins can exist on mountains, and the
terrain caster can draw upon each. Any ambiguity should be decided by
the GM.

##### Cave, Dungeon, Underworld

###### Adventurer Feat

You gain the *ways of the dark* spell below.

###### Champion Feat

Once per battle, when an attack targeting MD hits you while you're not
fighting in bright sunlight, you can force the attacker to reroll that
attack, but you must accept the reroll.

###### Epic Feat

You can now cast one bonus daily cave/dungeon/underworld spell that
doesn't count against your total daily spells, but you still can't cast
a specific daily spell of that type more than once per day.

###### Ways of the Dark (Terrain Feat Spell)

At-Will (in any terrain)

Ranged spell

**Target:** One nearby enemy

**Attack:** Wisdom + Level vs. MD

**Natural Even Hit:** As a hit, plus the target can't attack the druid
until the end of its next turn unless the druid moves to engage the
target.

**Miss:** Damage equal to your level.

> 3^rd^ level spell: 2d8 damage.
>
> 5^th^ level spell: 3d8 damage.
>

Daily

Quick action to cast

**Target:** You

**Effect:** Until the end of the battle or for five minutes, you can
climb up sheer surfaces and stick to ceilings as if you were a spider.
You can fight and cast spells normally while climbing.

> 3^rd^ level spell: If you're fighting while standing upside down on a
> ceiling or sideways on a wall, you can reroll the first natural odd
> attack roll you get if you tell a fun story about how the *spider
> climb* effect is letting you fight better than you ordinarily would!
>

> allies.

###### Fungal Ambuscade (3^rd^ level)

Ranged spell

Daily

**Target:** One nearby enemy

**Attack:** Wisdom + Level vs. PD

**Hit:** The target takes 15 ongoing poison damage (two saves ends).

**Miss:** The target takes 5 ongoing poison damage (two saves ends).

> 5^th^ level spell: 25 ongoing damage on a hit, 10 ongoing damage on a

###### Spikestones (5^th^ level)

Ranged spell

Daily

**Effect:** Until the end of the battle, the area the battle is
occurring in is dangerous to move in. When an enemy moves through the
area on the ground (enemies using *teleport* or similar powers aren't
affected), it must roll a normal save that turn. On a failure, that
creature takes 7d6 damage. If they move again that turn, they don't have
to roll a save.

You can move normally in the area. Your allies must roll an easy save
(6+); if they fail they take half damage when they move.

Since the spell normally only works underground, it affects creatures
with *flight* because it's assumed that nasty stalactites jut out from
the ceiling as well as the walls and floors. If you're in a *giant*
cavern when you cast it, fliers could probably zip around away from
surfaces without too much trouble (GM's call).

> 7^th^ level spell: 7d10 damage.
>
> 9^th^ level spell: 9d10 damage.

##### Forest, Woods

of any migratory beast herd in the world.

When you teleport, roll a d20. If you roll a 1, something unusual

desired herd. Unlike the wizard's 9^th^ level *teleport* spell, this
spell doesn't allow you to choose your precise destination.

Any effects of spells or items cast/created before teleporting are
canceled and no longer function on arrival, so it's best to wait and use
such spells after you arrive.

> 9^th^ level spell: You can now try to teleport to any location along
> the migration route. Stabbing your finger on the world map suffices,
> but your aim won't be perfect. Attempts to teleport to places off the
> map to the north or west usually don't work.

Ranged spell

Daily

Quick action to cast

**Effect:** During your next turn, you can cast a 3^rd^ level daily Air
or Fire spell from the Elemental Caster's spell list even if you don't
ordinarily know that spell. The only limitation is that the spell can't
be a *summon elemental* spell. Casting that spell neither counts against
your daily Elemental Caster spell limit if you have that talent, nor
does it count against your daily Terrain Caster spell limit.

you still expend this daily spell.

of that type more than once per day.

#### Warrior Druid

Choose this talent if you want to fight well in melee with your normal
weapons and armor.

Spending a single talent on Warrior Druid lets you choose *one* of the
three following benefits:

-   Your AC in light armor is 12 instead of 10 like most other druids.

-   You don't take opportunity attacks from enemies engaged with you
    when you cast ranged druid spells.

-   Your base hit points are 7 + CON mod instead of 6 + CON mod.

If you use two talents to become a Warrior Druid adept, choose *three*
of the following benefits:

-   Your AC in light armor is 12 instead of 10 like most other druids.

-   You don't take opportunity attacks from enemies engaged with you
    when you cast ranged druid spells.

-   Your base hit points are 7 + CON mod instead of 6 + CON mod.

-   You can use one-handed 1d8 martial weapons without taking the --2
    attack penalty that other druids suffer.

-   You can use a shield (in human form) without taking an attack
    penalty like other druids.

Like the fighter class, you gain access to flexible attacks when you
make basic melee attacks during your turn. Roll your attack, then choose
one of the flexible attacks you know that can be triggered by your
natural attack roll. Unlike the fighter, you can usually use each of
your flexible attacks only once per battle.

If you're also a Shifter initiate, you can use your Warrior Druid
flexible attacks while in beast form, *but only* with your first beast
form attack roll each turn. Adepts can use them freely.

##### Adventurer Feat

Choose another Warrior Druid benefit you weren't able to start with.
Whether you're an initiate or an adept, you can take this feat twice to
gain the two Warrior Druid benefits you are missing.

#### Wild Healer

The Wild Healer talent provides you spell options as indicated on your
level progression chart, with possible bonus spells provided by feats.

per-battle and daily use, and gain more uses as you level up. Wild
Healer initiates and adepts get access to the *wild heal* spell later in
their career. G*reater regeneration* is only available to adepts.

The feats below are available to Wild Healer initiates and adepts.

##### Adventurer Feat

If you're a Wild Healer initiate, you gain a daily use of the *wild
heal* spell. If you're a Wild Healer adept, you instead gain a
once-per-battle use of the *wild heal* spell.

##### Champion Feat

You gain an additional daily use of *regeneration*.

##### Epic Feat

Once per day as a free action when a target of one of your
*regeneration* spells (or *greater regeneration*) fails the save to
continue its regeneration, the target succeeds instead.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### Regeneration

Close-quarters spell

**Special:** See level progression chart for usage per battle/day.

Interrupt action or quick action

**Target:** One nearby ally (with an interrupt action); or you (with a
quick action)

**Trigger (for targeted ally):** One of your allies starts its turn

**Effect:** The target heals using a recovery, rolling recovery dice as
normal, but heals only half (rounding down) the amount of healing
rolled.

At the start of the target's *next* turn, the target heals using a free
recovery, but heals only half (rounding down) the amount rolled---the
first recovery spent continues to fuel the *regeneration* effect. After
the target heals this second time, it rolls a normal save to see if the
*regeneration* spell will continue.

If the save fails, the *regeneration* spell ends.

If the save succeeds, the *regeneration* spell continues and the target
will heal using a free recovery for half hit points again at the start
of its next turn, and then roll another save to see if the
*regeneration* continues, and so on.

*Special:* The save to continue the *regeneration* effect becomes a hard
save (16+) if the target is at maximum hit points or if the target has
dropped to 0 hit points or below while the *regeneration* is in effect.

**Special:** You can only have one *regeneration* or *greater
regeneration* spell on you at a time. A second spell cast on you cancels
the first.

##### Greater Regeneration

Close-quarters spell

**Special:** See level progression chart for usage per battle/day.

Interrupt action or quick action

**Target:** One nearby ally (with an interrupt action); or you (with a
quick action)

**Trigger (for targeted ally):** One of your allies starts its turn

**Effect:** The target heals using two recoveries but only rolls
recovery dice as if it had used a single recovery.

At the start of the target's *next* turn, the target heals using a free
recovery---the two recoveries spent continue to fuel the *greater*
*regeneration* effect. After the target heals this second time, it rolls
a normal save to see if the *greater regeneration* spell will continue.

If the save fails, the *greater regeneration* spell ends.

If the save succeeds, the *greater regeneration* spell continues and the
target will heal using a free recovery again at the start of its next
turn, and then roll another save to see if the *regeneration* continues,
and so on.

*Special:* The save to continue the *regeneration* effect becomes a hard
save (16+) if the target is at maximum hit points or if the target has
dropped to 0 hit points or below while the *greater* *regeneration* is
in effect.

**Special:** You can only have one *regeneration* or *greater
regeneration* spell on you at a time. A second spell cast on you cancels
the first.

##### Wild Heal

Close-quarters spell

Daily, see level progression chart for number of uses

Quick action

**Target:** You or one nearby ally, and one randomly chosen nearby ally
that has taken damage

**Effect:** Each target heals using one of its recoveries.

### Animal Companion Rules

You have a devoted animal companion who fights alongside you like a
member of your adventuring party.

If you have a single talent invested into Animal Companion, you are an
Animal Companion initiate. If you invested two talents into Animal
Companion, you are an Animal Companion adept.

These are the same rules as for the ranger.

#### Calling to Battle

When you roll initiative, you may choose whether you want your animal
companion to take part in the battle. You may also call your animal
companion during the battle with a quick action.

Animal Companion initiates may only call their animal companion once
every other battle. The animal companion may not fight in two battles in
a row---even between full heal-ups, adventures, or gaining new levels.
Animal Companion adepts don't have this limitation; their animal
companion can fight in every battle if the adept so chooses.

#### Recoveries

As an initiate, add a recovery to your total recoveries. As an adept,
add two recoveries to your total recoveries. You can use a recovery on
yourself or your animal companion.

#### Actions

Your animal companion acts on your initiative turn, either immediately
before or after you, depending on the animal type.

Your animal companion moves gets a move action and a standard action,
but not a quick action.

If you have powers that care about the "first time you attack an enemy,"
an attack by your animal companion counts as your attack.

#### Animal Harm

Your animal companion can be healed like an ally. If it gets healed
without you being healed, it uses one of your recoveries. When you use a
recovery while next to your animal companion (including being engaged
with the same enemy), your animal companion is also healed using a free
recovery.

Instead of dying like a monster or NPC at 0 hp, your animal companion
follows PC rules for falling unconscious at 0 hp and dying after four
failed death saves or when its negative hit points equal half its normal
hit points. If your animal companion dies, it's gone for the battle,
though you can call it (or another one) to fight in the next battle (as
an adept) or the in the battle after that (as an initiate). That animal
companion will be one level lower than an animal companion would
normally be, i.e. two levels below you. At the start of the next battle,
bump the animal companion up to its proper level, i.e. one below you.

#### Stats & Levels

Each animal companion has roughly the same base stats as listed below.

Your animal companion is always one level lower than you. As a 1^st^
level druid, you'll have a level 0 animal companion. Once you gain a
level, your animal companion rises to 1^st^ level.

On top of the base stats, each type of animal has a zoologically
appropriate power or advantage.

#### Companion Bonuses

Each type of animal companion is a little different.

##### Bear (also Giant Badger, Wolverine)

**Acts:** After druid

**Advantage:** The bear gains temporary hit points equal to its level
each time it hits with an attack.

##### Champion Feat

The temporary hit points increase to double its level.

##### Boar (also Spiky Lizard)

**Acts:** Before druid

**Advantage:** The boar gains a +1 attack bonus when it moves before its
attack during the same turn.

##### Eagle (also Falcon, Hawk, Owl, Vulture)

**Acts:** Before druid

**Advantage:** It flies! Its melee damage die is dropped by one size (d6
at level 0).

##### Panther (also Lion, Tiger)

**Acts:** Before druid

**Advantage:** The panther's crit range expands by 2 against enemies
with lower initiative.

##### Snake (also Giant Spider, Poison Toad)

**Acts:** After druid

**Advantage:** The snake also deals ongoing poison damage equal to twice
your level on a natural attack roll of 18+.

##### Champion Feat

The ongoing damage is three times your level instead.

##### Epic Feat

The ongoing damage is four times your level instead.

##### Wolf (also Big Dog, Coyote, Hyena, Jackal)

**Acts:** After druid

**Advantage:** The wolf gains a +1 attack bonus against enemies its
master attacked the same turn, or against enemies engaged with its
master.

#### Baseline Stats

Use the following stats as the baseline for your animal companion.
Remember that your companion stays a level lower than you. Generally
your companion's Physical Defense should be higher than its Mental
Defense, but you could flip that if you have a good explanation.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Animal Companion Feats

Druid animal companion feats are designed so that they do not build on
each other. Unlike other feats, you don't have to take animal companion
feats progressively, one after the other as long as you qualify for the
correct tier.

##### Adventurer Feats

-   Once per day, your animal companion can attack twice in a round with
    a standard action.

-   Once per battle, your animal companion can turn a disengage success
    by an enemy it is engaged with into a failure.

-   Once per day, reroll one of your animal companion's missed attack
    rolls.

-   Your animal companion adds the escalation die to its attacks.

##### Champion Feats

-   Once per day, your animal companion can force an enemy to reroll an
    attack that hit it.

-   Your Lethal Hunter talent also applies to your animal companion.

-   Increase your animal companion's Physical Defense and Mental Defense
    by +1.

##### Epic Feats

-   Increase your animal companion's damage die by one size (for
    example, from d6s to d8s, or d8s to d10s).

-   Increase your animal companion's AC by +1.

#### Animal Companion Spells

As an Animal Companion adept, you gain a number of spells to help your
animal companion---or another's---fight better. You don't have to choose
the spells you know ahead of time. You can cast any spell of your level
or lower, limited only by the number of daily spells you get. Once you
cast a particular daily spell, no matter its level, you can't cast it
again until you take your next full heal-up.

Animal Companion spells are not available to Animal Companion initiates.

Ranged spell

Quick action to cast

**Effect:** Until the end of the battle, when the target hits with a
melee attack, you heal hit points equal to 1d10 + your Wisdom modifier.

> 9^th^ level spell: You now heal hit points equal to 2d10 + double your

#### 9^th^ Level Spells

##### Spirit Guardian 

Ranged spell

Free action to cast

Daily

**Special Trigger:** You drop to 0 hp or below while your animal
companion is nearby and still above 0 hp.

**Effect:** Your spirit trades places with the spirit of your animal
companion. You now occupy the body of your animal companion, using its
current hit points, defenses, and attacks (and the effects of any spells
cast upon it earlier).

You can't cast spells or use your normal humanoid powers and class
features while in your companion's body. You can either keep fighting as
your animal companion or you can roll a normal save as a quick action
once during each of your turns; if you succeed, your body and your
animal companion\'s body swap places while your spirits return to their
proper bodies. You keep the hit points of the animal companion before
you rolled the save, but can heal using a recovery when the swap is
complete, if you wish. Returning to your own partially-healed body
thanks to the successful save ends the spell\'s effect.

While your animal companion is in your body, it can roll death saves and
be healed. If it becomes conscious it can attack using its basic melee
attacks, but it doesn't have access to any of your spells or powers. Any
failed death saves remain with the spirit that failed them, not the
body.

(M): Indicates columns in which multiclass characters lag one level
behind.

Fighter weapon attack maneuvers deal damage based on the fighter's
level. You also don't have to keep track of upgrading a 1^st^ level
maneuver into a 3^rd^ level maneuver, because all the maneuvers function
at your level. You can change which maneuvers you know and have ready
whenever you gain a level.

At-Will

### Class Features

Fighters have two class features: Extra Tough and Threatening.

#### Extra Tough

You start with nine recoveries instead of the usual eight.

##### Adventurer Feat

Increase your total recoveries by 1.

#### Threatening

Whenever an enemy attempts to disengage from you, it takes a penalty to
its check equal to your Dexterity or Constitution modifier, whichever is
higher.

The penalty doesn't apply if you are stunned, grabbed, or otherwise
incapable of making an opportunity attack.

##### Adventurer Feat

Whenever an enemy fails to disengage from you, you also deal damage to
that enemy equal to your Dexterity or Constitution modifier. At 5^th^
level, damage is double the modifier. At 8^th^ level, it's triple.

##### Champion Feat

Whenever a non-mook enemy fails to disengage from you, it's vulnerable
to your attacks for the rest of the battle.

### Class Talents

Choose three of the following class talents.

You get an additional fighter class talent at 6^th^ level.

Fighters have flexible attacks called maneuvers; you roll your attack
and then choose which maneuver you want the attack to use. You only get
to use one maneuver with each attack, so it's usually best to choose
maneuvers with a few different triggering rolls

#### Cleave

Once per battle, make a fighter melee attack as a free action after one
of your melee attacks drops an enemy to 0 hp.

##### Adventurer Feat

If you have your move action available, you can use it before making
your Cleave attack to reach an enemy you are not already engaged with.

##### Champion Feat

You can use Cleave twice each battle, but only once a round.

##### Epic Feat

You gain a +4 attack bonus with your Cleave attacks.

#### Comeback Strike

Once per battle as a free action, make another attack with a --2 penalty
after your first fighter attack during your turn misses.

##### Adventurer Feat

You no longer take the --2 penalty to your Comeback Strike attacks.

##### Champion Feat

Once per day, you can use Comeback Strike twice in a battle.

##### Epic Feat

You gain a +4 attack bonus with your Comeback Strike attacks.

#### Counter-Attack

Once per round when the escalation die is even and an enemy misses you
with a natural odd melee attack roll, you can make a basic melee attack
dealing half damage against that enemy as a free action. (The attack
can't use any limited abilities or flexible attack maneuvers.)

##### Adventurer Feat

Your Counter-Attack attack now deals full damage.

##### Champion Feat

You can use Counter-Attack once per turn instead of once per round (in
effect, you're free to Counter-Attack once per enemy turn).

##### Epic Feat

You can now use Counter-Attack when the escalation die is 3+.

#### Deadeye Archer

Your attacks with d8 ranged weapons (heavy crossbow, longbow) now deal
d10 damage per level. Your attacks with d6 ranged weapons (light
crossbow, shortbow) now deal d8 damage per level. In addition, your
misses with basic ranged attacks deal damage equal to your level.

##### Adventurer Feat

If you spend a quick action to aim before making a ranged basic attack,
add your Dexterity modifier to the damage if you miss.

##### Champion Feat

Once per battle, expand your crit range with a fighter ranged attack by
4 (usually to 16+) for that attack. Declare you're using this feat power
before you roll the attack.

##### Epic Feat

Your crit range with ranged weapon attacks expands by 1 (usually to
19+).

#### Heavy Warrior

Once per battle while wearing heavy armor, when you are hit by an attack
that targets AC, as a free action, you can take half damage from that
attack instead.

##### Adventurer Feat

Once per day, you can use Heavy Warrior twice in a battle (against
different attacks).

##### Champion Feat

You can also use the power against an attack that targets PD.

##### Epic Feat

Once per day, you can reroll a recharge roll for a magic armor power.

#### Power Attack

Once per battle before you roll an attack, you can declare you're using
Power Attack to deal additional damage with that attack roll. If the
attack hits, you deal the following additional damage:

Deal 1d4 additional damage per level if you are using a one-handed
weapon.

Deal 1d6 additional damage per level if you are using a two-handed
weapon.

##### Adventurer Feat

You deal the additional Power Attack damage even if the attack misses.

##### Champion Feat

One battle per day, you can use Power Attack twice in the battle.

##### Epic Feat

One-handed weapon damage using Power Attack increases to 1d6 per level;
two-handed weapon damage using Power Attack increases to 1d8 per level.

#### Skilled Intercept

Once per round as a free action, roll a normal save (11+) to intercept
an enemy who is moving to attack one of your nearby allies. You can pop
free from one enemy to move and intercept the attack. If you are engaged
with more than one enemy, the others can take opportunity attacks
against you.

The moving enemy makes its attack with you as a target instead. If
you're wearing heavy armor and the attack hits, you only take half
damage.

##### Adventurer Feat

You can pop free from up to two enemies when using Skilled Intercept.

##### Champion Feat

You gain a bonus to your Skilled Intercept save equal to the escalation
die.

##### Epic Feat

Enemies can't make opportunity attacks against you during your Skilled
Intercept movement.

#### Tough as Iron

Once per battle, you can rally using a quick action instead of a
standard action.

##### Adventurer Feat

Once per day, you can rally twice during a battle as a quick action,
without needing to roll a save for the second rally.

##### Champion Feat

Increase your total number of recoveries by 2.

##### Epic Feat

When you roll a natural 20 with an attack, you gain an additional use of
Tough As Iron this battle.

### Class Features

All monks have attacks dealing JAB, PUNCH, and KICK damage, use forms as
the basis of their actions during each round, use ki points, and are
considered to fight with two-weapons even when they're just fighting
with their fists and feet. They also can take advantage of magical
bracers.

#### JAB, PUNCH, and KICK Attacks

Under normal circumstances, melee weapons that are traditional in a
monk's style function like special effects for monks. Most monk attacks
are rated as JAB, PUNCH, or KICK attacks, in the same sense that most
fighter attacks are WEAPON attacks.

-   JAB attacks deal 1d6 damage per level.

-   PUNCH attacks deal 1d8 damage per level.

-   KICK attacks deal 1d10 damage per level.

Monks don't use weapon damage dice unless they are using a
non-traditional weapon or a basic ranged attack that is not part of one
of their monk forms.

When fighting barehanded, with bracers, or with traditional monk
weapons, monks use damage dice based on the form they are attacking
with, or PUNCH damage for basic melee attacks. While using a magic
weapon, monks add the weapon's attack and damage bonus to their attacks,
and they can use that weapon's power(s).

All monk attacks that use Dexterity as the attack stat use Strength as
the ability score that determines damage.

#### Forms

When you learn a monk form, you learn all three elements of that form:
an **opening attack**, **flow attack**, and **finishing attack**. Each
element generally requires a standard action to use.

Your first standard action attack in a battle must be an opening. Your
second attack can be a flow attack from any form you know, or it can be
another opening. After you use a flow attack, your next monk attack must
be a finishing attack from any form you know, or it can be another
opening. (You can't use flow attack twice in a row.) After a finishing
attack you must start over with an opening on your next standard action.
If you do not attack one turn, you must start over with an opening on
your next standard action. This form progression applies whether you hit
or miss with your attack.

As long as you use the proper element of the form (opening, flow, or
finishing attack), you can use an opening, flow, or finishing attack
from ANY of the forms you know.

When you use an element of a form, you gain an AC bonus until the start
of your next turn. After using an opening attack you gain a +1 bonus to
AC. After using a flow attack, you gain a +2 bonus to AC. After using a
finishing attack, you gain a +3 bonus to AC. If *elven grace* or some
other power lets you use multiple elements of your forms in a turn, the
AC bonuses don't stack but you do get to use the highest bonus.

#### Ki

You gain a number of *ki* points each day equal to 1 + your Wisdom
modifier. You can spend ki to modify the natural result of one of your
attack rolls. Ki is a daily resource. When you take a full heal-up, you
regain all your ki points. You don't regain ki during a quick rest.

After rolling an attack, you can spend 1 point of ki as a free action to
change your attack's *natural* result by 1, unless that result is a
natural 1. The change can be +1 or -1. Spending ki is a free action, but
you can only spend 1 point of ki each turn.

##### Adventurer Feat

You gain 1 additional point of ki each day.

##### Champion Feat

You can spend as much ki as you like during a turn. You must spend each
point of ki on a different attack roll or a different ki power.

##### Epic Feat

Work with your GM to invent a new ki power related to your one unique
thing or some other aspect of your character's story. If the ki power is
too good and overshadows your other ki powers, the GM should rule that
you can only use it once a day.

#### Two-Weapon Fighting

Since monks are trained to strike with all their limbs, they can always
be considered to be fighting with two weapons in melee, even when
they're barehanded. The principal advantage of "two-weapon fighting" is
that you get to reroll your attack when you roll a natural 2 with a
melee attack, sticking with the reroll.

#### Bracers as Magic Items

Monks get magic-weapon style powers from magical bracers. In practice, a
monk fighting barehanded looks to bracers for magical advantage. A monk
who fights with the monastery's traditional weapons might use bracers or
a magical weapon, but a monk wearing magical bracers can't use a magical
melee weapon at the same time.

### Adventure Tier Talents

Choose three of the following adventurer-tier class talents. You get an
additional monk class talent at 6^th^ level and 9^th^ level.

You are free to take as many of the Seven Deadly Secrets talents as you
wish (up to the class limit) but you can only use one of them per
battle. You can choose which one just before using it.

#### Flurry (Seven Deadly Secrets)

*If you use* Flurry *in a battle, you can't use any other* Deadly
Secrets *talents that battle.*

You gain the following attack:

Melee attack

At-Will (once per round), when the escalation die is 3+

Quick action

**Target:** One enemy

**Attack:** Dexterity + Level vs. AC

**Hit:** JAB + Strength damage

**Miss:** ---

##### Adventurer Feat

You can now use Flurry when the escalation die is 2+.

##### Champion Feat

Your Flurry attack now deals damage equal to your level on a miss.

##### Epic Feat

When the escalation die is 4+, your Flurry attack deals PUNCH + Strength
damage instead of JAB + Strength.

##### Ki Power

*(A Thousand Palms)*: You must be engaged with 2 or more enemies to use
this power. After making a Flurry attack, you can spend 1 point of ki to
make another Flurry attack against a target you have not already
attacked with Flurry this turn.

#### Greeting Fist (Seven Deadly Secrets)

*If you use* Greeting Fist *in a battle, you can't use any other* Seven
Deadly Secrets *talent that battle.*

The first time you make a melee attack against each enemy during a
battle (including the first mook of a mob), the target takes 1d8 extra
damage on a hit.

> 2^nd^ level monk: 2d6 extra damage.
>
> 4^th^ level monk: 2d8 extra damage.
>
> 6^th^ level monk: 4d6 extra damage.
>
> 8^th^ level monk: 4d10 extra damage.
>
> 10^th^ level monk: 6d12 extra damage.

##### *Adventurer Feat*

Once per battle when you miss with your first melee attack against an
enemy, you can use Greeting Fist against that enemy later that battle.

##### *Champion Feat*

When you successfully disengage from an enemy, that enemy takes damage
equal to your level. Popping free doesn't count; the damage only applies
when you use the disengage action. (This damage doesn't count as an
attack, so if you hadn't attacked that enemy yet, you could still use
Greeting Fist on it later.)

##### *Epic Feat*

Once per battle, reroll an attack that qualified for Greeting Fist
damage.

##### Ki Power

*(Opening the Death Gate)*: When you deal Greeting Fist damage, you can
spend 1 point of ki to double that damage (as usual, a crit would then
triple that damage).

#### Temple Weapon Master (Seven Deadly Secrets)

*If you use* Temple Weapon Master *in a battle, you can't use any other*
Seven Deadly Secrets *talents that battle.*

Once per battle while you're fighting with a weapon or weapons
associated with your monastic tradition, you can turn a natural even
miss into a hit.

##### Ki Power

(*Supreme Warrior Discipline)*: When you use your Temple Weapon Master
power, you can spend 1 point of ki to gain a bonus to AC equal to the
*current* escalation die until an attack against AC misses you or until
the end of the battle. (The AC bonus increases or decreases as the
escalation die increases or decreases.)

###### *Adventurer Feat*

The AC bonus from the ki power also applies to your PD. An attack
against your PD that misses also ends the bonus.

###### *Champion Feat*

When you roll a natural 2 with a monk attack while fighting with your
monastic weapons, in addition to the reroll you get from Two-Weapon
Fighting, you gain a bonus to the rerolled attack equal to your Strength
modifier or your Wisdom modifier.

###### *Epic Feat*

One battle per day, the damage dice of your finishing attacks increase
by one size (max d12). (For example, d10s become d12s.)

#### Diamond Focus

You gain a +2 bonus to saves while you're not staggered.

In addition, you can go one round without using a monk attack form and
still maintain your place in the attack form progression. For example,
if you made an opening attack last round but don't attack this round (or
with your next standard action) for any reason, even being stunned or
unconscious, you can still use a flow attack with your next standard
action.

##### Ki Power

*(Diamond Soul)*: When you are dazed, weakened, or stunned, you can
spend 1 point of ki to make an immediate normal save (11+). If you
succeed, the effect ends. If you fail, the condition affects you
normally. (This power also works on effects that aren't save ends. It
also breaks the stunned rule by letting you use a free action to spend
ki.)

###### Adventurer Feat

You can also use the ki power to save when you're confused or hampered.

###### Champion Feat

The ki power save is now an easy save (6+).

###### Epic Feat

You can also use the ki power to save against a last gasp effect (but it
doesn't count against your total if you fail).

#### Heaven's Arrow

Unlike other monks, you have no attack penalty with ranged weapons,
including thrown weapons, longbows, shortbows, and crossbows. Your basic
ranged attacks also deal miss damage equal to your level.

Once per battle when you would make a melee attack as an element of one
of your monk forms, you can use a ranged attack against a nearby enemy
instead. This attack deals damage according to the JAB/PUNCH/KICK
hierarchy that's part of the form rather than WEAPON damage like basic
attacks.

##### Ki Power

(*Wind from Heaven*): You can spend 1 point of ki to regain your
Heaven's Arrow power when it's expended.

###### Adventurer Feat

You can now target enemies that are faraway when you use the Heaven's
Arrow power. The ranged weapon you're using might have an attack penalty
against faraway enemies, but your attack otherwise functions as normal.

###### Champion Feat

You can now use the Heaven's Arrow power twice per battle.

###### Epic Feat

You no longer take opportunity attacks when you make ranged attacks
while engaged.

#### Leaf on Wind

Once per battle when you use a move action, you can take another move
action as a free action.

In addition, if you fall with a wall, tree, or other physical object
next to you, you can fall up to 30 feet per level without taking damage.
(You slap the surface, catch handholds, and use other maneuvers to slow
your descent.)

##### Ki Power

*(Wind's Comrade)*: You can spend 1 point of ki during your turn to gain
*flight* until the end of your turn.

###### Adventurer Feat

You gain a +3 bonus to disengage checks.

###### Champion Feat

When an enemy makes an attack against you that targets more than one
creature, you only take half damage from that attack, hit or miss.

###### Epic Feat

Roll a normal save at the end of any turn in which you use the ki power.
If you succeed, your *flight* lasts until the end of your next turn.
(It's not advisable to count on this working by staying in midair,
though you could of course fly next to a wall, counting on your ability
to slow your fall as outlined above!)

#### Overworld Lineage, aka Phoenix-touched

If you wish, any time an element of the monk class refers to Wisdom, you
can replace that element with a reference to Charisma.

In addition, while you're staggered, when you roll a natural even attack
roll, you heal damage equal to your Strength modifier or your Wisdom
modifier (double that modifier at 5^th^ level; triple it at 8^th^
level).

##### Ki Power

(*Imperial Phoenix Flare*): Once per day when you are staggered, you can
spend 1 point of ki to heal using a recovery. You heal half the hit
points you roll for the recovery, and one enemy engaged with you of your
choice takes the other half in fire damage.

###### Adventurer Feat

You can now use this ki power twice per day.

###### Champion Feat

Once per day after rolling a death save, you can gain +4 bonus to the
roll.

###### Epic Feat

The first time you die after taking this feat, you are resurrected at a
place of power like your home monastery or other sanctum between one and
four days later, assuming another resurrection doesn't find you first.
(This counts against your normal resurrection limit, as normal.)

#### Spinning Willow Style

When a ranged attack or close-quarters attack that targets AC hits you,
you can roll a normal save. If you succeed, you take only half damage
from the attack.

##### Adventurer Feat

You can now use Spinning Willow Style to save against ranged attacks and
close-quarter attacks that target PD.

##### Champion Feat

If you roll a natural 18+ on the save, you instead take no damage from
the attack and can choose one nearby enemy. It takes one-quarter of the
damage as you deflect the attack.

##### Epic Feat

Spinning Willow Style saves are now easy saves (6+).

##### Ki Power

(*The Willow Bends)*: You can spend 1 point of ki to turn a failed
Spinning Willow Style save into a success.

### Champion Tier Talents

At 6^th^ level, you gain an additional monk class talent. You can choose
to take another adventurer-tier talent, or select from the talents that
follow.

#### Disciple of the Hidden Flame

When you gain this talent, choose a class: cleric, sorcerer, or wizard.
Each time you take a full heal-up, choose a non-feature spell of your
level or lower from that class. You can't choose the same spell twice in
a row; you must choose a different option each time you take a full
heal-up.

If the spell is at-will, you can cast it in place of a flow attack. If
the spell is limited use, you can cast it in place of a finishing
attacks. Use your Wisdom as the ability score that determines attack and
damage with the spell.

##### Ki Power

(*Gather the Flame)*: You can spend 1 point of ki when you cast your
Disciple of the Hidden Flame spell to cast it as if you possessed the
adventurer-tier and champion-tier feat for that spell, if any. At 8^th^
level, treat the spell like you possessed the epic-tier feat for it, if
any, when you spend the ki.

#### Improbable Stunt

Once per battle as a quick action, you can pull off an outrageous
improvisational stunt that no one else could manage, with the possible
exception of a swashbuckling rogue! The stunt is not itself an attack
but it might lead to one.

The outrageous action of your stunt isn't something you have to roll
for, even if it would ordinarily require a skill check to pull off,
though you'll still have to roll for an attack that follows up your
stunt.

##### Ki Power

(*Ludicrous Improbability Maneuver)*: You can spend 1 ki point to use
Improbable Stunt again this battle.

#### Path of the Perfect Warrior

One battle per day, you can increase your JAB damage dice to d8s, your
PUNCH damage dice to d10s, and your KICK damage dice to d12s.

##### Ki Power

(*Perfect Breath)*: Once per day when you are healing using a recovery,
you can spend 1 point of ki to heal using a second recovery as well. The
second recovery is a free.

### Epic Tier Talents

At 9^th^ level, you gain an additional monk class talent. As usual, you
can choose a talent from a lower tier, or an epic tier. Epic-tier
talents have feats but no associated ki powers.

#### Abundant Step

Once per battle when the escalation die is 1+, you can teleport to a
nearby location you can see as a move action.

##### Epic Feat

You can now teleport to a faraway location you can see.

#### Champion of Three Worlds

When you make a finishing attack, roll an additional d20 (usually two)
for the attack roll. Use the result of your choice.

##### Epic Feat

Once per battle when you make a flow attack, you can roll an additional
d20 for the attack roll.

#### Procession of the Sun and Moon

Once per level, while meditating during a quick rest, you can decide
that it's time for the start of a new day. You and each of your willing
allies can make a hard save (16+). Each character who succeeds regains
all spells, powers, hit points, ki, and recoveries as if they had taken
a full heal-up and started a new day.

The only character element that does not reset as if it was a new day
are your icon relationship rolls and any icon relationships.

##### Epic Feat

You and each of your allies gain a bonus to the save equal to your
Strength modifier or your Wisdom modifier.

## Necromancer

### Ability Scores

### Class Features

All necromancers share the following class features.

#### Arcane Implements

As a character casting arcane magic, your best options for improving
your spellcasting are wands and staffs.

#### Death's Master

All necromancers must spend at least one relationship point with any
necromantic icon. (This may be conflicted or negative.) If your one
unique thing somehow suggests that you might be free of this
requirement, make a case to your GM that this is a way in which you are
unique.

#### Ritual Magic

Necromancers can cast their spells as rituals (see Running the Game,
Rituals).

#### Spell Choices

Like other standard spellcasters, you choose the spells you will be able
to cast after each full heal-up.

#### Summoning

Your summoning spells use the standard summoning rules. The following
feats enable you to improve your summoning powers.

##### Adventurer Feat

Your summoned creatures can add the escalation die to their attacks.

##### Champion Feat

When you summon mooks, increase the number of mooks you summon by 1.

##### Epic Feat

The first time one of your non-mook summoned creatures is dropped each
battle, roll a normal save. If you succeed, the summoned creature is not
slain but instead remains in the battle with 10 hp.

#### Wasting Away

Necromancers are frail, gaunt, parched, skinny, sickly, wasted,
cadaverous, dependent on unearthly substances, or partially dead. This
isn't just an aesthetic note---as a necromancer, you must subtract your
Constitution modifier from all your necromancer spell attacks if your
modifier is positive. In addition, you don't die until you fail five
death saves. Similarly, you don't succumb to last gasp save effects
until you fail the fifth save.

##### Adventurer Feat

If your Constitution modifier is negative, add +1 to your necromancer
spell attacks.

##### Champion Feat

You don't die from damage until your negative hit points equal your
maximum hit points, instead of half your maximum.

##### Epic Feat

One battle per day, you can choose to succeed with death saves on an 11+
instead of a 16+.

### Class Talents

#### Cackling Soliloquist

If you spend your move action, your quick action, *and* your standard
action casting a daily spell that ordinarily only requires a standard
action---while screaming grandiloquently, cackling maniacally, or
megalomaniacally describing the grandeur of your plans and the futility
of your enemies' resistance---the daily spell is recharge 18+ after
battle instead of daily, and you can invent a slight improvement to the
spell, especially if it's partly story-oriented, that provides an extra
benefit determined by the GM or by you (with GM approval).

##### Adventurer Feat

You gain temporary hit points equal to 1d6 + your level + Charisma
modifier when you use Cackling Soliloquist (double your Charisma
modifier at 5^th^ level; triple it at 8^th^ level).

##### Champion Feat

Your soliloquized spell is now a recharge 16+ after battle instead of
18+.

##### Epic Feat

Once per day, you can hog the spotlight when using Cackling Soliloquist.
When you do, you heal using a free recovery and steal the escalation
die, keeping it all to yourself. Until the end of your next turn, you
are the only creature---PC, NPC, or monster---that can use the
escalation die, *and* you treat the escalation die as if it were an 8.
At the end of your next turn, return the escalation die to the table,
one point higher than it was when you seized it.

#### Dead Wizard

You gain the Cantrips class feature from the wizard class. The talent
functions like the wizard's class feature with the following exceptions:

-   You can't cast *mending*.

-   Your *light* cantrip has a sickly flicker or a dark edge. Feel free
    to call it *darklight*.

##### Adventurer Feat

You can take a wizard spell in place of one of your necromancer spells
of the same level. You can change this spell for a new one you know
whenever you take a full heal-up.

##### Champion Feat

You gain a bonus wizard spell that is at least two levels below your
level***,*** in addition to the spells you can cast as a necromancer.
You can change this spell for a new one you know whenever you take a
full heal-up.

##### Epic Feat

You gain a second bonus wizard spell, but this one can be of your level
or lower. You can change this spell for a new one you know whenever you
take a full heal-up.

#### Death Priest

When you have icon relationship advantages you're waiting to use during
a session, you can interpret them as interactions/public discussions
with the spirits of the recent or ancient dead in the area, providing
information you require (and possibly, when there's a complication from
a 5 roll, also providing that information to your enemies or otherwise
getting you into some type of trouble).

***Séance:*** Similarly, once per day while you're not in battle, you
can perform a short rite (1--2 minutes) to call upon a spirit of the
dead that's related to a random icon other than a necromantic icon. The
spirit will speak to you, relaying information helpfully, or under
protest if it's related to an icon that considers you an enemy or with
which you have a negative relationship.

You can't always rely on the dead to speak the truth, or to know what
they are talking about. Whenever you use the séance power above, the GM
secretly rolls a d20 before the discussion. On a 3+, the spirit knows
what it is talking about. On a 1--2, the information is outdated,
sabotaged, or just erroneous. (Note that this roll is only used for
séances, not for spirits you talk to thanks to icon advantages mentioned
above.)

At 5^th^ level you can use séance two times per day. At 8^th^ level you
can use it three times per day.

##### Adventurer Feat

Whenever you take a full heal-up, you can choose whether you'd like to
move a single point in a relationship with a positively or negatively
aligned icon to one of the other icons. Tell a story of what has taken
place to cause the shift, unless it's already obvious from the events of
the campaign. When you shift this relationship, the new point must match
any current relationships with that icon, but it can be positive,
negative, or conflicted if it's currently the only point you have with
that icon.

##### Champion Feat

You gain a bonus cleric spell that is at least two levels below your
level, in addition to the spells you can cast as a necromancer. You can
change this spell for a new one you know whenever you take a full
heal-up. You can also substitute references to Wisdom with references to
Intelligence in the spell.

##### Epic Feat

You gain the lowest-tier feat, if any, associated with your bonus cleric
spell.

#### Deathknell

As a quick action, you can drop a nearby enemy that has 5 hp or fewer
down to 0 hp. When you drop an enemy using Deathknell, you heal 1d6 hit
points.

You can use Deathknell to drop a mook, but only if it's the last mook in
its mob and the mob has 5 hp or fewer left.

> 3^rd^ level spell: Drop an enemy with 10 hp or fewer. Heal 1d10 hit
> points.
>
> 5^th^ level spell: Drop an enemy with 15 hp or fewer. Heal 2d8 hit
> points.
>
> 7^th^ level spell: Drop an enemy with 20 hp or fewer. Heal 4d6 hit
> points.
>
> 9^th^ level spell: Drop an enemy with 25 hp or fewer. Heal 4d8 hit
> points.

##### Adventurer Feat

When you use Deathknell, one of your nearby conscious allies can gain
the healing instead of you.

##### Champion Feat

Double the healing gained from Deathknell when you drop an enemy.

##### Epic Feat

You can increase the escalation die by 1 instead of healing when you
kill a non-mook enemy with Deathknell.

#### It's Complicated

When you roll icon relationship dice, the first 6 you roll is a 5
instead.

You gain an extra necromancer spell at the highest spell level you can
normally cast (as shown under spells known on the necromancer level
progression chart). For example, you would gain an extra 3^rd^ level
spell if you're 4^th^ level, or an extra 5^th^ level spell if you're
5^th^ level.

##### Champion Feat

All 6s you roll with relationship dice count as 5s. You gain another
extra necromancer spell, but it must be at least two levels lower than
your level.

#### Redeemer

Undead you summon release holy energy bursts as they drop to 0 hp,
dealing a small amount of damage to each enemy engaged with them.

Mooks you summon deal holy damage equal to your Charisma modifier
(double your Charisma modifier at 5^th^ level; triple it at 8^th^
level).

Non-mooks you summon deal holy damage equal to your Charisma modifier x
1d4 (1d8 at 5^th^ level; 2d6 at 8^th^ level).

In story terms, you're not likely to have a positive relationship with
any necromantic icons if you take the Redeemer talent.

##### Adventurer Feat

The first time each battle an undead creature you have summoned attacks,
it gains an attack bonus equal to your Charisma modifier.

##### Champion Feat

When one of your summoned undead creatures drops to 0 hp, instead of
having it deal holy damage to engaged enemies, you can heal hit points
equal to that damage instead.

##### Epic Feat

You can memorize a single spell that summons undead twice.

#### Skeletal Minion

You have a skeleton minion the same level as you that acts as a servant,
fights alongside you in battle, and is replaced by a new skeletal minion
when it inevitably collapses or is destroyed. It is not a summoned
create; summoning rules don't ap\\ply.

Your minion acts on your initiative, taking a standard action, a move
action, and (if applicable) a quick action. You decide whether it takes
its turn before or after you.

The listed attack and damage values are for melee attacks. Your skeletal
minion can't heal. When it drops to 0 hp, it's destroyed for that
battle. When you take a quick rest, a new (or patched up) skeletal
minion will take its place.

##### Skeletal Minion Feats

Like animal companion feats, skeletal minion feats don't build on each
other. You don't have to take them in a particular order, as long as you
qualify for the tier.

###### Adventurer Feats

-   Your skeletal minion now adds the escalation die to its attack
    rolls***.***

-   When an enemy attempts to disengage from the skeletal minion, it
    takes a penalty to the check equal to the escalation die.

-   As a quick action, you can set your skeletal minion ablaze, or
    extinguish the blaze. While it's flaming, your skeleton minion's
    damage dice increase by one size, and it deals fire damage with its
    melee attacks, but it takes damage equal to your level each time its
    natural attack roll is odd.

###### Champion Feats

-   Add a damage die of the same size to your skeletal minion's damage
    rolls (for example, 3d6 becomes 4d6).

-   Add double your Charisma modifier to your skeletal minion's hit
    points. At 8^th^ level, add triple it.

-   Add a damage die of the same size to your skeletal minion's damage
    rolls (for example, 4d6 becomes 5d6, and this is cumulative with the
    champion feat).

###### Epic Feats

-   Your skeletal minion gains a +2 bonus to all defenses.

#### Sorta Dead

In some ways, you're dead already. You don't need to eat or sleep or
breathe. You can't drown in normal water/liquid, though magical gas will
still affect you.

When a spell or effect targets or applies to undead, you can decide
whether you want to count as undead for that specific effect. (For
example, you could count as undead to take advantage of a target's
vulnerability created by the *ripping claws* attack of a starving ghoul
mook you summoned via *summon undead*.)

The first time you die each level, roll a normal save, adding your
Charisma modifier. If you succeed, you heal using a free recovery
instead of dying. If you were dying because of last gasp saves, consider
yourself saved from the last gasp problem also.

##### Adventurer Feat

You gain *resist poison 16+* and *resist negative energy 16+*.

##### Champion Feat

The spells *zombie form*, *ghoul form*, *ghost form*, and *vampiric
form* all function as recharge 16+ after battle spells for you, though
you still memorize them as daily spells.

##### Epic Feat

No undead creature that is not under the direct command of a necromantic
icon can attack you unless you attack it or cast a spell against it
first.

At-Will

**Target:** The nearby enemy with the fewest hit points (you choose if
there's a tie; you also don't have to be able to see that enemy)

> 3^rd^ level spell: 4d6 damage.
>

Ranged spell

>
> 9^th^ level spell: Target with 460 hp or fewer.

##### Adventurer Feat

A miss doesn't expend the spell.

##### Champion Feat

If you wish, the target doesn't make any attacks while confused. Instead
it becomes compliant, answers short questions if possible, and follows
other suggestions that don't lead directly to damaging itself or other
creatures. Basically, while confused it becomes a slightly puzzled
friend, which may wonder why your other friends are hurting it while
it's trying to be helpful.

***Epic Feat***

The target now adds the escalation die to its attacks while confused by
this spell*.*

*Special:* Instead of taking the ongoing damage at the end of its turn,
the target can use its standard action to strike out at the skeletal
limbs or spectral arms that are flailing at it. When it does, the
ongoing damage ends and you can't use *death's gauntlet* again until the
end of your next turn.

**Miss:** Damage equal to your level.

> 3^rd^ level spell: 2d8 damage.
>
> 5^th^ level spell: 4d6 damage.
>
> 7^th^ level spell: 6d6 damage.
>
> 9^th^ level spell: 7d10 damage.

##### Adventurer Feat

When a target uses a standard action to end *death's gauntlet* ongoing
damage, it takes negative energy damage equal to your level.

##### Champion Feat

When you roll a natural even hit against a target with this spell, the
ongoing negative energy damage has a hard save (16+).

##### Epic Feat

The spell can also target MD instead of PD.

#### Summon Undead (1^st^ level+)

Ranged spell

Daily

**Effect:** You summon a mob of 1d3 + 1 crumbling skeleton mooks, as per
the summoning rules. These skeletons fight for you until the end of the
battle or until they drop to 0 hp, whichever comes first.

As you cast the spell at higher levels, the mooks you summon vary, as
shown below. The stats for each mob of mooks you can summon are also
shown below.

> 3^rd^ level spell: 1d3 + 1 putrid zombie mooks.
>
> 5^th^ level spell: 1d3 + 1 starving ghoul mooks.
>
> 7^th^ level spell: 1d3 + 1 masterless vampire spawn mooks.
>
> 9^th^ level spell: 1d3 + 1 Blackamber skeletal warrior mooks.

##### Champion Feat

You now summon 1d4 + 1 mooks when you cast this spell instead of 1d3 +
1.

##### Epic Feat

If one or more mooks summoned by the spell survive the battle, you can
keep one mook with you until the next battle. Or until someone in the
party or the world gets sick of it and slays the thing.

#### Terror

Ranged spell

Daily

**Target:** One nearby creature with 50 hp or fewer

**Attack:** Intelligence + Level vs. MD

**Hit:** The target uses all its actions during its turn to move away
from the battle, disengaging from enemies to do so (hard save ends,
16+). If it fails to disengage with all of its actions, it won't take
opportunity attacks by moving. The effect also ends when you or one of
your allies attacks the target.

**Miss:** 1d10 + Intelligence psychic damage.

> 3^rd^ level spell: Target with 70 hp or fewer, 4d6 damage on a miss.
>
> 5^th^ level spell: Target with 100 hp or fewer, 6d6 damage on a miss.
>
> 7^th^ level spell: Target with 180 hp or fewer, 6d10 damage on a miss.
>
> 9^th^ level spell: Target with 300 hp or fewer, 8d10 damage on a miss.

##### Adventurer Feat

When you miss with this spell, you regain it after the battle.

##### Champion Feat

Increase the hit point threshold of targets by 50 hp.

##### Epic Feat

The target also takes the miss damage each time it fails a save against
the effect.

#### Unholy Blast

Ranged spell

Daily

**Target:** One nearby enemy

**Attack:** Intelligence + Level vs. PD

**Hit:** 4d6 + Intelligence negative energy damage.

**First Miss:** Half damage, and make the attack again against an enemy
you haven't already targeted with *unholy blast* this turn.

**Second Miss:** Half damage, or full damage if the escalation die is 1+
and you choose to decrease it by 1.

> 3^rd^ level spell: 4d10 damage.
>
> 5^th^ level spell: 7d10 damage.
>
> 7^th^ level spell: 10d10 damage.
>
> 9^th^ level spell: 2d8 x 10 damage.

##### Adventurer Feat

The spell can now target faraway enemies.

##### Champion Feat

The spell's damage dice increase to d12s.

##### Epic Feat

The spell now targets two nearby enemies, but you can't attack the same
target twice as you work through the misses and hits.

#### Zombie Form

Ranged spell

Daily

**Special:** You can only cast this spell outside of battle; it requires
2d4 rounds to cast.

**Target:** You or one willing nearby ally

**Effect:** The target gains 30 temporary hit points that last until the
end of the next battle. Until the end of the next battle, the target
takes a --5 penalty to Charisma and Dexterity skill checks (no penalty
to attacks), to disengage checks, and to initiative rolls.

> 3^rd^ level spell: 50 temporary hit points.
>
> 5^th^ level spell: 80 temporary hit points.
>
> 7^th^ level spell: 130 temporary hit points.
>
> 9^th^ level spell: 210 temporary hit points.

### 3^rd^ Level Spells

#### The Bones Beneath

Ranged spell

Daily

**Target:** One nearby mook (and hence, its mob)

**Attack:** Intelligence + Level vs. PD

**Hit:** 4d12 + Intelligence negative energy damage, and each mook in
the mob that drops becomes a skeleton mook under your control until the
end of the battle.

**Miss:** Half damage, and each mook in the mob that drops becomes a
skeleton mook under your control until the end of the battle.

> 5^th^ level spell: 7d12 damage.
>
> 7^th^ level spell: 2d6 x 10 damage.
>
> 9^th^ level spell: 2d10 x 10 damage.

**Special:** The stats for the mooks created by each level of *the bones
beneath* appear below. The level or physical nature of the mooks is
irrelevant; the magic of the spell turns whatever creatures it's forced
to work with into skeletal mook allies with the stats below.

The new mooks take their turn immediately after your turn.

This isn't a summoning spell, so the mooks created by this spell don't
count as summoned mooks.

#### Speak with Dead

Ranged spell

Variable

*Special:* You can use this spell 1d3 times each day (roll during a full
heal-up when you take it). Each time you use the spell, you must wait
1d6 hours before casting it again.

**Target:** One corpse you are touching that has been dead less than a
day. Note that creatures that were undead for a longer period before
they were killed are not legal targets.

**Effect:** You can ask the corpse a number of yes/no questions that the
leftover fragments of personality/spirit within the corpse will attempt
to answer truthfully using the information it had when it died.\* The
magic uses the caster's knowledge of language so no translation is
needed. The first question is free. The second question requires a DC 15
necromancy skill check using Intelligence if the corpse is "friendly,"
and Charisma if the corpse is not. Increase the DC by +5 for each
subsequent question after the second. If you're using this spell during
battle, each question and answer requires a round.

*Note:* Just as with the *séance* ability of the Death Priest talent,
there's always a 10% chance that the spirit summoned is going to lie to
you for reasons best known to it and to the GM. The GM rolls a d20
secretly before the corpse provides any answers; a 3+ means the spirit
will speak truly, but a 1 or a 2 means it will lie while appearing to be
aiming for the truth.

> 5^th^ level spell: You can now cast this spell 1d4 times per day,
> targeting corpses or even just heads that have been dead up to a week.
>
> 7^th^ level spell: Questions can now be phrased to receive three-word
> answers, targeting corpses/heads that have been dead up to a month.
>
> 9^th^ level spell: Questions can now be phrased to receive one to two
> sentence answers, targeting corpses/heads or skeletal remains of
> almost any age.

#### Summon Horror (3^rd^ level+)

Ranged spell

Daily

**Effect:** You summon a ghoul, as per the summoning rules. The summoned
ghoul fights for you until the end of the battle or until it drops to 0
hp, whichever comes first.

As you cast the spell at higher levels, the creature you summon varies,
as shown below. The stats for each creature are shown below.

> 5^th^ level spell: You can now summon a wight.
>
> 7^th^ level spell: You can now summon a barrow wight.

#### Wave of Decay

Ranged spell

Daily

**Effect:** Choose a nearby enemy. It takes 2d6 negative energy damage
for each point on the escalation die. (For example, if the escalation
die is 2 when you cast the spell, you'll deal 4d6 negative energy damage
to the target.)

Until the end of the battle, as a free action at the start of each of
your turns, repeat the effect above, choosing a target and dealing
damage based on the escalation die value.

The effect ends at the end of the battle, when you drop to 0 hp, or when
your *wave of decay* damage drops an enemy to 0 hit points!

> 5^th^ level spell: 2d12 damage.
>
> 7^th^ level spell: 3d12 damage.
>
> 9^th^ level spell: 5d12 damage.

##### Champion Feat

The spell no longer ends when you drop to 0 hit points or below; instead
it ends when you fail a death save.

##### Epic Feat

The spell no longer ends when you use it to drop an enemy to 0 hit
points; it now ends when it drops a second enemy to 0 hit points.

### 5^th^ Level Spells

#### Death's Call

Ranged spell

Once per battle

Quick action to cast

**Effect:** Choose a creature you can see in the battle. If that
creature is the next creature to drop to 0 hp, you heal using a
recovery.

> 7^th^ level spell: When the creature drops, one of your nearby allies
> can heal using a recovery instead of you.
>
> 9^th^ level spell: If the chosen creature is *not* the next creature
> in the battle to drop to 0 hp, you still gain 30 temporary hit points.

##### Champion Feat

The recovery is now free.

##### Epic Feat

If your choice was wrong, you don't expend the spell and can cast it
later this battle. A second failed choice expends the spell.

#### Rotting Curse

Ranged spell

Daily

**Target:** One nearby enemy

**Attack:** Intelligence + Level vs. PD

**Hit:** 30 ongoing negative energy damage (hard save ends, 16+), and
each time the target fails the save, the ongoing negative energy damage
increases by 15

**Miss:** 15 ongoing negative energy damage (hard save ends, 16+).

> 7^th^ level spell: 50 ongoing damage on a hit, with fail
> increments/miss damage of 25.
>
> 9^th^ level spell: 80 ongoing damage on a hit, with fail
> increments/miss damage of 40.

#### Summon Wraith (5^th^ level+)

Ranged spell

Daily

**Effect:** You summon a wraith, as per the summoning rules. This wraith
fights for you until the end of the battle or until it drops to 0 hp,
whichever comes first.

As you cast the spell at higher levels, you summon multiple wraiths.
Stats for the two versions of the wraith summoned by the spell are
listed below.

> 7^th^ level spell: You can now summon two wraiths.
>
> 9^th^ level spell: You can now summon two greater wraiths.

##### Epic Feat

When you cast *summon wraith* while the escalation die is 3+, you summon
three wraiths or greater wraiths instead of two.

### Summoning Rules

These general rules also apply to the druid's Elemental Caster class
talent.

#### Standard action spells

Casting a summoning spell generally requires a standard action. The
creature(s) you summon appears next to you, though feats or powers might
enable you to summon it nearby instead.

#### Duration

A summoned creature fights for you until the end of the battle or until
it drops to 0 hit points. At 0 hp, summoned creatures are slain and
removed from the battle.

#### One summoning spell at a time

Each spellcaster can have only a single summoning spell active at a
time. If all the creatures from an earlier summoning spell have been
slain, you're free to cast another. Alternatively, you can dismiss your
own previously summoned creatures as a quick action to clear the way for
a new summoning spell.

#### Halfway there

Summoned creatures are not the same as real creatures. They're partly
real, partly magical. Their abilities don't always match the
capabilities of the creatures that the adventurers encounter *for real*.
Sometimes this is reflected in a summoned creature's attacks or
abilities. It's always reflected in a summoned creature's hit points.

#### Hit points

Each summoned creature stat block indicates its base hit points.
Starting hit points for summoned creatures are nearly always lower than
hit points for non-summoned versions of the same creature. Some class
feats might increase the hit points of summoned creatures.

#### Actions on arrival

The turn you summon a creature, that creature takes its turn immediately
after your turn in initiative order. During its turn, the summoned
creature can act like any other creature, taking a standard, move, and
quick action. The summoned creature continues to take its turn
immediately after you (even if your initiative order changes) until the
end of the battle.

#### Escalation die

As a rule, summoned creatures don't benefit from the escalation die. A
summoned creature can add the escalation die to attacks, however, if
*you use a quick action* to give it orders or magical reinforcement. The
summoned creature then gets to use the escalation die until the start of
your next turn, including for opportunity attacks and other attacks that
it gets to make during other creatures' turns.

For example, during the turn you summon the creature, you use a quick
action afterward to give it orders, allowing it to use the escalation
die bonus. At the start of your next turn, the creature no longer gets
to use the escalation die, so you'll have to use another quick action
again during that turn for the creature to keep getting the benefit.

If you've summoned a mob of mooks, a single quick action lets every
member of the mob use the escalation die.

#### Allies

Summoned creatures generally count as your allies (for roleplaying as
well as for resolving effects).

#### No recoveries, bad healing

Summoned creatures don't have recoveries. If you cast a healing spell on
a summoned creature that requires the use of a recovery, the summoned
creature heals hit points equal to your level. If you use an effect that
would heal a summoned creature without using a recovery, the summoned
creature only heals half the normal hit points of the effect. Temporary
hit points still work normally.

#### No nastier specials

Creatures you summon don't use nastier specials.

#### Spell or creature

When a summoning spell is cast, it's definitely a spell. After casting
the spell, a summoned creature is a creature.

## Occultist

There is only one occultist, and your one unique thing should account
for your knowledge and mastery of powers hidden and occluded.

### Ability Scores

The occultist gains a +2 class bonus to Intelligence or Wisdom, as long
as it isn't the same ability you increase with your +2 racial bonus.

### Backgrounds

Possible backgrounds for the occultist's singular knowledge include:
librarian of the forbidden, or wandering mystic. Perhaps the occultist
is a holy one whose secret knowledge comes from the heavens, or perhaps
she has been touched by the abyss, and her secret knowledge comes from
someplace far more sinister.

### Gear

At 1^st^ level, the occultist starts with the embroidered robes, secret
scrolls, and runic vestments that you would expect from someone with
such arcane power. He might have a small item that looks like a harmless
bauble but whose markings become more intricate and mesmerizing the
longer it's viewed. To defend himself, he has a staff or a dagger hidden
under his robe. He also has some personal possessions left over from his
earlier life.

#### Gold Pieces

The occultist may start with either 25 gp or 1d6 x 10 gp.

#### Armor

### Class Features

#### Arcane Implements

You use arcane power to alter fate. While wands and staffs are designed
for casting spells that are different from the spells you use, given a
little time you can bend such an implement to your will.

##### Epic Feat

If you find a magic weapon that isn't an arcane implement but that calls
to your soul, you can bend it to your will and use its attack and damage
bonus for spellcasting also. Any other arcane benefits you gain from the
weapon are at the GM's discretion.

#### Delayed Magical Healing

Magical healing effects heal you one round after the effect would
normally be applied. You gain the healing at the start of the turn of
whoever applied the magical healing effect, or at the start of your next
turn if you drank a healing potion or found some other way of magically
healing yourself during your last turn. This doesn't apply outside of
combat or when you rally.

##### Adventurer Feat

Your baseline hit points are 7 instead of 6.

##### Champion Feat

Once per battle when a healing effect would be applied to you, you can
roll a save (11+). If you succeed, you get the healing immediately. If
you fail, lose a hit point.

##### Epic Feat

Increase your total recoveries by 1. Once per day as a free action when
a natural attack roll of 17 or less hits you, you take only half damage
from that attack instead.

#### Focus and Spellcasting

Wielding your arcane power of reality requires two steps. First, you
take time to focus your mind. Once you have this focus, you can cast a
spell. Casting a spell generally expends your focus, though there will
be exceptions depending on the spell.

Gaining your focus requires a standard action, and it draws opportunity
attacks just like using a ranged attack does. (The "range" in this case
is "beyond this world.") You can cast most of your spells only in
response to an event, typically during an enemy's turn or an ally's
turn.

##### Adventurer Feat

When you cast a spell and retain your focus, you gain a +2 bonus to all
defenses until the start of your next turn.

##### Champion Feat

While you have your focus, when an enemy misses you with an attack, it
takes psychic damage equal to your level.

##### Epic Feat

The "retain focus" range of your occultist spells increases by 2 (for
example, 1--5 would be 1--7).

#### Rebuke

With focus, you can pummel someone with their own negative karma. In
addition to the spells you normally know based on your level, you also
know *karmic rebuke*. There are no feats associated with this spell, but
you can improve it with the Superior Rebuke talent.

*Karmic rebuke* requires a quick action instead of an interrupt action.
It's designed so you can cast it during your turn when you've retained
your focus, then use your standard action to get your focus back that
same turn.

##### Karmic Rebuke

Close-quarters spell

**At-Will**

Quick action to cast; expend focus

**Target:** One nearby enemy

**Attack:** Intelligence + Level vs. MD

**Hit:** 1d6 + Wisdom psychic damage.

> 3^rd^ level spell: 3d6 damage.
>
> 5^th^ level spell: 5d6 damage.
>
> 7^th^ level spell: 5d8 damage.
>
> 9^th^ level spell: 7d10 damage.

#### Uniqueness

You're the only occultist. Your one unique thing should address your
identity as the occultist, but you need to contribute your own personal
take on the character just like you would with a dwarf fighter or other
character class. A character's *unique* concerns story material beyond a
class description, yours included.

#### Spell Choices and Flexible Recharge

Like a standard spellcaster, you choose the spells you will be able to
cast after each full heal-up. When you successfully recharge a spell,
you can regain any spell of that spell's level, not necessarily the same
spell again. In effect, you roll to recharge that level's spell slot.

##### Adventurer Feat

Once per day, you can automatically succeed on a recharge roll that's 6+
(but not 11+ or 16+).

##### Champion Feat

Once per day when you recharge a spell (usually during a quick rest),
you can make a recharge roll for a recharge spell even if you haven't
expended that spell (allowing you to have an additional use of that
spell available).

##### Epic Feat

Once per day, you can automatically succeed on a recharge roll.

### Class Talents

Choose four of the following class talents. You get an additional
occultist class talent at 5^th^ level, and again at 8^th^ level.

#### Brain-Melting Secrets

When you hit with a spell attack that deals psychic damage, one target
of the attack can't attack you during its next turn this battle unless
you are the only nearby enemy.

##### ***Adventurer Feat***

The effect works whenever you hit an enemy with a spell, not only one
that deals psychic damage.

##### ***Champion Feat***

You are immune to the confused and dazed conditions. In addition, charm,
fear, sleep, and similar mental effects have no effect on you.

##### ***Epic Feat***

Once per battle when you deal psychic damage to an enemy, if it has 300
hp or fewer, you can also weaken it (save ends).

#### Hewer of Truth

You can use an edged melee weapon without an attack penalty. You can use
Intelligence instead of Strength for your attack rolls with that weapon,
and Wisdom instead of Strength for your damage rolls. In addition, when
you hit an enemy engaged with you with a spell, you can cause a small
amount of extra harm to that foe with your weapon. The target takes
ongoing damage equal to your melee attack miss damage.

##### ***Adventurer Feat***

Twice per day when an enemy engaged with you misses you with an attack,
you can deal ongoing damage to it equal to your Wisdom modifier + Level
as you give it a quick slice you're your weapon (double your Wisdom
modifier at 5^th^ level; triple it at 8^th^ level).

##### ***Champion Feat***

While you have your focus, you gain a +4 bonus to opportunity attacks.

##### ***Epic Feat***

Once per day when you hit an enemy with *karmic rebuke*, you can make a
basic melee attack as a free action.

#### Icon Channeler

*You cannot take this talent if you have taken the* Icon Envoy *talent.*

You have three fewer relationship dice than normal (i.e. none at
adventurer tier, one at champion tier, and two at epic tier). Instead,
when all the characters get to roll relationship dice, you get a 5 to
apply to any icon you choose. Like any other character, you can gain
relationship dice through extraordinary story events. Remember, just
because an icon is out to kill you doesn't mean you have relationship
dice with that icon. Dice represent the utility of a connection in the
story not its strength. If you encounter icons other than the standard
ones, you can probably talk the GM into letting you align your soul to
them, but expect it to cost you.

##### ***Adventurer Feat***

Choose three icons when you take this feat. Each time you apply your 5
to one of those icons, roll a d6. On a 5--6, change that 5 you're
applying to a 6.

##### ***Champion Feat***

As the adventurer feat, except that you can also choose three more icons
(six total) when you take this feat that allow you to roll the d6 when
you apply a 5 to one of them.

##### ***Epic Feat***

You now get two 5s when the other characters roll icon relationship
dice. You can roll a d6 for each 5 if you apply it to a chosen icon from
the adventurer and champion feats.

#### Icon Envoy

*You cannot take this talent if you have taken the* Icon Channeler
*talent.*

Each time the characters roll relationship dice, declare which player
will get at least a 5 with one of their icons before the rolls. The
player rolls one of their dice for that icon before the others. That
first roll counts as a 5 unless the player rolls 6. Roll all other icon
dice normally.

##### ***Adventurer Feat***

Once per level, instead of working with the icon relationships your ally
has, give an ally a 5 with an icon they don't have a relationship with.

##### ***Champion Feat***

If the first roll for the called icon is even (2, 4, 6), it counts as a
6 instead of a 5.

##### ***Epic Feat***

If the first roll for the called icon is odd (1, 3, 5), you can declare
a second player and one of their icons, and have them roll one icon die
the same way.

#### Otherworld Shadow

A shadow self haunts and lurks near you most of the time, sometimes an
actual shadow on a wall, but other times only a presence sensed just
over your shoulder. Once per day as an interrupt action, negate all
damage and effects from an enemy's attacks against you that turn as your
shadow absorbs them. Using this talent's power means you avoid damage
from a monster's multiple attacks if it has them. It also works against
multiple attacks from mooks in the same mob working on the same
initiative count, but not attacks from multiple non-mook monsters.

##### ***Adventurer Feat***

Your shadow grants you greater personal resilience: increase your total
recoveries by 1.

##### ***Champion Feat***

Once per day as a free action, you can end all ongoing damage affecting
you as you pass off the damage to your shadow.

##### ***Epic Feat***

Once per day as a free action, you gain a *fear aura* that affects each
enemy attacking you or engaged with you. The hit point threshold for the
fear effect is the standard value for a monster five levels above you.
Allies are not subject to the fear effect unless they cast a spell that
targets you or otherwise interact with you directly in some way. Even in
this case, that ally can spend a move action to be immune to your
shadow's *fear aura* for one round.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  PC Level          Fear Threshold HP (Level + 5)
  ----------------- -----------------------------------------------------
  1                 30

  2                 36

  3                 48

  4                 60

  5                 72

  6                 96

  7                 120

  8                 144

  9                 192

  10                230
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Stance of Necessity

Twice per day as a quick action, you can gain a +4 bonus to all
defenses. The protection lasts until the end of the battle and is in
effect while you do NOT have your focus. The bonus also ends when an
attack hits you while you don't have your focus.

##### Adventurer Feat

You can guard a nearby ally instead of yourself (you don't have to see
that ally). The defense bonus ends if either you or the ally is hit
while you don't have your focus.

##### Champion Feat

Your Stance of Necessity uses are now recharge 16+ instead of daily.

##### Epic Feat

When an enemy misses you with an attack while you don't have your focus,
it takes psychic damage equal to triple your Wisdom modifier + Level.

#### Superior Rebuke

The first time each round that you expend your focus to cast a spell as
an interrupt action and fail to retain your focus, roll a d20 afterward.
On an 18--20, you can also cast *karmic rebuke* as a free action, using
that roll in place of your attack roll. You can use this talent again
during a later round in the battle once you have your focus again.

##### Adventurer Feat

You can also make the *karmic rebuke* attack when the d20 roll is 2--4
(low monster MD plus an escalation die bonus often means you'll still
hit).

##### Champion Feat

You can also make a *karmic rebuke* attack as a free action when you
roll a natural 5, 10, 15, or 20 on initiative, even if you don't have
your focus.

##### Epic Feat

One battle per day as a free action, you can enhance your *karmic*
*rebuke*. When you enhance it, enemies are vulnerable (crit range
expands by 2) to your *karmic rebuke* attacks until the end of the
battle or until you score a critical hit with the attack.

#### Unwinding the Soul

When you cast a spell and roll a natural 11+ with the attack, after the
attack you can "unwind" the target as a free action, making it
vulnerable to your attacks until the end of the battle. You can unwind
only one enemy at a time, so if you choose to unwind a different enemy,
the previous foe is no longer vulnerable to your attacks.

##### Adventurer Feat

You can now unwind a second enemy, but if you unwind a third, the first
enemy is no longer vulnerable. You can also take this feat multiple
times, allowing you to unwind another enemy each time you select it.

##### Champion Feat

You can now unwind an enemy with any attack roll other than a natural 1
when you cast a spell, instead of only on an 11+.

##### Epic Feat

When you attack an enemy that you have begun to unwind and roll a
natural 11+ against it, it takes extra psychic damage equal to your
Wisdom modifier + Level from all subsequent hits by you or your allies.

#### Warp Flesh

When you cast a spell that targets Mental Defense and the target has a
higher MD than PD, the attack "twists" and targets PD instead. When a
spell twists this way, it deals force damage instead of its normal
damage type.

##### Adventurer Feat

When you cast a spell that twists, you gain temporary hit points equal
to your Wisdom modifier (double your Wisdom modifier at 5^th^ level;
triple it at 8^th^ level).

##### Champion Feat

When you score a critical hit with a spell, the target also takes
ongoing force damage equal to double your Wisdom modifier (triple it at
8^th^ level). The ongoing damage isn't doubled by the crit.

##### Epic Feat

Once per battle when you hit an enemy with a spell, you can negate all
of the target's resistances (hard save ends, 16+). This effect occurs
even if the target's PD is higher than its MD.

appearances (if you could use it before rolling initiative!), and even
icon relationship rolls.

declare that you're using a Smite Evil attack. Add +1d12 to the damage
roll AND deal half damage with the attack if it misses.

##### Adventurer Feat

Your Smite Evil attacks gain a +4 attack bonus.

##### Champion Feat

Add 2d12 to the damage roll instead of 1d12.

##### Epic Feat

Add 4d12 to the damage roll instead of 2d12.

### Class Talents

Choose three of the following class talents.

You get an additional paladin class talent at 5^th^ level, and again at
8^th^ level.

#### Bastion

You gain +1 AC.

In addition, once per battle when a nearby ally is hit by an attack, you
can choose to lose hit points equal to half of that damage, and have
your ally take only half of the damage instead. The damage you lose can
come from temporary hit points, but isn't affected by damage resistance
and other tricks to avoid the damage.

##### Adventurer Feat

Increase your total number of recoveries by 1.

##### Champion Feat

Once per day, you can use Bastion twice in the same battle.

##### Epic Feat

When you use Bastion now, your ally takes no damage. You still lose hit
points equal to half the damage.

#### Cleric Training

Choose one cleric spell of your level or lower. That spell is now part
of your powers. (You can change out the spell normally.)

##### Adventurer Feat

You can use your Charisma as the attack ability for cleric spells you
can cast.

##### Champion Feat

You can now cast the cleric class feature *heal* spell twice per day.

##### Epic Feat

Choose two cleric spells instead of one.

#### Divine Domain

**Special:** You can choose Divine Domain a second time, if you wish, at
5^th^ level or at 8^th^ level.

Choose one of the domains listed in the cleric's class talent list. You
gain all the domain's advantages, including the ability to use the
domain's invocation once per day.

If the domain you choose is designed to help cleric spells and attacks,
reinterpret the talent to help your paladin powers. You can use the
domain's feats if you wish; reinterpret them similarly if necessary.

#### Fearless

You are immune to fear abilities and to any non-damage effects of
attacks named or described as fear attacks.

In addition, you gain a +1 melee attack bonus against enemies that are
not engaged by any of your allies. The bonus increases to +2 against
enemies with fear abilities.

##### Adventurer Feat

You gain a +1 bonus to death saves.

##### Champion Feat

You gain a +1 bonus to all saves except death saves.

##### Epic Feat

Your nearby allies gain a +1 bonus to death saves.

#### Implacable

You can roll saves at the start of your turn instead of at the end of
your turn. A successful save against ongoing damage, for example, means
that you will not take the ongoing damage that turn.

##### Adventurer Feat

You gain a +1 bonus to saves.

##### Champion Feat

Once during your turn as a free action, you can choose to lose hit
points equal to your level to reroll a save.

##### Epic Feat

You gain a +1 bonus to Physical Defense and Mental Defense.

#### Lay on Hands

Twice per day as a quick action, you can heal yourself or an ally next
to you with a touch. You spend the recovery while the recipient heals as
if they had spent the recovery.

##### Adventurer Feat

Add twice your Charisma modifier to the healing provided by Lay on
Hands.

##### Champion Feat

Lay on Hands healing uses a free recovery instead of one of your own.

##### Epic Feat

You can now use Lay on Hands four times per day instead of two.

#### Paladin's Challenge

When you hit an enemy with a melee attack, you can choose to challenge
that enemy as a free action. Until the end of the battle, provided that
both you and the enemy you've challenged are conscious and capable of
making an attack, you each take a --4 attack penalty against all other
creatures and a --4 penalty to disengage checks from each other.

The attack penalty temporarily deactivates for the attacker when they
make an attack roll against their rival, but only until the end of the
attacker's turn. For example, if a creature with more than one attack
attacks you first, its subsequent attacks against your allies are
without the challenge penalty. However, the attack penalty resets at the
end of its turn, so it does not help with opportunity attacks against
your allies later in the round.

You can only have one enemy challenged at a time.

Your Paladin's Challenge ends when...

-   ...you or the creature you are challenging falls unconscious or
    drops to 0 hp.

-   ...you hit a different enemy with an attack (assuming you hit with
    the --4 penalty).

-   ...the creature flees faraway and you choose to end the challenge.

An enemy can only be the subject of one Paladin's Challenge at a time; a
new challenge overrides the previous one.

In the unlikely case in which two paladins fight each other, any use of
Paladin's Challenge locks them into a challenge that only ends when one
of them drops.

##### Adventurer Feat

The attack and disengage penalty for challenged enemies (but not for
you) is equal to --4 or to the escalation die, whichever is higher.

##### Champion Feat

You can have two challenges active at the same time against different
enemies.

##### Epic Feat

Enemies you challenge are vulnerable to your attacks.

#### Path of Universal Righteous Endeavor

**Special:** You can't take this talent if you take the Way of Evil
Bastards talent.

Your nearby allies gain a +1 bonus to all saves.

##### Adventurer Feat

Once per day, you can reroll your relationship dice with a heroic or
ambiguous icon.

##### Champion Feat

All of your melee and ranged attacks deal holy damage.

##### Epic Feat

You gain an additional relationship point with a heroic or ambiguous
icon.

#### Way of Evil Bastards

**Special:** You can't take this talent if you take the Path of
Universal Righteous Endeavor talent.

When one of your Smite Evil attacks drops a non-mook enemy to 0 hp, that
use of Smite Evil is not expended.

##### Adventurer Feat

Once per day, you can reroll your relationship dice with a villainous or
ambiguous icon.

##### Champion Feat

When one of your Smite Evil attacks drops three or more mooks, it is not
expended.

##### Epic Feat

You gain an additional relationship point with a villainous or ambiguous
icon.

### Basic Attacks

#### Melee Attack

At-Will

**Target:** One enemy

**Attack:** Strength OR Dexterity + Level vs. AC

**Hit:** WEAPON + Strength damage

**Miss:** Damage equal to your level

#### Ranged Attack

At-Will

**Target:** One enemy

**Attack:** Dexterity + Level vs. AC

**Hit:** WEAPON + Dexterity damage

**Miss:** Damage equal to your level

### Class Talents

Choose three of the following class talents, or put two talents into
Animal Companion, and one talent elsewhere.

You get an additional ranger class talent at 5^th^ level, and again at
8^th^ level.

#### Animal Companion

**Special:** Unlike most class talents, this talent can take up to two
ranger class talent slots. Spending one talent makes you an Animal
Companion initiate. Spending two makes you an Animal Companion adept.

You have a normal-sized animal companion that fights alongside you in
battle. See Animal Companion Rules.

If you would rather have a smaller beast as a pet, see the Ranger's Pet
talent.

#### Archery

Once per battle, reroll one of your missed ranged attacks.

##### Adventurer Feat

Your Archery rerolls gain a +2 attack bonus and the attack's crit range
expands by 1.

##### Champion Feat

Once per day, you can use Archery twice in the same battle.

##### Epic Feat

Once per day, you can turn a normal hit with a ranger ranged attack into
a critical hit.

#### Double Melee Attack

When fighting with two one-handed melee weapons, your default option is
to make a double melee attack.

Your weapon damage die drops one notch, usually from d8s to d6s. If your
first attack is a natural even roll (hit or miss), you can make a second
attack as a free action.

If you decide you don't want to try for a double melee attack while
fighting with two one-handed weapons, declare it before rolling your
attack; the single attack will deal the normal damage dice instead of
using reduced damage dice.

##### Adventurer Feat

Your second attack gains a +2 attack bonus if it is against a different
target.

##### Champion Feat

Once per battle, use Double Melee Attack after an odd attack roll.

##### Epic Feat

Each turn, you can pop free of one enemy before one attack roll that is
part of a Double Melee Attack. You can also use your move action in
between your two attacks if you wish.

#### Double Ranged Attack

When you attack with a ranged weapon that does not need to be reloaded,
your default option is to make a double ranged attack.

Your weapon damage die drops one notch, usually from d8s to d6s. If your
first attack is a natural even roll (hit or miss), you can make a second
attack as a free action.

If you decide you don't want to try for a double ranged attack when
firing your bow or other ranged weapon, declare it before rolling your
attack; the single attack will deal the normal damage dice instead of
using reduced damage dice.

##### Adventurer Feat

Your second attack gains a +2 attack bonus if it is against a different
target.

##### Champion Feat

Once per battle, you can use Double Ranged Attack after an odd attack
roll.

##### Epic Feat

Each turn, you can pop free of one enemy before one attack roll that is
part of a Double Ranged Attack. You can also use your move action in
between your two attacks if you wish.

#### Favored Enemy

Choose a specific monster type (e.g. aberration, beast, construct,
demon, devil, dragon, elemental, giant, humanoid\*, ooze, plant, spirit,
or undead**)**. The crit range of your ranger attacks against that type
of enemy expands by 2.

\*Choosing humanoid: Unlike other favored enemies, choosing humanoid as
your favored enemy takes up two ranger class talent slots.

##### Adventurer Feat

You can change your favored enemy by meditating when you take a full
heal-up.

##### Champion Feat

Your crit range for attacks against favored enemies expands by 1 (to
+3).

##### Epic Feat

Choose a second non-humanoid monster type as a favored enemy.

#### Fey Queen's Enchantments

Choose one daily or recharge spell of your level or lower from the
sorcerer class. You can cast this spell as if you were a sorcerer
(though you can't gather power).

##### Adventurer Feat

You can choose which ability score you want to use as the attack ability
for sorcerer spells you can cast.

##### Champion Feat

You can now choose from sorcerer at-will spells.

##### Epic Feat

You gain an additional sorcerer spell of your choice that is your level
or lower; a total of two from this talent.

#### First Strike

The first time you attack an enemy during a battle, your crit range for
that attack expands by 2 (usually to 18+). A mob of mooks counts as a
single enemy.

##### Adventurer Feat

The crit range of your First Strike attacks expands by 1 (to +3).

##### Champion Feat

Once per day, deal triple damage with a First Strike crit instead of
double damage.

##### Epic Feat

Whenever you hit with a First Strike attack, you can reroll your damage
once and use the higher roll.

#### Lethal Hunter

Once per battle as a free action, choose an enemy. The crit range of
your attacks against that enemy expands by 2 for the rest of the battle.
A mob of mooks counts as a single enemy.

##### Adventurer Feat

The crit range of your Lethal Hunter attacks expands by 1 (to +3).

##### Champion Feat

One battle per day, you can use Lethal Hunter against two different
enemies.

##### Epic Feat

Your Lethal Hunter crits deal triple damage instead of double damage
while the escalation die is 3+.

#### Ranger ex Cathedral

Choose one daily or recharge spell of your level or lower from the
cleric class. You can cast this spell as if you were a cleric. You can
change your chosen spell each time you take a full heal-up.

##### Adventurer Feat

You can cast the cleric class feature *heal* spell once per battle.

##### Champion Feat

You can now choose from cleric at-will spells.

##### Epic Feat

You gain an additional cleric spell of your choice that is your level or
lower; a total of two from this talent.

#### Ranger's Pet

You have a small animal or beast that accompanies you on your
adventures. Use the rules from the Wizard's Familiar talent with the
following differences:

1.  The creature is your pet or friend instead of your familiar.

2.  Your pet is fully natural rather than partially magical.

3.  Your pet can end up with more abilities, if you choose.

##### Adventurer Feat

Your pet gains a third ability.

##### Champion Feat

Your pet gains a fourth ability.

##### Epic Feat

Your pet gains a fifth ability.

#### Tracker

You have the Tracker background at its full possible bonus of +5,
without having to spend your normal background points on it. You are an
expert wilderness tracker, capable of reading clues from the environment
that others can't perceive. Tracking doesn't work well, however, in
heavily traveled urban environments.

In addition, you have the terrain stunt power.

**Terrain stunt:** At the start of each battle in a non-urban
environment, roll a d6. Any time after the escalation die reaches that
number, you'll be able to use a quick action to execute a terrain stunt.
Normally you can only use terrain stunt once per battle, but
circumstances, geography, or excellent planning may suggest that you can
pull it off more than once.

Terrain stunts are improvisational effects that play off your
preternatural understanding of the wilderness and all the diverse forms
of the natural world. Things like knocking a hornets nest no one had
noticed onto your enemy's head, maneuvering a foe onto a soggy patch of
ground that slows them down, shooting the cap off a mushroom spore in a
dungeon that erupts on your enemies, getting your enemy's sword wedged
into a stalactite, finding the tree branch that lets you vault up to
attack the flying demon that thought it was out of axe range, and
similar types of actions.

##### Adventurer Feat

Your grasp of the way the world is put together increases; you now can
use terrain stunt in urban environments.

##### Champion Feat

You can track as well in urban areas as you do in the wilderness.

##### Epic Feat

You can track flying creatures and creatures that normally wouldn't be
trackable, and there's the possibility that even teleports give you a
sense of direction.

#### Two-Weapon Mastery

You gain a +1 attack bonus when fighting with a one-handed melee weapon
in each hand.

##### Adventurer Feat

When you fight with two one-handed melee weapons, increase the damage
you deal with missed attacks by adding your level to it. Most of your
basic melee attacks, therefore, will deal double your level as miss
damage.

##### Champion Feat

If you fight with two one-handed melee weapons, whenever an enemy makes
a melee attack against you and rolls a natural 1, you can make an
opportunity attack against that foe as a free action.

##### Epic Feat

One battle per day, increase the damage you deal with missed attacks to
triple your level instead of double your level (from Two-Weapon
Mastery).

### Animal Companion Rules

You have a devoted animal companion who fights alongside you like a
member of your adventuring party.

If you have a single talent invested into Animal Companion, you are an
Animal Companion initiate. If you invested two talents into Animal
Companion, you are an Animal Companion adept.

These are the same rules as for the druid.

#### Calling to Battle

When you roll initiative, you may choose whether you want your animal
companion to take part in the battle. You may also call your animal
companion during the battle with a quick action.

Animal Companion initiates may only call their animal companion once
every other battle. The animal companion may not fight in two battles in
a row---even between full heal-ups, adventures, or gaining new levels.
Animal Companion adepts don't have this limitation; their animal
companion can fight in every battle if the adept so chooses.

#### Recoveries

As an initiate, add a recovery to your total recoveries. As an adept,
add two recoveries to your total recoveries. You can use a recovery on
yourself or your animal companion.

#### Actions

Your animal companion acts on your initiative turn, either immediately
before or after you, depending on the animal type.

Your animal companion moves gets a move action and a standard action,
but not a quick action.

If you have powers that care about the "first time you attack an enemy,"
an attack by your animal companion counts as your attack.

#### Animal Harm

Your animal companion can be healed like an ally. If it gets healed
without you being healed, it uses one of your recoveries. When you use a
recovery while next to your animal companion (including being engaged
with the same enemy), your animal companion is also healed using a free
recovery.

Instead of dying like a monster or NPC at 0 hp, your animal companion
follows PC rules for falling unconscious at 0 hp and dying after four
failed death saves or when its negative hit points equal half its normal
hit points. If your animal companion dies, it's gone for the battle,
though you can call it (or another one) to fight in the next battle (as
an adept) or the in the battle after that (as an initiate). That animal
companion will be one level lower than an animal companion would
normally be, i.e. two levels below you. At the start of the next battle,
bump the animal companion up to its proper level, i.e. one below you.

#### Stats & Levels

Each animal companion has roughly the same base stats as listed below.

Your animal companion is always one level lower than you. As a 1^st^
level ranger, you'll have a level 0 animal companion. Once you gain a
level, your animal companion rises to 1^st^ level.

On top of the base stats, each type of animal has a zoologically
appropriate power or advantage.

#### Companion Bonuses

Each type of animal companion is a little different.

##### Bear (also Giant Badger, Wolverine)

**Acts:** After ranger

**Advantage:** The bear gains temporary hit points equal to its level
each time it hits with an attack.

##### Champion Feat

The temporary hit points increase to double its level.

##### Boar (also Spiky Lizard)

**Acts:** Before ranger

**Advantage:** The boar gains a +1 attack bonus when it moves before its
attack during the same turn.

##### Eagle (also Falcon, Hawk, Owl, Vulture)

**Acts:** Before ranger

**Advantage:** It flies! Its melee damage die is dropped by one size (d6
at level 0).

##### Panther (also Lion, Tiger)

**Acts:** Before ranger

**Advantage:** The panther's crit range expands by 2 against enemies
with lower initiative.

##### Snake (also Giant Spider, Poison Toad)

**Acts:** After ranger

**Advantage:** The snake also deals ongoing poison damage equal to twice
your level on a natural attack roll of 18+.

##### Champion Feat

The ongoing damage is three times your level instead.

##### Epic Feat

The ongoing damage is four times your level instead.

##### Wolf (also Big Dog, Coyote, Hyena, Jackal)

**Acts:** After ranger

**Advantage:** The wolf gains a +1 attack bonus against enemies its
master attacked the same turn, or against enemies engaged with its
master.

#### Baseline Stats

Use the following stats as the baseline for your animal companion.
Remember that your companion stays a level lower than you. Generally
your companion's Physical Defense should be higher than its Mental
Defense, but you could flip that if you have a good explanation.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Animal Companion Feats

Ranger animal companion feats are designed so that they do not build on
each other. Unlike other feats, you don't have to take animal companion
feats progressively, one after the other as long as you qualify for the
correct tier.

##### Adventurer Feats

-   Once per day, your animal companion can attack twice in a round with
    a standard action.

-   Once per battle, your animal companion can turn a disengage success
    by an enemy it is engaged with into a failure.

-   Once per day, reroll one of your animal companion's missed attack
    rolls.

-   Your animal companion adds the escalation die to its attacks.

##### Champion Feats

-   Once per day, your animal companion can force an enemy to reroll an
    attack that hit it.

-   Your Lethal Hunter talent also applies to your animal companion.

-   Increase your animal companion's Physical Defense and Mental Defense
    by +1.

##### Epic Feats

-   Increase your animal companion's damage die by one size (for
    example, from d6s to d8s, or d8s to d10s).

-   Increase your animal companion's AC by +1.

#### Animal Companion Spells

As an Animal Companion adept, you gain a number of spells to help your
animal companion---or another's---fight better. You don't have to choose
the spells you know ahead of time. You can cast any spell of your level
or lower, limited only by the number of daily spells you get. Once you
cast a particular daily spell, no matter its level, you can't cast it
again until you take your next full heal-up.

Animal Companion spells are not available to Animal Companion initiates.

Ranged spell

Quick action to cast

**Effect:** Until the end of the battle, when the target hits with a
melee attack, you heal hit points equal to 1d10 + your Wisdom modifier.

> 9^th^ level spell: You now heal hit points equal to 2d10 + double your

#### 9^th^ Level Spells

##### Spirit Guardian 

Ranged spell

Free action to cast

Daily

**Special Trigger:** You drop to 0 hp or below while your animal
companion is nearby and still above 0 hp.

**Effect:** Your spirit trades places with the spirit of your animal
companion. You now occupy the body of your animal companion, using its
current hit points, defenses, and attacks (and the effects of any spells
cast upon it earlier).

You can't cast spells or use your normal humanoid powers and class
features while in your companion's body. You can either keep fighting as
your animal companion or you can roll a normal save as a quick action
once during each of your turns; if you succeed, your body and your
animal companion\'s body swap places while your spirits return to their
proper bodies. You keep the hit points of the animal companion before
you rolled the save, but can heal using a recovery when the swap is
complete, if you wish. Returning to your own partially-healed body
thanks to the successful save ends the spell\'s effect.

While your animal companion is in your body, it can roll death saves and
be healed. If it becomes conscious it can attack using its basic melee
attacks, but it doesn't have access to any of your spells or powers. Any
failed death saves remain with the spirit that failed them, not the
body.

### Class Features

All rogues fight better when they gain momentum, are good at stabbing
enemies in the back, and have a knack for avoiding the traps that their
clueless allies would stumble into.

#### Momentum

Many of the rogue's powers function only when the rogue has momentum.

You gain momentum by hitting an enemy with an attack.

You lose momentum when you are hit by an attack.

The default is that you can use momentum powers without losing momentum,
but a few powers specify that you must spend your momentum to use them.
You don't have to use attacks that require momentum against the foe you
hit to gain that momentum.

Momentum powers that do not require you to spend your momentum are
generally classified as interrupt actions. You can only use one
interrupt action a round, which keeps your momentum powers from
dominating the battle.

#### Sneak Attack

Once per round when you make a rogue melee weapon attack against an
enemy engaged with one or more of your allies, you can deal extra damage
if your attack hits.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Rogue Level                       Extra Damage
  --------------------------------- -------------------------------------
  1                                 +1d4

  2                                 +1d6

  4                                 +2d6

  6                                 +3d6

  8                                 +5d6

  10                                +7d6
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

##### Adventurer Feat

Your Sneak Attack feature also works the first round of combat against
enemies with a lower initiative than you.

##### Champion Feat

Your Sneak Attack feature also works against enemies who are confused,
dazed, stunned, vulnerable to your attack, or weakened.

##### Epic Feat

Once per battle when you miss with an attack that would have allowed you
to deal Sneak Attack damage, replace the normal miss damage with your
full Sneak Attack damage.

#### Trap Sense

Even rogues whose backgrounds don't have anything to do with noticing,
avoiding, or disarming traps have a unique knack for dealing with traps.

If a rogue's skill check involving a trap is a natural even failure, the
rogue can reroll the skill check once. If a trap's attack roll against a
rogue is a natural odd roll, the rogue can force the trap to reroll the
attack once.

##### Adventurer Feat

The trap attack reroll can also apply to a nearby ally of the rogue as
the rogue shouts a warning or acts to prevent the trap from hitting.

##### Champion Feat

You gain a +3 bonus to skill check rerolls you make against traps.

##### Epic Feat

You only take half damage from trap attacks.

### Class Talents

Choose three of the following class talents.

#### Cunning

You can use your Intelligence in place of your Charisma for any rogue
attacks, talents, or powers that use Charisma (e.g. *shadow walk* and
*slick feint*). You also gain two extra points of backgrounds to spend
on knowledge-related backgrounds and gain a +2 bonus to skill checks
involving traps.

##### Adventurer Feat

You gain a +1 bonus to Mental Defense.

##### Champion Feat

Once per battle, reroll a save against an effect from an attack that
originally hit your Mental Defense.

##### Epic Feat

Your once-per-battle save reroll is now once per save.

#### Improved Sneak Attack

Your Sneak Attack damage is better than other rogues. Use the following
Sneak Attack bonus damage progression instead.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Rogue Level                       Extra Damage
  --------------------------------- -------------------------------------
  1                                 +1d6

  2                                 +1d8

  4                                 +2d8

  6                                 +3d8

  8                                 +5d8

  10                                +7d8
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

##### Adventurer Feat

Once per day as a free action, you can add your Sneak Attack damage to
any hit against one target that would not otherwise have qualified for
the damage.

##### Champion Feat

Once per day, roll d20s for your Sneak Attack damage instead of d8s.

##### Epic Feat

One battle per day, ignore the limitation that you can use Sneak Attack
damage only once per round.

#### Murderous

Against staggered enemies, your crit range with rogue attacks expands by
2.

##### Adventurer Feat

You gain a +2 attack bonus against staggered enemies.

##### Champion Feat

Your crit range against staggered enemies expands by 2 (now +4).

##### Epic Feat

Whenever a staggered enemy misses you with a melee attack, it's
vulnerable to your attacks for the rest of the battle.

#### Shadow Walk

You gain the *shadow walk* at-will power:

As a move action before you have used your standard action this turn, if
you are not engaged, you can make the following "attack" against all
nearby enemies, targeting the enemy among them with the highest Mental
Defense.

**Attack:** Charisma + Level vs. MD

**Hit:** Remove yourself from play. At the start of your next turn,
return anywhere nearby that you could have moved to normally during your
turn, and deal double damage with your first rogue attack that turn.

**Miss:** No effect. You can't attempt to *shadow walk* again until your
next turn, but you still have your standard action this turn.

##### Adventurer Feat

On a miss, you can still use your move action normally (but still can't
*shadow walk* this turn).

##### Champion Feat

Twice per day, you can reroll the rogue attack that follows your
successful use of *shadow walk*.

##### Epic Feat

Twice per day, you can reappear from your *shadow walk* in a nearby
location you wouldn't have been able to reach unimpeded physically, for
instance, on the other side of a portcullis or door, or high up a wall.

#### Smooth Talk

Once per day, convince your GM with an amazing line of patter while you
are using social skills to speak or interact with NPCs associated with a
particular icon. If the GM is convinced by your patter, roll a normal
save (11+). If you succeed, for the rest of the day you can function as
if you have a 2-point positive relationship with the icon who seems to
be in play. Thanks to your amazing gift of gab, for a short time, it's
more or less true. (Note that these points replace any points you
normally have with the icon rather than adding to them.)

Failure on the Smooth Talk save generally arouses suspicions.

##### Adventurer Feat

Add your Charisma modifier to your Smooth Talk save rolls.

##### Champion Feat

Success with your Smooth Talk talent gives you a 3-point positive
relationship instead.

##### Epic Feat

Even if you fail your Smooth Talk save, you get a 2-point conflicted
relationship with the icon because the people you're speaking with can't
be sure.

#### Swashbuckle

Once per battle as a quick action, you can spend your momentum to pull
off a daring stunt the likes of which others could scarcely conceive.
You may make an attack as part of the stunt, but you'll need to roll
normally for the attack. This is an improvisational talent.

As a swashbuckler, you do not need a difficult skill check to pull the
stunt off.

#### Thievery

You have the Thief background at its full possible bonus of +5, without
having to spend your normal background points on it.

##### Adventurer Feat

Regardless of your level, you gain the bonus power *thief's strike* in
addition to your normal number of powers.

##### Champion Feat

Once per day, you can deal full damage with *thief's strike* instead of
half damage.

##### Epic Feat

Twice per level, you can steal something with a successful *thief's
strike* that you would not be able to steal ordinarily, but that would
require a bit of magic, e.g. a dream, a spell, someone's hope, a memory.
The theft probably isn't going to be permanent, but it should last at
least a day or two. You can't steal the same thing twice.

#### Tumble

You gain a +5 bonus to disengage checks. In addition, while you are
moving, if an enemy moves to intercept you, you can make one disengage
roll per intercepting enemy as a free action to avoid that enemy, but
you must stop the first time you fail any of those disengage checks.

##### Adventurer Feat

You ignore the penalty for disengaging from more than one enemy at a
time.

##### Champion Feat

One battle per day as a free action, you can declare that you're a
tumbling fool and automatically succeed on your first disengage check
each turn.

##### Epic Feat

Whenever you take critical hit damage, roll a hard save (16+). If you
succeed, you somehow tumbled out of the way of whatever was about to hit
you, and instead only take damage equal to the attacker's level.

### 1^st^ Level Powers

Evasive Strike

Melee attack

At-Will

**Target:** One enemy

**Attack:** Dexterity + Level vs. AC

**Hit:** WEAPON + Dexterity damage, and you can pop free from the
target.

**Miss:** Damage equal to your level.

##### Adventurer Feat

If you drop the target with your *evasive strike* attack, you can pop
free from all enemies instead.

##### Champion Feat

If you hit with *evasive strike* and the natural attack roll was even,
you gain a +2 bonus to AC and PD against the next attack that targets
you this battle (no joy if it's an attack vs. MD).

##### Epic Feat

Ok. Thanks to your slippery mind, the champion feat benefit also
provides a +2 bonus to MD.

#### Deadly Thrust

Melee attack

At-Will

**Target:** One staggered non-mook enemy

**Attack:** Dexterity + Strength + Level vs. AC

**Hit:** WEAPON + Dexterity damage.

**Miss:** Damage equal to your level.

##### Adventurer Feat

Add your Strength modifier to the miss damage.

##### Champion Feat

You can now target mooks with *deadly thrust*.

##### Epic Feat

If you don't add your Sneak Attack damage to the attack, you also deal
damage equal to five times your Strength modifier to your deadly thrust
target when you hit.

#### Flying Blade

Ranged attack

At-Will

**Special:** You must use a small bladed weapon with this attack.

**Target:** One nearby creature

**Attack:** Dexterity + Level vs. AC

**Hit:** WEAPON + Dexterity damage, and if your natural attack roll is
even and one of your allies is engaged with the target, you can use your
Sneak Attack damage for the round.

**Miss:** Damage equal to your level.

##### Adventurer Feat

If you score a critical hit with *flying blade*, the target is also
dazed (--4 attack) until the end of your next turn.

##### Champion Feat

As long as one of your allies is engaged with the target, your *flying
blade* attack rolls no longer need to be even to add your Sneak Attack
damage.

##### Epic Feat

You can use *flying blade* with any ranged weapon.

#### Roll With It

Momentum power

At-Will (once per round)

Interrupt action; requires momentum

Trigger: A melee attack that targets AC hits you.

**Effect:** You take half damage from that attack.

##### Adventurer Feat

The power also triggers on an attack against PD.

##### Champion Feat

The power also triggers on a ranged attack.

##### Epic Feat

Once per day, you can use roll with it to take damage equal to the
attacker's level instead of half damage.

#### Sure Cut

Melee attack

At-Will

**Special:** You must have momentum and be able to deal your Sneak
Attack damage to the target if you hit.

**Target:** One enemy

**Attack:** Dexterity + Level vs. AC

**Hit:** WEAPON + Dexterity damage.

**Miss:** Deal your Sneak Attack damage + damage equal to your level.

##### Champion Feat

Missing with *sure cut* no longer counts as a use of Sneak Attack for
the round.

#### Tumbling Strike

Melee attack

At-Will

Always: You gain a +5 bonus to all disengage checks you attempt this
turn. You can also move to engage an enemy, make this attack against it,
and then use a quick action to attempt to disengage from it (the quick
action disengage lets you move again if you succeed).

**Attack:** Dexterity + Level vs. AC

**Hit:** WEAPON + Dexterity damage.

**Miss:** Damage equal to your level.

### 3^rd^ Level Powers

#### Bleeding Strike

Melee attack

At-Will

even, the target takes ongoing damage equal to 1d4 times your level.

**Miss:** Damage equal to your level.

##### Adventurer Feat

The ongoing damage against large or huge targets increases to 1d6 times
your level.

##### Champion Feat

A natural even miss also deals ongoing damage equal to your level.

##### Epic Feat

You can now use *bleeding strike* against enemies taking ongoing damage.

#### Deflection

Momentum power

At-Will (once per round)

Interrupt action; you must spend your momentum

Trigger: A melee attack misses you.

**Effect:** The attack hits a different enemy you are engaged with
instead, but deals only half damage.

##### Adventurer Feat

The power also triggers on a ranged attack against AC.

##### Champion Feat

The deflected attack now deals full damage instead of half damage.

##### Epic Feat

Using *deflection* no longer spends your momentum.

#### Slick Feint

Melee attack

At-Will

**First** **Target:** One enemy engaged with you

**Attack:** Charisma + Level vs. MD

**Hit:** The target is dazed until the end of your next turn, and you
can make an improved attack against a second target.

Miss (First Target): Your attack action is over; the feint was a
screw-up.

**Second** **Target:** A different enemy from the first target that is
engaged with you

**Attack:** Dexterity + Level +2 vs. AC

**Hit:** WEAPON + Dexterity damage.

Miss (Second Target): Damage equal to your level.

#### Thief's Strike

Note: This is a bonus 3^rd^-level power for rogues with the Thievery
talent. Other rogues can choose it if they like.

Melee attack

At-Will

**Target:** One enemy

**Attack:** Dexterity + Level vs. PD

**Hit:** Half of WEAPON + Dexterity damage (including Sneak Attack
damage if any), and roll a normal save. If you succeed, you can

**Miss:** ---

### 5^th^ Level Powers

#### Harmless Misdirection

Momentum power

At-Will (once per round)

Interrupt action; requires momentum

Trigger: You miss with a melee attack while an ally is engaged with the

attack you during its next turn as long as your ally remains engaged
with it.

#### Spiky Bastard

Daily

Quick action

**Effect:** You go all-out to hurt anyone who tries to get a piece of
you. For the rest of the battle, while you\'re conscious, using at least
one bladed weapon, and are not staggered or stunned, you deal 10 damage
to each enemy that makes a melee attack against you and rolls a natural
odd attack roll. The damage hits the enemy before their attack damages
you.

##### Champion Feat

*Spiky bastard* damage now applies when you are staggered, though
obviously not while you are unconscious.

##### Epic Feat

If the escalation die is 3+, the damage increases to 15 instead of 10.

#### Swift Dodge

Momentum power

At-Will (once per round)

Interrupt action; requires momentum

Trigger: You are hit by an attack against AC.

The attack reroll takes a --2 penalty.

#### Assassin's Gambit

Melee attack

At-Will

**Target:** One enemy

**Hit:** Half of WEAPON + Dexterity damage (including Sneak Attack
damage if any), and if you drop a non-mook target to 0 hp, you can take
another standard action this turn.

##### Epic Feat

Once a turn, you can get the extra standard action when this attack
drops a mook target.

#### Swift Riposte

Momentum power

At-Will (once per round)

Interrupt action; you must spend your momentum

Trigger: An enemy targets you with a melee attack.

**Effect:** You can make a basic attack against your attacker. If your
natural attack roll equals or beats your attacker's roll, resolve your
basic attack against that enemy first. If your attack roll is lower,
your attack has no effect, regardless of whether it hits or misses.

**Special:** You can't gain momentum from hitting with swift riposte.

##### Champion Feat

If your *swift riposte* attack is a critical hit, the enemy's attack
misses.

##### Epic Feat

You gain a +2 attack bonus with *swift riposte* attacks.

### 9^th^ Level Powers

#### Death's Twin

Momentum power

At-Will

Standard action on your turn; you must spend your momentum

**Effect:** You can make two basic attacks at any point during your
turn, each against a different target. You only regain momentum if your
second attack hits.

##### Epic Feat

If your attack against your first *death's twin* target is a natural
18+, you can make your second basic attack against that same target.

#### True Targeting

Momentum power

At-Will

Interrupt action OR free action on your turn; you must spend your
momentum

Trigger: An invisible or otherwise hidden enemy attacks you, or you try
to attack an invisible or hidden enemy.

**Effect:** The attacker's invisibility isn't going to work on you. It
might work against your allies, but you see through it and can tell
where the creature is well enough to target it normally or be aware of

### Class Features

All sorcerers share three general class features: Access to Wizardry,
Dancing Lights, and Gather Power. *Breath weapon*, *chain*, and *random
energy* are keywords used in sorcerer spells

#### Access to Wizardry

Starting at 3^rd^ level, you can take a wizard spell in place of a
sorcerer spell. The wizard spell must be two levels lower than the
sorcerer spell.

#### Breath Weapon

Spells with the *breath weapon* keyword have a chance to be re-used
during battle. Each *breath weapon* spell lists the chance of re-using
it (usually 16+). At the start of each round after you've cast the
*breath weapon* spell, make the re-use roll. Success indicates that you
may re-use that spell as a standard action, but for that round only. If
you fail the re-use roll, you don't have the option to re-use the spell,
but you get another chance at the beginning of the next round.

The *breath weapon* power lasts for a single battle only.

You can have only one *breath weapon* spell active at a time. If you
cast a different *breath weapon* spell when you have an earlier spell
active, the new spell cancels the earlier spell. (See the Chromatic
Destroyer Heritage talent for the path to multiple *breath weapon*
spells.)

Failing a death save cancels any *breath weapon* spells you have active.

##### Adventurer Feat

Failing a death save no longer cancels your *breath weapon* spells. Keep
rolling the entire battle.

#### Chain

When you attack with a *chain* spell and get a natural even roll, you
can roll another attack against a different enemy within range. Keep on
rolling attacks as long as you get even rolls and don't run out of new
targets. Each enemy can be targeted only once.

#### Dancing Lights

All sorcerers can cast the *dancing lights* spell as a standard action.
Unlike the wizard's *light* cantrip, the sorcerer's *dancing lights*
spell produces a number of varicolored light globes that bloom within 5
to 30 feet of the sorcerer every two to five seconds. The sorcerer has
very little control over the exact location or illumination provided by
the lights, meaning that they can occasionally be used for dramatic plot
purposes.

#### Gather Power

Once initiative has been rolled and a battle is underway, a sorcerer can
spend a standard action to gather magical power, preparing themselves
for casting a double-strength spell with their next standard action.
Gathering power is loud and very noticeable.

Sorcerers who want to gather power before initiative has been rolled can
go through the motions but won't get any benefit from the act.

When a sorcerer gathers power, it does not count as casting a spell; you
can gather power without taking opportunity attacks.

In addition, because you spend your standard action to gather power, you
generate a small magical benefit. Like many of your powers, this benefit
is chaotic rather than perfectly reliable, so you must make a random
check to see what benefit you get. Roll a d6 and consult the appropriate
table below.

If you get a benefit that deals damage to enemies, you can choose the
type of damage (cold, fire, lightning, or thunder).

##### Chaotic Benefit, Adventurer Tier (levels 1--4)

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Roll (d6) Effect
  --------- -------------------------------------------------------------
  1-2       You gain a +1 bonus to AC until the start of your next turn.

  3-4       Deal damage equal to your level to all nearby staggered
            enemies.

  5-6       Deal damage equal to your level to one nearby enemy.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

##### Chaotic Benefit, Champion Tier (levels 5--7)

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Roll    Effect
  (d6)    
  ------- ---------------------------------------------------------------
  1-2     You gain a +1 bonus to AC and Physical Defense until the start
          of your next turn.

  3-4     Deal damage equal to your level + your Charisma modifier to all
          nearby staggered enemies.

  5-6     Deal damage equal to your level + your Charisma modifier to one
          nearby enemy.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

##### Chaotic Benefit, Epic Tier (levels 8--10) 

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Roll    Effect
  (d6)    
  ------- ---------------------------------------------------------------
  1-2     You gain a +1 bonus to all defenses until the start of your
          next turn.

  3-4     Deal damage equal to your level + twice your Charisma modifier
          to all nearby staggered enemies.

  5-6     Deal damage equal to your level + twice your Charisma modifier
          to one nearby enemy.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

After you have gathered power, you can use your next standard action to
cast an empowered sorcerer spell. Empowered sorcerer spells deal double
the damage of a normal sorcerer spell. This means that you double the
damage results of the hit or a miss from the single spell. Non-attack
spells generally don't improve when cast empowered; use empowered
casting for attacks.

If you do not or are not able to use your next standard action to cast a
sorcerer attack spell, you lose the power you've gathered. You can use
another standard action to gather power again, but the spell you
eventually cast will still only do double damage.

You can spend your move actions and quick actions any way you like after
you gather power and before casting your next empowered spell. Yes, once
a battle has started it's possible to perform the magical firefight
trick of gathering power while hiding to the side of the cave entrance,
then jumping into the cave opening on your next turn and blasting with
the empowered spell.

Breath weapon spells add an extra wrinkle. Of course you can gather
power the first time you cast a breath weapon spell in a battle. Later
in the fight it's a question of whether you gathered power the turn
before a breath weapon spell roll goes your way. You can be all ready
with gathered power but roll too low to use the breath weapon spell,
forcing you to cast a different spell with the gathered power.

If you\'ve gathered power for a spell that deals ongoing damage, the
ongoing damage is doubled the first time it is dealt, but not on
subsequent rounds, if any.

##### Adventurer Feat

Once per battle, you can choose the chaotic benefit you want instead of
rolling for it.

##### Champion Feat

Once per battle when the escalation die is 4+, you can gather power as a
quick action.

##### Epic Feat

When you gather power, if the escalation die is 2+, you can roll two
chaotic benefits. Unlike most effects, the benefits stack if you roll
the same result twice.

#### Random Energy

Some sorcerer spells deal damage of a random type. If it matters for the
situation, use a d4 to determine which type of damage the spell deals.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Roll (d4)                     Energy Type
  ----------------------------- -----------------------------------------
  1                             Cold

  2                             Fire

  3                             Lightning

  4                             Thunder
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Class Talents

#### About Heritage Talents

Sorcerers possess innate talent for magic that is impulsive and chaotic
where wizardry is measured and studied. Most sorcerers have strong
magical links to one of the icons.

#### Arcane Heritage

Although magic is in the blood of every sorcerer, you have a greater
understanding of magic than most sorcerers and even some wizards.

You gain a +2 bonus to a background that involves or suggests magical
knowledge or talent, up to your normal maximum background point limit.

You can also use one of your sorcerer spell choices to choose any wizard
spell of the same level. You get only one such equal-level wizard spell
at a time; all others have to be purchased using the 2-level penalty in
the Access to Wizardry class feature described above.

##### Adventurer Feat

Use your Charisma as the attack ability for the wizard spell you choose
with your Arcane Heritage talent.

##### Champion Feat

You can cast your wizard spells empowered as if they were sorcerer
powers. Generally, empowering wizard spells only helps by doubling the
damage.

#### Blood Link

Choose one of your sorcerous heritage talents. You gain 1 relationship
point with the icon associated with that heritage; you choose whether
the point is positive, conflicted, or negative. This point can add to
your normal relationship points but you can't exceed the normal
relationship maximums with it. (Remember that positive relationships
with villainous icons are limited to 1 point.)

##### Champion Feat

Gain another relationship point with an icon associated with one of your
heritage talents. As above, you must follow the relationship maximums.

#### Chromatic Destroyer Heritage 

You can have multiple *breath weapon* spells active at the same time.
You don't gain extra actions, so if you succeed with multiple *breath
weapon* spells, you'll generally have to choose which one to use.

##### Adventurer Feat

You gain a +2 attack bonus with empowered *breath weapon* spells.

##### Champion Feat

Once per day, turn a failed *breath weapon* re-use roll into a success.

##### Epic Feat

One battle per day, gain resist dragon attack 16+ (all attacks made by
dragons; dragon must roll natural 16+ with the attack or it deals only
half damage).

#### Fey Heritage 

One battle per day, when you roll initiative, you can choose to invoke
your Fey Heritage and gain the racial power of one the elven races in
addition to your own racial power. Roll on the table below. If you roll
your own race's power, you gain the half-elf's *surprising* racial power
instead.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Roll (d6)          Racial Power
  ------------------ ----------------------------------------------------
  1-2                Cruel (drow)

  3-4                Highblood teleport (high elf)

  5-6                Elven grace (wood elf)
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

##### Adventurer Feat

You can now invoke your Fey Heritage talent in two battles each day.

##### Champion Feat

You gain a +2 attack bonus against elves and monsters in the elven
sphere of influence (including the Drider, Storm Giant, and Medusa).

##### Epic Feat

Once per battle when the escalation die reaches 6+, as a free action,
you can gain an elf racial power that you have not already used in this
battle.

#### Infernal Heritage

Once per day, as a quick action when the escalation die is 1+, you can
enter a spell frenzy until the end of the battle.

While in a spell frenzy, you roll 2d20 for each of your sorcerer spell
attacks. Use the highest die as your attack roll, but track whether the
other die hits.

For each die that misses, you take damage equal to double the level of
the target of your attack.

##### Adventurer Feat

You gain resist energy damage 12+ to fire and to one of the following
types of energy of your choice: acid, cold, lightning, psychic, thunder.

##### Champion Feat

Increase one of your resistances to 16+.

##### Epic Feat

In addition to your normal use of spell frenzy, you can also enter a
spell frenzy as a free action while the escalation die is 5+.

#### Metallic Protector Heritage 

Your rolls to re-use breath weapon spells during a fight gain a +2
bonus.

##### Adventurer Feat

As a quick action at the start of each battle, you can gain resist
energy 12+ to one of the following types of energy of your choice: acid,
cold, fire, lightning, or poison.

##### Champion Feat

When you gather power and your chaotic benefit increases your defenses,
you can choose one nearby ally to gain the same defense bonus.

##### Epic Feat

One battle per day, you can choose to gain resist demon attack 16+
instead of resist energy 12+ from your Metallic Protector Heritage
talent.

#### Sorcerer's Familiar

You have a familiar much like a wizard's familiar, but more changeable.
Unlike the wizard, you don't choose two abilities for your familiar.
Instead you choose one permanent ability that suits your familiar's
nature; the only limitation is that you can't choose *tough* as the
permanent ability. Each time you get a full heal-up, randomly determine
two *other* abilities your familiar will possess until your next full
heal-up.

##### Adventurer Feat

Your familiar gains another randomly changing ability.

##### Champion Feat

Once per level, if your familiar is close to you, it can cast one of
your spells as a free action on your initiative count, even if you have
already expended the spell. The spell functions as if you had cast it.

##### Epic Feat

Your familiar gains another randomly changing ability.

#### Spell Fist

Your style of sorcery emphasizes close-range fighting. There are two
advantages and one possible drawback to your style.

You gain a +2 bonus to AC.

You can use ranged spells while engaged with enemies without taking
opportunity attacks.

You use your Constitution modifier instead of your Charisma modifier to
determine the damage you add to all your sorcerer spells.

##### Adventurer Feat

When you miss with a sorcerer spell against an enemy you are engaged
with, add your Charisma modifier to the damage you deal. At 5^th^ level,
add double your Charisma modifier; at 8^th^ level, triple it.

##### Champion Feat

Once per battle, you can include one enemy engaged with you as an
additional target of any attack spell you cast that targets other
enemies.

##### Epic Feat

Once per day when you cast an empowered spell, each enemy engaged with
you becomes an additional target of that spell if it's not already
targeted by the spell.

#### Undead Remnant Heritage 

You have resist negative energy 12+ and gain a +1 attack bonus against
undead. You can also include negative energy damage on your personal
random energy damage type table, swapping out an energy type you don't
want to access randomly.

##### Adventurer Feat

Decrease your total recoveries by 1; you gain a +2 bonus to death saves.

##### Champion Feat

Your resist negative energy power improves to 16+, and the attack bonus
against undead increases to +2.

##### Epic Feat

If you put out one of your eyes and cut off one of your hands, you gain
a +1 bonus to all attacks.

#### Dragon's Leap

Ranged spell

Daily

Quick action to cast

**Target:** You; breath weapon

**Effect:** You can fly at the rate you normally move until the end of

fall.)

> 5^th^ level spell: You can now fly until the end of your next turn.
>
> 7^th^ level spell: You can now fly twice as fast as you normally move
> on the ground. You also gain a +5 bonus to disengage checks.
>

> of daily.

*Breath Weapon*: For the rest of the battle, roll a d20 at the start of
each of your turns; on a 16+, you can use *dragon's leap* this turn if
you wish. (Yeah, we know it's not actually a breath weapon, but it works
as part of the draconic sorcerer package.)

#### Echoing Thunder

Ranged spell

At-Will

**Target:** One nearby enemy

**Attack:** Charisma + Level vs. PD

**Hit:** 3d6 + Charisma thunder damage, and the first enemy that hits
you with a melee attack before the start of your next turn takes 2d6

>
> 7^th^ level spell: 7d6 damage; 3d6 aftershock damage.

> on a miss.

##### Epic Feat

Double the spell's ongoing damage on a miss.

each of your turns; on a 16+, you can use *breath of the black* that
turn if you wish.

#### The Elven Shadows

Ranged spell

Daily

**Special:** Once you cast this spell in a battle, you can cast it
at-will for the rest of that battle.

**Target:** One nearby enemy

#### Three Dooms

Ranged spell

Recharge 16+ after battle

**Target:** One nearby enemy; chain spell

**Attack:** Charisma + Level vs. PD

**Hit:** 2d4 x 10 random energy damage, and you take damage of the same
type equal to the unmodified dice roll (2d4, 2d8, or 2d12). (Note that
there's no Charisma bonus to damage.)

**Miss:** Half damage, and you still take random energy damage equal to
the unmodified dice roll.

> 7^th^ level spell: 2d8 x 10 damage.
>
> 9^th^ level spell: 2d12 x 10 damage.

***Chain Spell*:** Each time you make a natural even attack roll, you
can attack a different target with the spell.

#### Unearthly Glamour

Ranged spell

Daily

**Effect:** You gain a +5 bonus to all Charisma skill checks for the
next five minutes. If you fail a Charisma skill check during this time,
however, anyone you were attempting to convince or influence with the
check is freaked out or disgusted by the supernatural glamour attached
to you and has extremely negative reactions to you.

> 7^th^ level spell: The effect lasts for 1 hour.
>
> 9^th^ level spell: The effect lasts for 2 hours.

### 7^th^ Level Spells

#### Breath of the Blue

Close-quarters spell

Daily

**Target:** One nearby enemy; breath spell

target's next turn, 1d6 of its nearby allies take 20 lightning damage.

allies.

##### Epic Feat

You can now target a faraway enemy with the spell (no attack penalty).

of each of your turns; on a 16+, you can use *breath of the blue* this
turn if you wish.

#### Stolen Faces

Ranged spell

Daily

Free action to cast, before initiative is rolled

Targets: 1d4 + 1 nearby allies

**Effect:** You steal the once-per-battle racial powers of your allies
this battle, but you don't get the advantage of your allies' feats or
items that improve those powers.

Each ally you steal a racial power from can roll an easy save (6+).
Success means they get to use their power also this battle. Failure
means they can't; you took it fully.

You can't steal racial powers you already possess.

> 9^th^ level spell: You get to use your allies' powers as if you also
> had any of their feats that improve those powers.

#### Touch of Evil

Close-quarters spell

Daily

Quick action to cast

**Special:** If you are fighting one or more demons, roll an easy save
(6+) at the start of each of your turns. Failure means that you are
confused that turn.

**Target:** You

**Effect:** You gain a random demon-style power for the rest of the
battle, similar to the abilities demons possess but not identical.

Roll a d8 to see which power you gain:

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Roll   Power        Description
  (d8)                
  ------ ------------ ----------------------------------------------------
  1      Resist       When an attack that deals energy damage targets you,
         energy 16+   the attacker must roll a natural 16+ on the attack
                      roll or it only deals half damage.

  2      Infernal     Until the end of the battle, you can use a quick
         battery      action once each round to make recharge rolls for
                      your expended recharge spells. Each time you do so,
                      you take damage equal to half the natural result of
                      your recharge roll.

  3      Backlash     The first time you are staggered this battle, the
                      enemy who staggered you becomes confused (save
                      ends).

  4      Spell frenzy You enter a spell frenzy (see Infernal Heritage
                      talent). If you were already in a spell frenzy, you
                      now roll 3d20 for each attack and take damage equal
                      to triple the target's level for each roll that
                      misses.

  5      Fear aura    Enemies engaged with you that have fewer hit points
                      than double your current hit points are dazed. They
                      cannot use the escalation die.

  6      Teleport     As a move action, you can teleport anywhere you can
         1d3 + 1      see nearby.
         times this   
         battle       

  7      Demonic      You can take an extra standard action each turn that
         speed        the escalation die is even. You lose 2d10 hit points
                      each time you use the extra action.

  8      Eye of the   Choose any two features you want. For the rest of
         demon        this day, all your icon relationships disappear and
                      are replaced by an identical number of conflicted
                      points with a villainous icon (preferably one that
                      is demonic).
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 9^th^ Level Spells

#### Breath of the Void

Close-quarters spell

Daily

**Target:** One nearby enemy; breath spell

**Attack:** Charisma + Level vs. MD

**Hit:** 2d12 x 10 + Charisma negative energy damage, and the target
moves down 2d6 points in initiative order, to a minimum of 1.

**Miss:** Half damage.

*Breath Weapon*: For the rest of the battle, roll a d20 at the start of
each of your turns; on a 16+, you can use *breath of the void* this turn
if you wish.

#### Calling the Blood

Close-quarters spell

Daily

**Effect:** Randomly select an icon (preferably a sorcerous one). You
gain some surprising or bizarre magical effect associated with the power
of that icon to assist you. The effect is entirely up to the GM, though
the immediate impact of the spell should always be favorable for you.
The long-term consequences of randomly invoking the power of an icon
that may be an enemy might not be favorable for you, and should be
played for narrative interest by the GM, particularly if the impact of
the spell was huge for you. Since this is a daily spell, sizeable impact
is fine, but don't award any extra effect for empowered casting,
especially since the spell can be cast effectively out of combat.

##### Epic Feat

Randomly choose twice, then choose the single result you prefer.

#### Silver Flame

Close-quarters spell

Daily

Quick action to cast

**Effect:** Roll your relationship dice that you have with a sorcerous
heroic icon.

For each 6 you roll, you gain one 7^th^ level or lower spell from any
spellcasting class that you can cast this battle. For each 5 you roll,
you gain one 5^th^ level or lower spell from any spellcasting class that
you can cast this battle.

If the escalation die is 5+, you can swap the escalation die for one or
your rolls. If you get no successes, you regain the spell after this
battle.

You can acquire one of the new spells the same round you cast this
spell. Then select and acquire any other gained spells at the start of
your next turn.

You can use your Charisma as the ability score that provides the
acquired spells' attack bonuses and damage bonuses (if any). Other
ability score references remain unchanged.

As you might expect, each 5 you roll also invokes an icon-related
complication or obligation in the tradition of rolling 5s on
relationship checks.

## Wizard

\* A wizard needs one free hand on a spellcasting implement to cast
spells. As such, they suffer a penalty for using a two-handed weapon.
(The penalty applies to spells also.)

### Class Features

Wizards have four class features: Cantrips, Cyclic Spells, Overworld
Advantage, and Ritual Magic.

#### Cantrips 

Every wizard can cast a handful of cantrips each day. You don't have to
memorize or choose them beforehand, you just cast them on the fly.

Wizards can cast a number of cantrips equal to their Intelligence
modifier each battle. Each cantrip takes a standard action to cast as a
ranged spell. Outside of battle, a wizard can cast about three to six
cantrips every five minutes. The Cantrip Mastery talent speeds up
cantrip casting.

At the adventurer tier (levels 1--4), cantrips with a standard duration
last 10--60 minutes, plus 10 minutes per wizard level. The GM rolls and
the wizard becomes aware that their cantrip is about to end a couple
minutes before it's done.

At the champion tier, levels 5--7, most cantrips last 1--6 hours.

At the epic tier, levels 8--10, cantrips last between 2--12 hours.

For a list of available cantrips, see Cantrips.

#### Cyclic Spells

Spells that have a cyclic usage can always be cast at least once per
battle, and are only expended in that battle if they are cast when the
escalation die is 0 or odd. In other words, if you cast a cyclic spell
like color spray or rebuke when the escalation die is even, the spell is
not expended and can still be cast later in the battle.

#### Overworld Advantage

Wizardly magic taps into the power of the overworld. While a wizard is
in the overworld, their daily spells become recharge 16+ after battle.

#### Ritual Magic

Wizards can cast their spells as rituals.

##### Champion Feat

You can cast full rituals by using all your actions each round to focus
on the ritual for 1d3 + 1 rounds. As with standard rituals, your fast
rituals are not meant to replace combat spells; they're a means of
acquiring and improvising wondrous magical effects rather than a means
of inflicting damage and conditions.

### Class Talents

Choose three of the following class talents.

#### Abjuration

Whenever you cast a daily wizard spell, you gain a +4 AC bonus until the
end of your next turn.

##### Adventurer Feat

The bonus also applies to your Physical Defense.

##### Champion Feat

You gain 2d12 temporary hit points each time you cast a daily spell.

##### Epic Feat

The bonus also applies to Mental Defense.

#### Cantrip Mastery

Cantrips are at-will spells for you.

Unlike normal wizards, who use a standard action to cast a cantrip, you
can cast a cantrip as a quick action.

To do something particularly cunning or surprising with one of your
cantrips where the GM isn't sure whether you could pull off that use of
the spell, roll a normal save (11+) to cast the spell the way you
envision it.

Additionally, you can expend a 3^rd^ level spell slot or higher to
choose one cantrip per spell slot you have given up and create a
once-per-day related effect with it that is much greater, if you and
your GM can agree on a cool effect that suits the cantrip.

##### Adventurer Feat

You can use cantrip-style versions of any wizard spell you have
memorized. When you expend a spell, however, you can't make
cantrip-style use of it any more. The key is that none of these uses
should be combat relevant or deal damage.

The Cantrip Mastery talent is more about enhance the roleplaying and
less about combat usefulness.

#### Evocation

Once per battle, when you cast a spell that targets Physical Defense,
before rolling for the number of targets or making the spell's attack
roll, you can expend your quick action to evoke the spell. Hit or miss,
you\'ll max out the spell's damage dice (except on a natural one, which
deals no damage to the target and likely damages the caster in some
manner).

##### Champion Feat

Whenever you evoke a spell, you can reroll one of the attack rolls if
that natural roll was less than or equal to the escalation die. You must
take the new result.

#### High Arcana

Your study of the highest orders of magic gives you options that lesser
wizards cannot match: Memorization and a bonus spell: counter-magic

##### Memorization

When you pick your spells, you can choose any daily wizard spell twice
(instead of once). This doesn't apply to spells that start as recharge
spells. For example, at 7^th^ level when you have five 7^th^ level
spells and four 5^th^ level spells, you could choose fireball twice as a
7^th^ level spell, or once as a 7^th^ level spell and once as a 5^th^
level spell. (Your 3^rd^ level spell slot can't be used for fireball
because fireball starts as a 5^th^ level spell.)

##### Counter-magic

Close-quarters spell

Once per battle

Free action to cast

Trigger: A nearby creature you can see casts a spell.

**Target:** The nearby creature casting a spell.

**Attack:** Intelligence + Level vs. MD

**Hit:** The target's spell is canceled, and the caster loses the action
they were using for the spell. If the spell had a limited use, that use
is expended if your natural attack roll is even.

##### Champion Feat

You can now cast *counter-magic* twice per battle.

##### Epic Feat

You can now cast *counter-magic* in reaction to a creature using any
magical ability, not just casting a spell.

#### Polysyllabic Verbalizations

Rename each of your daily and recharge spells. Think up the most
over-the-top and extravagant names you can muster. Since these alternate
spells are so lengthy, they take an additional quick action to cast.
While the regular effects of the spells are the same as the more common
versions, they have a small bonus effect appropriate to the situation.

The bonus effect is determined by the GM, or by a collaboration between
the GM and the player. It should add to the storytelling power of the
situation.

The bonus effect should suit the name of the spell or the way it's
delivered, and shouldn't precisely match up with what the spell normally
accomplishes.

#### Wizard's Familiar

Your familiar is a tiny or small animal or creature that aids your magic
and provides companionship. It also provides opportunities for
improvisation between you and the GM.

Your familiar is as intelligent as a normal person. It can communicate
with you and will stay close you unless you've chosen abilities that let
it roam. Your familiar is on your side but it's not perfectly in your
control.

If your familiar dies, it can come back to you the next time you get a
full heal-up. (The method or story used is between you and the GM.)
Alternatively, you can get a new familiar.

Familiars are useless in combat, except as indicated by their abilities.
Ordinarily they aren't damaged by enemy attacks and spells unless the
story calls for it.

##### Familiar Abilities

Choose two of the following abilities for your familiar.

###### Agile

You gain a +2 bonus to Dexterity skill checks.

###### Alert, Maybe Even Insightful

You gain a +2 bonus to Wisdom skill checks.

###### Counter-bite

Each battle, if your familiar is close to you, it bites the first enemy
that hits you with a melee attack after that attack, dealing 1d4 damage
per level (no attack roll) to that enemy.

###### Flight

Your familiar flies as well as a hawk. It doesn't fly that often and
usually sticks with you, but it can do so when its other abilities
allow.

###### Mimic

One battle per day, you gain the use of the racial power (without feats)
of one nearby ally.

###### Poisonous

Once per battle, when you hit an enemy engaged with you, you can add 5
ongoing poison damage per tier to the damage roll.

###### Scout

Once per day, your familiar can separate itself from you and make a
reconnaissance run of an area or location. Roll an easy skill check for
the environment to get your familiar to scout unseen.

###### Tough

You gain a +1 save bonus. Tough counts as two familiar abilities.

###### Talkative

Your familiar can talk like a person (but the GM speaks for the familiar
more than you do).

##### Feat Tiers

###### Adventurer Feat

Your familiar gains another ability.

###### Champion Feat

Once per level, if your familiar is close to you, it can cast one of
your spells as a free action on your initiative count, even if you have
already expended the spell. The spell functions as if you had cast it.

###### Epic Feat

Your familiar gains another ability.

### Cantrips

#### Alarm (standard duration)

The cantrip creates a minor watch-sprite that can be instructed to
scream if someone comes through an area or touches an object.
Watch-sprites are notoriously stupid and sleepy, but with the right
talking-to they might stay focused for the duration of the spell. At
higher levels, the spell might summon little fanged spirits buzzing back
and forth serving as both visual and actual deterrents.

#### Arcane Mark (standard duration)

The cantrip creates a magical sigil on an object or person. These sigils
are usually plain to see, though a deliberately invisible mark can be
made. It takes a difficult perception or magic check to notice.

#### Ghost Sound

This spell creates false noises emanating from somewhere nearby. The
effect is like an exceptionally good version of throwing your voice, if
your voice could create a wide variety of sounds. Attempted distractions
with the cantrip are DC 15 challenges in adventurer environments, higher
as you move into champion and epic environments. If someone is using
ghost sound against the PCs, a Wisdom-based skill check can identify the
sound as a magical fake.

#### Knock

This cantrip summons a magical servitor three to four times as big as
your closed fist that swarms around the door and attempts to punch or
push it open (depending on whether you want to be quiet or announce your
presence). Success is determined with an Intelligence check against the
environment's DC using an appropriate magical background. This cantrip
does nothing to avoid any traps that might exist.

#### Light (standard duration)

This cantrip creates a fairly wide and consistent field of light, up to
30 feet in diameter, though it isn't bright enough to dazzle.

#### Mage Hand

This cantrip creates a small telekinetic effect that lasts a round at
most. At best it's about half as strong as the wizard's own strongest
hand. At worst it's half as strong as the wizard when they're weak from
a bad fever.

#### Mending

This cantrip summons a variety of tiny (hand-sized and smaller) magical
sprites who swarm over a chosen broken object attempting to mend it
(over the course of 1--6 rounds). Small-scale repairs like torn
wineskins, muddy clothing, a broken handgrip on a sword, and similar
repairs that anyone could fix with two to four hours of devoted work
gets handled in seconds. More elaborate repairs to complicated objects
might require an Intelligence check, or at the GM's discretion could
only be possible if the wizard has taken the Cantrip Mastery talent.

#### Prestidigitation

This cantrip produces magic tricks and small illusions. One casting
usually gives you a minute of fun. The magic has nowhere near as much
real world force as mage hand.

#### Spark

This is a minor fire creation spell, enough to light a pipe, or a
campfire, or even a page or two of an unprotected spellbook. It doesn't
work against living beings or against things that couldn't easily be set
on fire with a few seconds of steady application of a candle. The target
of the spark has to be nearby and in sight.

### Utility Spell

When you choose spells during a full heal-up, instead of taking a
standard spell, you can choose to give up a spell slot to memorize the
*utility spell* at the same level. When you take the *utility spell*,
you gain access to a range of useful non-combat spells of the level you
memorized it or below. You cast each *utility spell* at the level of the
spell slot you gave up for it. You can give up multiple spell slots to
take *utility spell* multiple times.

Choose from among the following utility spells:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Spell Level                   Spell
  ----------------------------- -----------------------------------------
  1^st^ level                   *disguise self*

  1^st^ level                   *feather fall*

  1^st^ level                   *hold portal*

  3^rd^ level                   *levitate*

  3^rd^ level                   *message*

  3^rd^ level                   *speak with item*

  5^th^ level                   *water breathing*

  7^th^ level                   *scrying*
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Feat Tiers

##### Adventurer Feat

Each *utility spell* you take lets you cast two spells from the
available options instead of one.

##### Champion Feat

As above, but you can cast three *utility spells* instead of one.

#### 1^st^ Level Utility: Disguise Self

Close-quarters spell

Daily

**Effect:** This spell provides you with an effective magical disguise
that lasts about ten minutes, making the skill check to avoid unmasking
one step easier: easy if it would have been a normal task, normal if it
would have been a hard task, and hard if it would have been a
ridiculously hard task. The spell only affects your general appearance,
not your size. It can be used to hide your features behind the generic
features of another person or race. Using it to impersonate a specific
creature makes it less effective as a disguise (-2 to -5 penalty).

> 3^rd^ level spell: The spell lasts for 1 hour.
>
> 5^th^ level spell: The spell also provides smell; +2 bonus to any
> checks.
>
> 7^th^ level spell: The spell also handles correct-sounding vocal
> patterns and rough mannerisms; +4 bonus to any checks.
>
> 9^th^ level spell: You can now target an ally with the spell; you can
> also now use it on up to two creatures at once.

#### 1^st^ Level Utility: Feather Fall

Close-quarters spell

Daily

Free action to cast

**Effect:** When you cast this spell, it arrests your fall, letting you
glide down the ground over a round or two.

> 3^rd^ level spell: You can now target a nearby ally with the spell.
>
> 5^th^ level spell: You can now target up to two nearby creatures with
> the spell.
>
> 7^th^ level spell: You can now target up to five nearby creatures with
> the spell.
>
> 9^th^ level spell: You gain some control over where a target falls,
> like a quickly gliding feather.

#### 1^st^ Level Utility: Hold Portal

Ranged spell

Daily

**Effect:** You cast this spell on a door. For ten minutes,
adventurer-tier creatures can't get through the door. Champion-tier
creatures can batter it down; each attempt requires a DC 20 Intelligence
skill check (including an applicable background) by the caster to resist
the battering and keep the spell going. Epic-tier creatures can walk
right through.

> 3^rd^ level spell: The spell now lasts for an hour. Adventurer-tier
> creatures are stymied. Champion-tier creatures can batter the door
> down or destroy it after three failed DC 20 skill checks by the
> spellcaster. Epic creatures notice that the now-busted door had magic
> on it.
>
> 5^th^ level spell: Champion-tier creatures take a few minutes to force
> the door open. Epic creatures can force it open after one failed DC 25
> skill check by the spellcaster.
>
> 7^th^ level spell: Champion-tier creatures are stymied for up to an
> hour by the door. Epic tier creatures get through after three failed
> DC 25 skill checks by the spellcaster.
>
> 9^th^ level spell: Champion-tier creatures can't enter. Epic-tier
> creatures can't get through for an hour.

#### 3^rd^ Level Utility: Levitate

Ranged spell

Daily

**Effect:** Until the end of the battle, you can use a move action to
rise straight up into the air or descend straight down. The spell itself
won't move you horizontally. The up-or-down movement is about half as
fast as your normal movement. While levitating, you take a --2 penalty
to your attacks and are vulnerable to attacks against you.

> 5^th^ level spell: You can now cast the spell on a nearby willing ally
> instead of yourself.
>
> 7^th^ level spell: You can now cast the spell as a quick action, and
> the spell can now affect two targets.
>
> 9^th^ level spell: The spell can now affect five targets.

#### 3^rd^ Level Utility: Message

Close-quarters spell

Daily

Quick action to cast

**Effect:** You send a one to two sentence message to another person you
know and have touched in the last week. Sending a message to a person
you can see is always easy. Sending a message to a person you can't see
requires a skill check using Intelligence against the highest-tier
environment that you or the sender are occupying.

The maximum distance you can send a message depends on the spell's
level.

> 3^rd^ level spell: Across half a city, at most.
>
> 5^th^ level spell: Across the entire city and a bit into the
> countryside.
>
> 7^th^ level spell: Between cities near to each other.
>
> 9^th^ level spell: From any city to any other city, or across a sea.

#### 3^rd^ Level Utility: Speak with Item

Close-quarters spell

Daily

Quick action to cast

**Effect:** Speak briefly, mind-to-mind, with a magic item you are
touching that is owned by you or one of your allies. The item's owner
gets a free power recharge roll if that item's power has been expended.

> 5^th^ level spell: You no longer need to be touching the item; it only
> has to be nearby.
>
> 7^th^ level spell: The item's owner gains a +2 bonus to the item
> recharge roll.
>
> 9^th^ level spell: If the item recharge roll fails, you keep this
> spell, but the item won't talk to you until after your next full
> heal-up.

#### 5^th^ Level Utility: Water Breathing

Close-quarters spell

Daily

Quick action to cast

**Effect:** You can breathe underwater for the rest of the battle (or
about five minutes). You become aware a couple of rounds ahead of when
the magic of the spell is about to end.

> 7^th^ level spell: You and 1d4 + 2 nearby allies can breathe
> underwater this battle.
>
> 9^th^ level spell: The spell affects you and 1d6 + 2 nearby allies for
> 4d6 hours.

#### 7^th^ Level Utility: Scrying

Ranged spell

Daily

**Effect:** You can use this spell to get information you shouldn't be
able to get, peering in on other people's lives for a short period of
time, usually no more than ten minutes at a time. Some areas may be
warded at the GM's discretion. You must have touched the person you wish
to spy on in the last month, or, at 9^th^ level, within the last a year.

Scrying as a single standard action won't yield much. Concentrating on
the spell for a while with props like a scrying pool or a crystal ball
will work better.

### 1^st^ Level Spells

#### Acid Arrow

Ranged spell

Daily

**Target:** One nearby or faraway creature

**Attack:** Intelligence + Level vs. PD

**Hit:** 4d10 acid damage, and 5 ongoing acid damage.

**Miss:** 5 ongoing acid damage, and you regain the spell during your
next quick rest.

> 3^rd^ level spell: 5d10 damage, and 10 ongoing damage; 10 ongoing on a
> miss.
>
> 5^th^ level spell: 8d10 damage, and 15 ongoing damage; 15 ongoing on a
> miss.
>
> 7^th^ level spell: 3d4 x 10 damage, and 25 ongoing damage; 25 ongoing
> on a miss.
>
> 9^th^ level spell: 5d4 x 10 damage, and 40 ongoing damage; 40 ongoing
> on a miss.

#### Blur

Ranged spell

Daily

**Target:** You or one nearby ally

**Effect:** For the rest of the battle (or for five minutes), attacks
against the target miss 20% of the time.

> 3^rd^ level spell: The spell is now a quick action to cast.
>
> 5^th^ level spell: Miss 25% of the time.
>
> 7^th^ level spell: Miss 30% of the time, and you can now target 1d2
> creatures with the spell.
>
> 9^th^ level spell: Miss 30% of the time, and you can now target two
> creatures with the spell.

#### Charm Person

Ranged spell

Daily

**Target:** One nearby creature with 40 hp or fewer

**Special:** This spell cannot be cast during combat or on a target that
has rolled initiative to fight.

**Attack:** Intelligence + Level vs. MD

**Hit:** The target believes you are their friend until you or your
allies take hostile action against them. (Attacking their normal allies
is okay.) If you or your allies attack the target or order the target to
attack its normal allies, the target can roll a normal save to break the
charm effect during its turn each round.

**Special:** On a miss, the spell is not detectible by most others
unless you miss by 4+ or roll a natural 1, in which case the target and
its allies knows what you tried to do and will usually be angry about
it.

> 3^rd^ level spell: Target with 64 hp or fewer.
>
> 5^th^ level spell: Target with 96 hp or fewer.
>
> 7^th^ level spell: Target with 160 hp or fewer.
>
> 9^th^ level spell: Target with 266 hp or fewer.

#### Color Spray

Close-quarters spell

Cyclic (cast once per battle OR at-will when the escalation die is even)

**Target:** 1d4 nearby enemies in a group

**Attack:** Intelligence + Level vs. MD

**Hit:** 2d8 psychic damage, and if the target has 10 hp or fewer after
the damage, it is weakened until the end of your next turn.

> 3^rd^ level spell: 4d6 damage, 20 hp or fewer.
>
> 5^th^ level spell: 6d8 damage, 30 hp or fewer.
>
> 7^th^ level spell: 10d6 damage, 40 hp or fewer.
>
> 9^th^ level spell: 10d12 damage, 60 hp or fewer.

##### Adventurer Feat

Increase the hit point threshold of the weakened effect by 5 hp.

##### Champion Feat

On a miss, the spell deals damage equal to your level.

##### Epic Feat

The spell now targets 1d4 + 1 nearby enemies in a group.

#### Magic Missile

Ranged spell

At-Will

**Target:** One nearby or faraway enemy.

**Attack:** Automatic hit

**Effect:** 2d4 force damage.

> 3^rd^ level spell: 2d8 damage.
>
> 5^th^ level spell: 4d6 damage.
>
> 7^th^ level spell: 6d6 damage.
>
> 9^th^ level spell: 10d6 damage.

##### Adventurer Feat

You can choose two targets; roll half the damage dice for one missile
and half the damage dice for the other, then assign one set of damage
dice to each of the two targets.

##### Champion Feat

Roll a d20 when you use the spell; if you roll a natural 20, the magic
missile crits and deals double damage. (Rolling a 1 is not a fumble;
this roll checks only to see if you can crit.)

##### Epic Feat

The 7^th^ and 9^th^ level versions of the spell now use d8s as damage
dice.

#### Ray of Frost

Ranged spell

At-Will

**Target:** One nearby enemy

**Attack:** Intelligence + Level vs. PD

**Hit:** 3d6 cold damage

**Miss:** Damage equal to your level.

> 3^rd^ level spell: 4d8 damage.
>
> 5^th^ level spell: 6d8 damage.
>
> 7^th^ level spell: 7d10 damage.
>
> 9^th^ level spell: 10d12 damage.

**Effect:** On the target's next turn (not this one, if you cast it on
yourself), the target gains an additional standard action.

In addition, at the start of each of the target's turns this battle, if
the escalation die is even, roll a d20 and add the escalation die; on a
16+, the target gains an additional standard action that turn.

9^th^ level spell: The roll for additional standard actions is now 11+
instead of 16+.

#### Invisibility Purge

there or not

**Attack:** Intelligence + Level vs. MD, rolled by GM

**Hit:** The target turns visible and cannot become invisible again this

**Attack:** Intelligence + Level vs. MD

gone, dusted, nothing remaining.

**Miss:** Half damage.

##### Epic Feat

You can now target a faraway creature with the spell.

#### Meteor Swarm

Ranged spell

Daily

**Special:** You summon a meteor swarm. If you're underground, you get
the ur-dark stalactite equivalent! Nothing more happens this round, but
roll 1d3 + 1 to determine how many meteors you have summoned.

At the start of your next turn, even if you are unconscious or dead or
have left the area, the meteors arrive one per turn at the start of each
of your turns and slam into the combat area.

**Target:** You can make an attack with each meteor against 1d4 enemies
in a group. Alternatively, use the spell to level an area with high
impact property damage.

**Attack:** Intelligence + Level vs. PD

**Hit:** 4d4 x 10 damage of the energy type of your choice (cold, fire,
lightning).

Any allies engaged with the enemies you are targeting take one-fourth

Each meteor now deals 5d4 x 10 damage.

#### Teleport

Ranged spell

Daily

**Effect:** You and up to 4 allies next to you can teleport to any
location in the world, underworld, or overworld that you have previously
visited.

When you teleport, roll a d20. If you roll a 1, you miss your desired
location and arrive somewhere else altogether. Otherwise, you and your
allies arrive at the desired location at the start of your next turn.

Any effects of spells or items cast before teleporting are dispelled and
no longer function on arrival.

##### Epic Feat

Your allies don't need to be next to you before you cast the spell, just
nearby. Alternately, if they are all next to you when you cast the
spell, you can teleport to a location known to one of your allies.

# Multiclassing

A multiclass character belongs to two classes instead of one.
Multiclassing provides versatility---two classes offer more options than
one at the expense of raw power.

You can start at 1^st^ level with a multiclass character or convert to
being a multiclass character when you gain a level. Changing from a
single-class character to a multiclass character during a campaign is
often a consequence of some powerful story event.

The core multiclass rule is that you can't apply a talent, feat, or
class feature to a spell or attack from a different class. For example,
a barbarian/rogue who is raging makes barbarian attacks, rolling 2d20s
to hit, but can't add rogue Sneak Attack damage on top of the barbarian
melee attack. Likewise, a rogue that uses *shadow walk* has to make a
rogue attack upon returning to play, not a barbarian rage attack.
Another example: a sorcerer/wizard or sorcerer/cleric can't gather power
as a sorcerer and then get double damage casting a spell from their
other class.

Some multiclass feats might break these general rules.

These prohibitions usually don't apply to effects you create that don't
require actions to maintain. A cleric/barbarian could use an invocation
at the start of the battle, cast a spell, and then start raging. The
effects of the invocation would continue since it doesn't require new
actions to sustain it.

Rage, on the other hand, is a special case, preventing actions from
other classes even though you don't have to use actions to keep raging.

## Multiclassing Basics

This is the guide to creating a multiclass character. If there's an
element of character class configuration not mentioned, assume that it
works the same for multiclass characters as it does for single-class
characters.

For character class specifics, see below. Note that many multiclasses
offer bonus feats that help make up for some disadvantages when
multiclassing.

### Terminology

Your multiclass is a combination of your two classes separated by a
slash. There's no significance to the order. A fighter/wizard is the
same as a wizard/fighter.

Technically, the rules presented here are for *dual-classing*, i.e.
combining only two classes.

### Level progression

You gain levels like any other character. For example, a 3^rd^ level
fighter/wizard is a 3^rd^ level character, with 3^rd^ level hit points
and three feats (or four for a human). You add your level (3) to your
attacks, to your defenses, and to your skill checks. You level up as
fast as other characters and you never have to worry about gaining
specific or separate class levels.

On the other hand, leveling up is not *exactly* like a single-class
character. Multiclass characters have the class powers, attacks,
maneuvers, bonus talents, and spells of a character that is one level
lower than their actual level.

For example, as a 3^rd^ level fighter/wizard, you'll use the fighter and
wizard level progression tables for 2^nd^ level. In this example, as a
fighter, you'll know 4 maneuvers and they'll all still have to be from
the 1^st^ level pool. As a wizard, you'll know six 1^st^ level spells.
At 4^th^ level, you then gain the maneuvers of a single-class 3^rd^
level fighter and the spells of a single-class 3^rd^ level wizard.

### What you get as a 1^st^ level multiclass character

Each multiclass option in the class-by-class list's level progression
sections tells you what you get as a 1^st^ level character when your
class abilities are a level lower.

### Talents as a 1^st^ level character

Choose one talent from each of your two class choices. Then choose your
third talent from either of those classes.

### Bonus talents as part of class progression

If your class gets bonus talents (barbarian, commander, fighter, monk,
occultist, paladin, ranger), you still get them, but at one level later
than a single-class character does.

### Class features

Many classes contribute all of their class features to a multiclass.
Others only allow some class features, or limit you from taking some
talents or feats. The details are in the class-by-class multiclass list.

### Ability score bonuses at character creation

You can select your ability score class bonus from the options available
to either of your classes. For example, if you are a fighter/wizard, you
can gain a single +2 class bonus to Strength, Constitution,
Intelligence, or Wisdom.

### Key ability scores & key modifiers

To be fully effective, multiclass characters have to be good in at least
two ability scores, generally one for each class.

A multiclass character uses a special modifier for most of their attacks
and other powers, called the *key modifier*. This modifier is the lower
of two ability modifiers determined by your particular class
combination. You use the key modifier whenever you would use either of
those two ability scores for an attack or an effect of powers or spells.

You don't necessarily use the key modifier for all attacks, only for
attacks that would normally use one of the two ability scores in
question. For example, a bard/cleric whose key modifier is Wis/Cha would
use that modifier for all their spell attacks based on Wisdom or
Charisma, but that character would still make cleric melee attacks with
Strength, and bard melee attacks with Strength too.

You **don't** use the key ability scores for skill checks. Skill checks
live outside the class framework and use your normal ability scores,
though if both scores are equal you will not notice the difference.

The Key Modifier table lists the modifier relevant to each multiclass
combination. For example, a rogue/wizard's primary abilities are
Dexterity and Intelligence, so that character's key modifier is the
lower of the character's Dexterity and Intelligence modifiers. You'll
use this key modifier in place of any Dexterity modifier or Intelligence
modifier you use for all attacks, powers, spells, and class features or
effects from the rogue or wizard class.

Core character stats like AC, PD, MD, and Initiative are not considered
elements of your class, so they use the normal ability modifiers rather
than the key modifiers.

### Basic attacks

You have the basic attacks from both your classes. If your ability
scores suggest that one of your basic attacks is better than the other,
each time you make a basic attack you'll have to specify which class you
are using.

### Hit Points

Your hit points are the average of the base HP of your two classes, +
CON modifier, multiplied by 3, then rounded down.

### Recovery dice

Average the dice from both classes, then round *up* to the next higher
die size (d6, d8, d10, or d12). For example: d6 + d8 = d8; d6 + d10 =
d8; d6 + d12 = d10; d8 + d10 = d10; d8 + d12 = d10; d10 + d12 = d12.

### Armor and AC

Use the highest base AC provided by either of your classes for whichever
type of armor you are wearing. However, you also retain the penalties
for wearing shields or heavy armor while using attacks and spells from
classes that have those penalties. For example, a 1^st^ level
wizard/fighter has a base AC of 16 in heavy armor from the fighter
class. But while the character's fighter attacks would be fine, any of
the character's wizard attacks (including spells) would take a --2
penalty.

### PD & MD

Use the best PD and MD from either of your classes.

### Weapon attacks

Use the better weapon attack abilities among your two classes.

### Weapon damage penalty

Most multiclass characters must drop all of their weapon damage dice
down one step. That means d12s become d10s; d10s become d8s; d8s become
d6s; d6s become d4s; and d4s stay as d4s. This reduction does **NOT**
apply if your multiclass contains *only* classes from the following list
of skillful warriors: barbarian, bard, commander, fighter, paladin,
ranger, or rogue.

If you're one of the many multiclass characters affected by the weapon
damage penalty, it applies only to your own attacks, not to the attacks
of animal companions, summoned creatures, and the like.

The reduction also applies when you've found a way to gain a larger
weapon damage die temporarily. For instance, a cleric casting the
*hammer of faith* spell would get to use d12 damage dice for the rest of
the battle, but a fighter/cleric (or any other cleric multiclass) would
have to use d10 damage dice with the spell.

### Feats

You can choose feats from either of your classes. You gain one feat per
level like everyone else.

### Gear

As a 1^st^ level character, you've got all the gear you need from both
your classes, as well as the normal starting gold pieces: 25 gp or 10 x
d6 gp.

## Key Ability Modifier

The important things to remember in keeping track of the key ability for
a multiclass character are a) the key modifier table itself is not
affected by any ability score swaps pulled off within class talents, and
b) the talents are class elements that are affected by the key ability
modifiers.

*Note:* Multiclasses that include only the barbarian, bard, commander,
fighter, paladin, ranger, and rogue classes don't take the weapon damage
die penalty suffered by other multiclass characters. The multiclass
ability scores of these combinations appear in italics above.

## Barbarian Multiclass

You get to start with three talents, but you don't get bonus talents
until 6^th^ level and 9^th^ level.

While raging, you cannot use attacks, powers, or spells from another
class unless you take Controlled Rage.

### Controlled Rage

#### Adventurer Tier

You can use powers and attacks from your other class while raging. You
can't use the extra d20 that Barbarian Rage gives you while making an
attack from the other class, but at least you can slip out of your rage
long enough to use a power or attack from your other class.

#### Champion Tier

Once per battle while raging, you can use a melee attack from your other
class as if it was a barbarian attack, rolling 2d20 for the attack.
(Examples of possible uses include a bard's flexible attack battle
cries, a commander attack using the Lead from the Front talent that will
garner command points, a fighter's flexible attacks, a ranger's double
melee attack, and so on.)

## Bard Multiclass

You lag one level behind in the battle cries and spells/songs known
columns of the Bard Level Progression table.

As a 1^st^ level bard, you start with only one 1^st^ level battle cry
and one 1^st^ level spell or song.

As usual, the Battle Skald or Spellsinger talents could still add a
battle cry or spell/song to what you're getting as a multiclass bard.

Note that the Jack of Spells advantages would only apply to spells
jacked by the talent, not to spells known through the multiclass.

If you multiclass with another class that has flexible attacks, such as
the fighter or a druid that takes that talent, consider the two feats
that follow. Without the feats, you must always declare whether you are
using a bard flexible attack or a flexible attack from your other class.

### True Flexibility

#### Adventurer Tier

Once per battle, as long as both classes use flexible attacks for the
type of attack you are making, you can choose to roll a flexible attack
without deciding which of your two classes it is linked to. Choose from
*all* your flexible attacks after you see the result of the roll.

#### Champion Tier

You can now use the adventurer-tier feat twice per battle.

## Chaos Mage Multiclass

You lag one level behind in the three central columns of the Chaos Mage
Level Progression table: daily spells, once-per-battle spells, and spell
level.

Drop three new stones of the same color (but a different color from your
attack/defense/iconic stones) into your chaos mage bag. These stones
correspond to your other class. When you draw one of the stones, any
warp effects or high weirdness you've got going on from a previous chaos
mage turn end. On your next turn, you must use a standard action attack
from your non-chaos mage class, just as if you had drawn a stone for one
of your standard three types of chaos magic.

If your chaos mage talents allow you to draft random spells from other
classes (Stench of Necromancy, Touch of Wizardry, Trace of the Divine,
and Whiff of Sorcery), those spells remain with the attack or defense
slots you assigned them to as usual.

### Continual Warp

#### Adventurer Tier

If you have a warp effect already going, drawing the stone from your
other class doesn't cancel the warp effect. The warp effect continues
until it's replaced by another warp effect or the end of the battle, as
usual.

#### Champion Tier

If you invested in high weirdness, your high weirdness effects don't
stop when you draw a multiclass stone.

## Cleric Multiclass

You lag one level behind in the spells known columns of the Cleric Level
Progression table.

As a 1^st^ level multiclass cleric, you start with three 1^st^ level
spells.

## Commander Multiclass

You lag one level behind in the class-specific elements of the Commander
Level Progression table---so it only affects the number of commands and
tactics you have and the pool you can draw them from.

### Many Fronts

#### Adventurer Tier

Once per battle, use a melee attack from your non-commander class in
place of a commander attack when you use your Front Line Fighting
feature.

#### Champion Tier

You can now use the adventurer-tier feat twice per battle.

## Druid Multiclass

You lag one level behind in the powers and spells known columns of the
Druid Level Progression tables.

## Fighter Multiclass

You lag one level behind two columns of the Fighter Level Progression
Table: Maneuvers Known and Maneuver Pool Available. You also won't get
the fighter's normal bonus talent at 6^th^ level, instead receiving it
at 7^th^ level.

As a 1^st^ level multiclass fighter, you start knowing two maneuvers
from the 1^st^ level pool.

### Armored Warfare

#### Adventurer Tier

Once per battle while wearing heavy armor, use an attack from a class
that normally takes an attack penalty while wearing heavy armor without
taking that penalty.

#### Champion Tier

You can now ignore heavy armor attack penalties while the escalation die
is 3+.

## Monk Multiclass

A multiclass monk does get a +2 class bonus to three abilities, but does
not get to use Focus abilities as the other class.

You lag one level behind in the three columns of the Monk Level
Progression table: class talents, forms, and ki.

The multiclass monk's JAB, PUNCH, and KICK attacks damage dice decrease
one size just like the WEAPON attacks of all classes. Yes, this means
your JAB dice are d4s, PUNCH dice are d6s, and KICK dice are d8s.

## Necromancer Multiclass

You lag one level behind in the spells known columns of the Necromancer
Level Progression table.

## Occultist Multiclass

You gain the focus required to use a serious occultist spell by using
your standard action during your turn to set that up. But when you have
your occultist focus, you don't get to use actions and powers and spells
from other classes.

You lag one level behind in the spells known columns of the Occultist
Level Progression table. You also won't get the occultist's normal bonus
talents at 5^th^ level and 8^th^ level, instead receiving them at 6^th^
level and 9^th^ level.

### Wider Focus

#### Adventurer Tier

Once per battle, you can use a power, spell, or other effect from a
different class while maintaining your occultist focus.

## Paladin Multiclass

You don't get the paladin's normal bonus talents at 5^th^ and 8^th^
level, instead receiving them at 6^th^ level and 9^th^ level.

### Armored in Life

#### Adventurer Tier

Once per battle while wearing heavy armor, use an attack from a class
that normally takes an attack penalty while wearing heavy armor without
taking that penalty.

#### Champion Tier

Two battles per day, avoid all attack penalties for wearing heavy armor
from a class that normally has such an attack penalty. During any other
battles that day, you can still only use the once-per battle power from
the adventurer-tier feat.

## Ranger Multiclass

Like the paladin, your Level Progression table doesn't have many
class-specific elements. You won't get the ranger's normal bonus talents
at 5^th^ and 8^th^ level, instead receiving them at 6^th^ level and
9^th^ level.

Unless you've multiclassed with one of the other skilled weapon-using
classes, your damage dice for the Double Melee Attack and Double Ranged
Attack talents drop down another size (usually from d6s to d4s) as a
multiclass ranger.

### Two-weapon Multiclass

#### Adventurer Tier

While you are fighting with two melee weapons, you now gain the benefit
of your Two-Weapon Mastery talent and any feats you've taken for it even
when using attacks from your non-ranger class.

#### Adventurer Tier

You can use your Archery ranger talent and any feats you've taken for it
even when using ranged attacks from your non-ranger class.

## Rogue Multiclass

You lag one level behind in the Powers Known and Pool Available columns
of the Rogue Level Progression table. At 1^st^ level, you know 3 powers,
all of them from the 1^st^ level pool.

Combining your Sneak Attack damage with attacks from other classes
remains off-limits.

### Seize the Momentum

#### Adventurer Tier

Once per day when you hit with an attack from your non-rogue class, you
can gain *momentum* as if you had used a rogue attack.

#### Champion Tier

In addition to using the adventurer-tier feat once per day, you can also
use it once per battle (so in a four-battle day, you could use it five
times).

## Sorcerer Multiclass

You lag one level behind in the spells known columns of the Sorcerer
Level Progression table. At 1^st^ level, you know three 1^st^ level
spells.

### Diverse Gathering

#### Adventurer Tier

Once per day, you can cast a non-sorcerer spell after you have gathered
power. You double the damage of the spell as if it were a sorcerer
spell.

#### Champion Tier

You can now also gather power for a non-sorcerer spell as per the
adventurer-tier feat once per battle while the escalation die is 4+ (so
in a four battle day, you could use it up to five times assuming the
escalation die allows it).

## Wizard Multiclass

You lag one level behind in the spells known columns of the Wizard Level
Progression table.

At 1^st^ level, you know four 1^st^ level spells.

# Combat Rules

Combat is played with various sided dice. You make attack rolls against
defense numbers and deal damage against hit points.

## Combat Stats

### Initiative Bonus

Your initiative bonus is your Dexterity modifier + your level.

### Attack Bonuses

For each attack, roll a d20 + an ability bonus + your level (+ magic
item attack bonus, if any). Depending on the attack, you might also get
other bonuses. Compare your total to the target's defense, usually Armor
Class but sometimes Physical Defense or Mental Defense. If the total is
equal to or higher than the defense, you hit. If you attack multiple
targets, make multiple attack rolls. Your class defines which ability
bonus you use on attack rolls, and the attack defines the effects of a
hit or a miss.

### Damage

Each attack indicates a specified amount of damage it does; subtract
that amount from the target's hit points. If the attack targets multiple
enemies, you make a separate attack roll for each one, but only roll
damage once.

Damage totals for your attacks are calculated by adding one ability
score modifier to the attack's damage roll, normally represented by
saying "+ Ability."

Calculate the ability modifier subtracting 10 from the ability score,
halving the result, then rounding down.

At 5^th^ level, double the ability score modifier before adding to the
damage roll for all attacks. (Negative modifiers get are doubled too).

At 8^th^ level, triple the ability score modifier.

Spells indicate a specific number of dice to roll for damage. Weapon
attacks work differently.

### Weapons

Weapons are rated by how much damage they deal. In the hands of player
characters, each weapon attack deals 1 die of damage per character
level + ability modifier, notated as WEAPON + \[Ability\].

Each class has its own version of the weapon chart, showing how well
members of the class use weapons of a given damage category.

### Other Damage Types

Different monsters and characters may be resistant or vulnerable to
various types of damage, including:

-   Acid

-   Cold

-   Fire

-   Force

-   Holy

-   Lightning

-   Negative energy

-   Poison

-   Psychic

-   Thunder (sonic energy)

### Defenses

There are three different defenses: Armor Class, Physical Defense, and
Mental Defense. Each uses three ability scores as part of its
calculation. PCs also add their class level to their defenses.

#### Armor Class (AC)

AC protects you from weapon attacks. It is equal to the middle value
among Con, Dex, and Wis. Disregard the higher and the lower values.

#### Physical Defense (PD)

PD protects you from other physical attacks. It is equal to the middle
value among Str, Con, and Dex. Disregard the higher and the lower
values.

#### Mental Defense (MD)

MD protect you against mental attacks. It is equal to the middle value
among Int, Wis, and Cha. Disregard the higher and the lower values.

### Hit Points

Hit points are based on class, Con modifier, and level. See the level
progression chart for each class.

### Speed

If it's important to know who covers ground faster, the GM determines
how to make the "speed check" by using either common sense or stats and
skills.

### Stacking Rules

Bonuses and effects to a single stat stack with each other, with these
exceptions:

-   Magic item bonuses don't stack. Only the best one counts.

-   Many condition penalties don't stack. Only the worst one counts.

-   Powers, spells, and abilities don't stack with themselves or with
    other game elements with the same name. This works for both PCs and
    monsters.

## Combat Sequence

At the start of combat, each player rolls initiative for his or her
character and the GM rolls for their opponents, with higher-rolling
characters or enemies acting earlier each round.

### Cyclic Initiative

#### Roll Once

Each creature rolls to determine its initiative at the start of its
first turn in battle (d20 + initiative bonus). Use those results to
determine who goes first each round.

All monsters of the same exact type share the same initiative roll.

#### Delay

By choosing to delay, you take no action and then act normally on
whatever initiative count you decide to act. When you delay, you
voluntarily reduce your own initiative for the rest of the combat. Your
initiative result becomes the count on which you took the delayed
action.

If you come to your next action and have not yet performed an action,
you don't get to take a delayed action (though you can delay again).

If you take a delayed action in the next round, before your regular turn
comes up, your initiative count rises to that new point in the order of
battle, and you do not get your regular action that round.

#### Readying an Action 

The ready action lets you prepare to take an action later, after your
turn is over but before your next one has begun. Readying is a standard
action.

You can ready a standard action, a move action, or a free action. To do
so, specify the action you will take and the conditions under which you
will take it. Then, any time before your next action, you may take the
readied action in response to that condition. The action occurs just
before the action that triggers it. If the triggered action is part of
another character's activities, you interrupt the other character.
Assuming he is still capable of doing so, he continues his actions once
you complete your readied action. Your initiative result changes. For
the rest of the encounter, your initiative result is the count on which
you took the readied action, and you act immediately ahead of the
character whose action triggered your readied action.

Your initiative result becomes the count on which you took the readied
action. If you come to your next action and have not yet performed your
readied action, you don't get to take the readied action (though you can
ready the same action again). If you take your readied action in the
next round, before your regular turn comes up, your initiative count
rises to that new point in the order of battle, and you do not get your
regular action that round.

### Actions on Your Turn

#### Standard, Move, and Quick Actions

Each turn you can take one of each action, in any order. See Combat
Actions.

##### Free Actions

You can take any number of free actions on your turn, as allowed by the
GM. Creatures can also take free actions when it's not their turn as
part of a triggering condition. Talking is a free action.

##### Make Saves Last

If you are subjected to an ongoing effect that requires a save, roll
that save at the end of your turn, after the ongoing effect.

### Escalation Die

The escalation die represents a bonus to attacks as the fight goes on.

At the start of the second round, the GM sets the escalation die at 1.
Each PC gains a bonus to attack rolls equal to the current value on the
escalation die. Each round, the escalation die advances by +1, to a
maximum of +6.

Monsters and NPCs do not add the escalation die bonus to their attacks

If the GM judges that the characters are avoiding conflict rather than
bringing the fight to the bad guys, the escalation die doesn\'t advance.
If combat virtually ceases, the escalation die resets to 0.

## Combat Actions

### Actions

#### Regular Actions

On your turn, you can take one standard action, move action, and quick
action, and a handful of free actions, in any order.

You can use a standard action to take a move action, and you can use a
standard or move action to take a quick action.

#### Interrupt Actions

You can use one interrupt action when it's not your turn. You can't use
another one until the end of your next turn. These types of actions are
limited to certain classes and class powers.

#### Other Actions when it's Not Your Turn

In certain circumstances, characters can intercept foes moving past
them, make opportunity attacks, or otherwise act out of turn. These
actions are usually free actions.

### Position

A creature's position amounts to two things: the creature's whereabouts,
and who it's contending with in melee.

#### Whereabouts

Each creature has a general, relative position on the battlefield.
Combat is dynamic and fluid, so miniatures can't really represent where
a character "really is."

#### Nearby

Generally, all the heroes and their enemies in a battle are nearby. That
means they can reach each other with a single move action.

#### Behind

If you're behind an unengaged ally, and an enemy moves past that ally to
get to you, your ally has the option to move and intercept.

#### Intercepting

You intercept a creature when you move to stop an enemy attempting to
rush past you to attack someone else. You must be near the enemy and the
person that enemy is trying to reach.

#### Faraway

Generally, the heroes and their enemies are nearby each other and you
can use a single move action to reach any of them (provided no enemy
intercepts you). If you want to be faraway, two moves away from the
enemies, make that clear to the GM and make sure there's room for that
maneuver. Wizards and other casters sometimes like to be faraway.

#### Engaged/Next to

In a battle, each combatant is either engaged (locked in combat with one
or more enemies) or unengaged (free). When two allies are engaged with
the same enemy, they are considered next to each other.

### Movement and Melee

The combat system cares about movement and position, but only in
simple/approximate terms. It emphasizes where people are and who's
fighting whom.

#### Free

By default, characters in a battle are free. They can move freely, use
ranged attacks, engage in battle, etc. If they try to move past a free
enemy, however, that foe usually has the option to intercept them.

#### Engaged

Characters are engaged when they are in melee with foes. Engaged
creatures can use melee attacks and close-quarter spells against the
creatures they engage. They can use ranged attacks but doing so draws
opportunity attacks from the enemies that are engaging them that they
don't attack, as does moving away from the enemies they're engaged with.

Unengaged creatures have no particular limits on how they move. They
can't use melee attacks until engaged.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Disengaging

You can move away from the foes that engage you, but you draw an
opportunity attack from each of those enemies when you do.

If you don't want to risk an opportunity attack, you can use your move
action to attempt to disengage (a disengage check). If you choose to
disengage, roll a normal save (11+). You can disengage from more than
one foe with a single successful check, but your roll takes a --1
penalty for each foe beyond the first that you are disengaging from.

If the disengage check succeeds, you can move without drawing
opportunity attacks from the foes you were engaged with. Use your move
normally.

If you fail the disengage check, you don't move, lose your move action
for that turn, and remain engaged. You don't take any opportunity
attacks.

Disengaging uses a move action. If you succeed, it's like getting popped
free at the start of your move. If you fail, you use up the move action
to no effect.

When a creature gets to make an opportunity attack, it can make a basic
melee attack against that foe as a free action during the turn of the
creature that is provoking the opportunity attack. You can only use a
basic melee attack.

#### Intercepting

If you move past someone who is not already engaged, they have the
option to engage you and make you stop where they are. The GM rules on
what counts as moving "past" a defending character or enemy.

#### Targeting

Important stats for targeting should be transparent to PCs. The GM
should tell you whether your targets are legal targets, or whether
they're mooks, normal monsters, or large monsters.

A spell or area-style effect that targets multiple nearby enemies in a
group can't skip over enemies. You pick one target and attack the rest
in order; you don't skip all over the battlefield. Spells that say they
target multiple nearby enemies but don't specify that they have to be in
a group are capable of sending magical energy in different directions,
allowing spellcasters to choose targets from where they like.

When a spell or power targets a nearby enemy, ally, or creature, you
can't target yourself unless it is explicitly stated that you can also
be a target.

#### Special Cases

Here are rules for special situations involving movement and melee.

##### Allies

Powers and spells in various classes are written with the understanding
that a character's allies are the other PCs in the party with a possible
addition for an animal companion. NPCs don't count as allies for
abilities that are counting the number of allies that meet certain
conditions.

##### Ambushes and Surprise

In situations when one side ambushes or surprises the other, start by
letting the ambushing side pick one creature who will start the ambush.
Then roll initiative for all members of the ambushing side.

Only two creatures get to act in the ambush round: the nominated
ambusher and their highest initiative ally. The GM can choose whether to
advance the escalation die after the surprise round.

Then roll initiative for the side that got ambushed and play normal
combat rounds.

##### Dicey Moves

If it's questionable whether a character could execute a particularly
interesting move during combat, make a skill check against the ability
score that the action is going to use. Specify whether a background will
help. The DC depends on the current environment and the dice tell the
tale.

## Special Actions

Here are a few things you can do that are more involved than just moving
or attacking.

### Flying

Some classes have spells or talents that enable *flight*. The movement
rules for *flight* are the same as for other movement, except that, as
long as there is space available, you can fly over enemies you're not
engaged with without allowing them to take opportunity attacks against
you. You can be intercepted only by other flyers that are already
airborne.

The engagement and disengagement rules are also the same when flyers
make melee attacks against enemies on the ground. The player may choose
to swoop past another flyer, as part of another attack, instead of
engaging it directly, at a -2 attack penalty.

### Fight in Spirit

This is a special combat action that you can take when you are out of
the fight altogether. Once a round you can specify how your character is
still there "fighting in spirit" alongside the other party members. Come
up with some story about what your character has done that could boost
party morale. The GM may grant any ally a +1 bonus to attacks, Armor
Class, Physical Defense, or Mental Defense. The first time each battle
that someone fights in spirit may be a +2 bonus.

The bonus lasts one to two rounds. If the fight is still on and you have
something else to add to the story, sell it to the GM.

If you're still (even partly) in the fight, then you can't fight in
spirit.

### Flee

Fleeing is a party action. On any PC's turn, any player can propose that
all the characters flee the fight. If all players agree, they
successfully retreat, carrying any fallen heroes away with them. The
party suffers a campaign loss. The point of this rule is to encourage
daring attacks and to make retreating interesting on the level of story
rather than tactics.

### Rally

Once a battle, every PC can use a standard action to rally, spending one
of their recoveries and regaining hit points they've lost in combat.
(See Recoveries.)

If you want to rally again later in the same battle, make a normal save
(11+). If you succeed, you can rally again that round using another
standard action. If you fail the save, you can take your turn normally,
but you can't rally that round.

## Attacks

Most attacks follow the general attack rules, except as indicated below.

### General Attack Rules

When you use an attack, you declare which attack you are using and pick
its target or targets, then roll the d20 for each one to find out if you
hit. The attack will indicate what happens to a target that you hit (and
sometimes one that you miss).

#### Ranged Attacks

Any ranged attack (weapon, spell, power, ability, or whatever) draws
opportunity attacks from enemies engaged with you that you don't target
with the attack.

#### Spell Attacks

Most spells draw opportunity attacks from enemies engaged with you, even
the enemies you target with the spell. Close-quarters spells are the
exception; they don't draw opportunity attacks.

Like weapon attacks, you add your level to the attack roll for spell
attacks, plus any magical implement or other bonuses you might have.

#### Target Hit Points

Some spells and effects target creatures with a certain number of hit
points or less. The hit point value you use is based on current hit
points, not starting hit points.

### Crits

Every attack roll that is natural 20 is a crit ("critical hit") for
double damage.

#### Crit Effects

Standard crits deal double damage and, at the GM's discretion, might
entail some additional superior result.

If you manage to double your crit damage (through the effect of a
talent, power, spell or other source), triple it instead. If you manage
to double your triple damage, bump it up to quadruple, and so on.

#### Crit Range

Crit range is what you must roll to score a crit. The standard crit
range is a natural 20. Some powers and spells expand your crit range.
Each point of improvement drops the number needed to score a critical
hit by 1.

### Fumbles

Rolling a natural 1 has no effect on the target, not even miss damage.
At the GM's discretion, rolling a 1 while in a precarious position might
entail a bad result for the attacker. You might also hit an ally if
you're shooting into melee.

### Damage on Miss

By default, a miss deals no damage, though some attacks are an
exception. These attacks specify what happens on a miss. Unless
otherwise stated, damage modifiers do not apply to misses.

### Flexible Attacks

*Flexible* attacks allow you choose your target first, make your attack
roll, and then use the natural unmodified die result to determine which
of your eligible flexible attacks to use. You still use the modified
roll to determine whether or not you hit, but your flexible attacks
trigger off the natural result on the die sitting in front of you.

You can only use one flexible attack at a time.

You can't use a flexible attack when you make an opportunity attack.

If you have some attacks that are flexible and some that are not,
declare whether you are making a flexible attack or a specific
non-flexible attack before you roll.

### Unarmed Attacks

To punch or kick, make a Strength attack with a --2 penalty (regardless
of your class) against AC. If you hit, you deal 1d6 damage for every two
levels you have, plus your Strength modifier. At odd levels, including
1^st^ level, use a d3. If you miss, no damage.

### Two-Weapon Fighting

You fight as normal, generally using the weapon in your main hand to
attack. If your attack roll is a natural 2, you can reroll the attack
but must use the reroll.

You do not get an extra attack for fighting with two weapons.

Some classes (and class talents) provide other advantages when fighting
with two weapons. Those classes still get to use this basic two-weapon
advantage.

## Damage and Healing

Damage and healing affect hit points. Healing also involves
*recoveries*.

### Damage

Every creature has hit points. You slay enemies (or occasionally knock
them out) at 0 hp. PCs at 0 hp begin using the Death and Dying rules.

### Recoveries

Each PC starts the adventure with 8 or 9 recoveries, a stat that
represents the PC's ability to heal or bounce back from damage. Many
healing spells and potions require you to use up a recovery. So does
rallying during a battle.

When you use a recovery, regain lost hit points by rolling recovery dice
equal to your level and adding your Constitution modifier. Your class
indicates which recovery die to use.

At 5^th^ level, double the bonus you get from your Con modifier. At
8^th^ level, triple it.

If you perform an action that requires a recovery but have none left,
you get half the healing you would otherwise get and take a --1 penalty
to all defenses and attack rolls until your next full heal-up. This
penalty stacks for each recovery used that you don't possess.

### Staggered

When you are reduced to half your hit points or fewer, you're
*staggered*. Some powers, spells, and monster interactions work
differently when you are staggered.

In general, monsters become staggered when they take damage equal to
half their hit points or more, but it's up to the GM.

### Unconscious

When you drop to 0 hp or below, you fall unconscious. You can't take any
actions until you're conscious again, though you do make a death save at
the start of each of your turns. (See Death and Dying.)

When monsters drop to 0 hp, it means they've been slain, unless the
characters' intent is to keep the monster alive and the attack seems
like a potentially humane blow that could knock the monster unconscious
instead.

## Death and Dying

When you drop to 0 hp or below, you fall unconscious and can't take any
actions (except to make death saves).

To make a death save, roll a d20 at the start of your turn. If you roll
16+, use a recovery to return to consciousness and heal up to the number
of hit points you rolled with your recovery. If you roll a natural 20,
you get to take actions normally that turn. If you roll 15 or less, you
take one step toward the grave. After the fourth failed death save in a
single battle, you die.

You also die when you reach negative hit points equal to half your
maximum hit points.

If you're able to use one of your recoveries (or otherwise get healed)
while you are dying, ignore your current negative hit points. Start from
0 and add the hit points you've regained.

If one of your allies is unconscious and you don't have magic to heal
them, you can still stabilize them to keep them from dying. Get next to
them and make a DC 10 healing skill check using Wisdom as a standard
action. Failure wastes your standard action, but doesn't hurt your
friend. Success stabilizes your ally. If your stabilization check is
25+, you treat their wounds so quickly that it only takes a quick
action; you can use your standard action normally that turn.

A stabilized character is still unconscious, rolling death saves on
their turn, but failed death saves no longer take them a step closer to
death. Ignore failed death saves while stabilized.

Feeding a dying character a healing potion gets them conscious and back
on their feet, but always takes a standard action.

### Optional Lasting-Wound Rule

If you're dropped to 0 hp or below one or more times during a fight, you
take a lasting-wound. Each lasting-wound reduces your maximum hp by an
amount equal to 2 + your level. Lasting-wounds are cumulative.
*Staggered* is still half or less of your maximum hit points. A full
heal-up removes all lasting-wounds.

### Optional Meaningful Death Rule

PCs can only be fully slain by named villains. PCs who fail four death
checks fall into a coma and can only be brought back to consciousness
once they're fully out of danger.

## Rest and Recharge

After each battle, you can use a quick rest to get ready for the next
battle. After four battles, you'll usually earn a full heal-up.

### Quick Rests

When you take a quick rest, you can choose to heal yourself by using as
many recoveries as you have available.

If you are staggered when you take a quick rest, you must try to heal
yourself, either with a recovery or from a spell that provides some true
healing.

For each recharge power that you used in the last battle, roll a d20 to
see if you keep the power for your next battle or lose it until after
your next battle. You have to roll the power's recharge value or higher
to use it again.

### Full Heal-ups

After approximately four battles, characters earn a full heal-up, though
the exact number is determined by the GM. Tougher battle can mean more
frequent heal-ups, and vice versa.

After a full heal-up, your hit points reset to full. You regain any
recoveries you've used. All expended powers are regained or recharged.
("Daily" powers are actually "per heal-up.")

If the party is short of a heal-up but is too beat up to press on, they
can retreat and take a full heal-up, which entails a campaign loss. (See
Flee.)

## Combat Modifiers

The universal combat modifier is +2 when you have advantageous
circumstances. Similarly, --2 is the right penalty for adverse
situations.

### Shooting into Melee

When using a ranged attack to target an enemy that is engaged with one
or more of your allies and you fumble (roll a 1), reroll that attack
considering the engaged ally as the target. If there are multiple
allies, the GM rules which ally is the target.

### Invisibility

Invisibility grants a big modifier to any stealth skill checks---at
least +5 unless you're dealing with creatures who can detect you without
sight.

Once engaged in battle, attacks against invisible enemies have a 50%
chance to miss completely, before the attack roll. Attacks that miss in
this fashion don't deal any damage or have effects on the invisible
creature, though other effects on a miss might occur.

## Special Attacks and Effects

### Conditions

You can only be affected by the same condition once at a time. The worst
one affects you and the lesser effects are ignored. Similarly, penalties
from these conditions don't stack.

#### Confused

You can't make opportunity attacks or use your limited powers. Your next
attack action will be a basic or at-will attack against any nearby ally,
determined randomly.

#### Dazed

You take a --4 penalty to attacks.

#### Fear

Fear dazes you and prevents you from using the escalation die.

#### Hampered

You can only make basic attacks. You can still move normally.

#### Helpless

If you're unconscious or asleep, you're helpless. While helpless, you
take a --4 penalty to all defenses and you can be the target of a coup
de grace.

#### Stuck

You can't move, disengage, pop free, change your position, or let anyone
else move you without teleporting.

#### Stunned

You suffer a --4 penalty to defenses and can't take any actions.

#### Vulnerable

Attacks against you have their crit range expanded by 2 (normally 18+).

#### Weakened

You take a --4 penalty to attacks and to defenses.

### Coup de Grace

When you attack a helpless enemy you're engaged with, you score an
automatic critical hit if you follow these three steps:

-   Skip your move action and your quick action that turn.

-   Make a standard action attack on your turn against the helpless
    enemy you are engaged with.

-   Your attack only targets the helpless enemy, even if the attack
    would normally target multiple creatures.

### Grabbed

Some monsters grab you. Generally they grab you after a successful hit.
A creature can let go of a creature it is grabbing as a free action.

When you're grabbed you are engaged with the creature grabbing you and
you can't move away unless you teleport, somehow pop free first, or
successfully disengage. Disengage checks take a --5 penalty unless you
hit the creature that is grabbing you the same turn that you're trying
to disengage.

If you are smaller than the creature that is grabbing you, it can move
and carry you along with no problem. If you are the same size or larger,
it has to let go of you if it wants to move.

Grabbed creatures can't make opportunity attacks. That also applies if
the creature grabbing you decides to let go and move away from you; it
doesn't have to disengage or take an opportunity attack from you, it
just leaves you behind.

Grabbed creatures can't use ranged attacks, although melee and close
attacks are fine.

The creature grabbing you gets a +4 attack bonus against you.

### Ongoing Damage

A creature (including PCs) taking ongoing damage takes that damage at
the end of its turn immediately before it rolls its save (11+ unless
otherwise specified) against that ongoing damage. Success with the save
means the creature won't take the damage again; failure means the effect
will be repeated at the end of the creature's next turn.

Once a battle is over, the PCs automatically make their next saves.

### Saves

The save mechanic, a d20 roll with no standard modifiers, handles
everything from power recharge to saves against power effects to death
saves. There are three difficulty values for saves. If a save doesn't
specify what type it is, it's a normal save: 11+.

-   **Easy:** Roll 6+ on a d20

-   **Normal:** Roll 11+ on a d20

-   **Hard:** Roll 16+ on a d20

There are no standard bonuses to saves, but there are occasional
talents, feats, and magic items that provide small bonuses to saves.

### Resistance

Resistance to types of damage is rated as a number corresponding to the
attacker's natural d20 roll. The higher the number, the more resistance
you have.

When an attack with a damage type you are resistant to targets you, the
natural attack roll must equal or exceed your resistance number to deal
full damage. If the roll is lower than your resistance, the attack deals
half damage.

If you take ongoing damage of a type you resist, use the original attack
roll to determine whether you take the full amount of ongoing damage or
half the amount (rounded down).

Any creature with resistance to an energy type is immune to normal
energy of that type. Magical attacks, magical weapons, and spells are
different: the damage they do can get past the resistance. This
resistance = immunity rule only applies to energy types, not to weapons.
Weapon resistance does not mean immunity to non-magic weapons.

If there's an automatic damage effect that feels like it should have a
chance of being reduced by resistance, fake an attack roll to see if the
effect penetrates resistance for full damage or only deals half.

### Situational Weapon Use

When the action in the story backs it up, at the GM's discretion, a
weapon's normal dice can be swapped for bigger or smaller dice, letting
the character roll the same damage dice of a larger or smaller weapon.
This is an optional rule in for memorable situations.

### Teleportation

Teleportation is an effect by which a creature moves instantaneously
from one location to another. Teleporting doesn't draw opportunity
attacks, but casting the spell may; spellcasting rules don't change
because you are casting a teleport spell.

### Temporary Hit Points

Temporary hit points are beneficial effect that keeps a character from
harm. When you gain temporary hit points, keep track of them separately
from your regular hit points. Temporary hit points don't stack; when you
gain more temporary hit points while you still have temporary hit points
left, use only the higher amount and ignore the lower amount.

When you take damage, subtract it from your temporary hit points first,
and only apply damage to your regular hit points after the temporary hit
points are used up.

Temporary hit points reset to 0 after a battle and drop to 0 when you
roll initiative.

# Running the Game

This section has instruction for the GM on running the game.

## Using Icon Relationships

For basic icon relationship rules, see Icon Relationships.

As a GM, use a PCs' icon relationships three different ways: for
starting a session, for in-game dramatic events, and for discovery and
surprise.

### Rolling Relationships at the Start of a Session

All players roll their PC's icon relationship dice at the start of each
session, and everybody sees the results. As usual, rolling a 6 with an
icon die provides an unambiguous advantage. Rolling a 5 provides a
similar advantage, but the benefit is balanced by complications and
obligations that advance the story. By the end of the session, each 6 or
5 should contribute to the story somehow, either at the GM's or player's
initiative.

The GM uses the results to think ahead about which icons come to the
fore this session. Players use the results to start thinking about how
their icon relationships might manifest in the story.

As GM, you bear most of the burden of improvising story elements based
on the PCs' icon relationship results. Your players may have great
suggestions, but it's on you to weave them together with the story
elements and battles you have already prepared...or are planning to
improvise on the spot.

#### Rolling New Story-guide Dice Mid-session

Story events and talents can create new icon relationships in the middle
of play. Allow players to roll newly acquired icon dice right away as if
they'd had them at the start of the session.

### Icon Relationship Rolls as Dramatic Events

Players roll all of their relationship dice for a particular icon when
their PCs are confronting that icon's representatives, agents, or
minions. The GM decides when an event-based roll is called for.

Story-guide rolls should occur most every session. Event-based rolls
rise out of circumstances during play.

It's never the player's choice to roll icon relationship dice for
dramatic events. When new circumstances and dramatic events force or
suggest interactions or confrontations with forces or situations
associated with a particular icon, the GM can call for an icon
relationship roll as a shorthand guide to the dramatic results of the
situation.

#### Rolling a 5 with Icon Events

Getting a 5 on an icon relationship check moves the story forward, just
like a 6 does, but it also generates a complication. A 5 means both good
and bad results. The negative result might be secret, it might be
delayed, and it might be nothing more than a promise until you figure
out what it really means.

### Discovery & Surprise

At the GM's option, players may roll icon relationship dice to find out
which icons are involved in a plot element, if any. When the characters
have slalomed onto paths and adventures you did not anticipate, icon
relationship rolls can serve as an idea generator with mechanics that
everyone already understands.

Discovery dice aren't interpreted as positively as other icon
relationship rolls. You're using the icon dice more to determine whether
an icon has a stake in what's involved, not necessarily whether the
situation is going to work to a PC's advantage.

You'll probably use this style of roll most often when the characters
have gone off your map, chasing enemies you hadn't anticipated, seeking
treasures you referred to earlier without having a clear idea about, and
taking forest paths you hadn't been aware existed. GMs who enjoy being
surprised by new developments may opt for discovery rolls before
improvising the consequences of the PCs' unexpected steps.

Using icon relationship rolls from one or more characters keeps the new
developments relevant to the players and possibly relevant to the
overarching plot.

## Environments

Any place in the game world that a player might want to make a skill
check is an environment, of which there are three tiers: adventurer,
champion, and epic.

Adventurer environments are for level 1-3 characters: city streets,
wilderness areas, shallow dungeons, regular old ruins, and that sort of
thing.

Champion environments are for level 4-6 characters: deeper dungeons,
danker swamps, guarded gates of the big cities, and those sorts of
places.

Epic environments are for level 7+ characters. They are typically
related to icons, unique villains, deep underworld locations, the most
forbidding peaks, the upper reaches of the world, and so on.

The GM determines the environs where the adventure takes place.

### Environment Chart by Level

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Level        Type of Environment
  ------------ ----------------------------------------------------------
  1--3         Always adventurer

  4            Mostly adventurer, some champion

  5            Half adventurer, half champion

  6            Mostly champion, some adventurer

  7            Mostly champion, some epic

  8            Half champion, half epic

  9            Mostly epic, some champion

  10           Always epic
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Environment DCs for Skill Checks

The environment the PCs are in determines the DC of skill checks and
other challenges they may face.

#### Adventurer-tier Skill Check DCs

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Task                                                  DC
  ----------------------------------------------------- -----------------
  Normal task                                           DC 15

  Hard task                                             DC 20

  Ridiculously hard task                                DC 25
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Champion-tier Skill Check DCs

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Task                                                  DC
  ----------------------------------------------------- -----------------
  Normal task                                           DC 20

  Hard task                                             DC 25

  Ridiculously hard task                                DC 30
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Epic-tier Skill Check DCs

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Task                                                  DC
  ----------------------------------------------------- -----------------
  Normal task                                           DC 25

  Hard task                                             DC 30

  Ridiculously hard task                                DC 35
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Impromptu Damage

When you need to determine how much damage some effect deals, use the
chart below, basing the damage on two things: the environment, and
whether the damage affects one character or many.

### Traps & Obstacles

As shown in the chart below, attack rolls for traps and other features
of the environment follow the same mathematical model as DCs for skill
checks.

Use the skill check DC on the table to give you a general guideline for
PCs attempting to disarm a trap (once they notice that there is a trap).
Failure means the trap will trigger.

### Skill Check DCs, Trap/Obstacle Attacks & Impromptu Damage by Environment

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Building Battles

For adventure tier, levels 1-4, start with one enemy creature of the
party's level per PC. At champion tier, levels 5-7, start with one enemy
creature per PC, with each creature being one level higher than the PCs.
At epic tier, levels 8--10, the monsters should weigh in at two levels
above the PCs if they appear in equal numbers.

Lower-level monsters count as fractions of an adventurer-level monster,
and higher-level monsters count as multiples. See the monster
equivalents chart below.

### Mooks

At champion and epic tier, it takes 5 mooks to equal one standard
creature. At first and second level, use 3 mooks as a standard creature
if the mooks are the same level, an equivalent of .33. At third and
fourth level, use up to four mooks per monster, or .25.

### Large Monsters

A large (or double-strength) monster counts as 2 standard monsters.

### Huge Monsters

A huge (or triple-strength) monster counts as 3 standard monsters.

### Monster Special Abilities

When you use monsters with especially nasty special abilities, be aware
of the increased threat that they represent and take that into account.

### Unfair Encounters

To make the battle more difficult, consider outfitting the monsters in
the battle with these features:

-   Potent powers

-   Nastier specials

-   Weight of numbers

-   Reinforcements

-   Advantageous terrain

## Full Heal-ups

A party should get a full heal-up after approximately 4 regular battles,
3 hard battles, or 2 regular battles and 1 very hard battle.

For storytelling, try to sync full heal-ups with an appropriate event in
the game world.

If the PCs find some special source of healing when they don't deserve a
full heal-up yet, allow them to get one or two recoveries back and to
make some extra recharge rolls.

If the party is able to rest and decides to heal-up ahead of time, they
suffer a campaign loss. The story moves along, but the situation in the
campaign gets noticeably worse for the party (at the GM's discretion).

## Leveling Up

Characters advance a level after three or four full heal-ups, i.e.
between twelve and sixteen serious battles. The whole party levels up
together.

### Benefits of Leveling Up

When you level up, you get these benefits:

-   +1 to attacks, defenses, and skill checks.

-   An additional die of damage with weapon attacks.

-   More hit points (by class).

-   An additional feat. Choose any feat whose prerequisites your
    character satisfies. Feats are classed as adventurer (can be chosen
    at any level), champion (can be chosen at level 5+), and epic (can
    be chosen at level 8+).

-   The ability to wield an additional magic item. (See Magic Item
    Personalities & Quirks.)

-   At 4^th^ level, 7^th^ level, and 10^th^ level, you add +1 to three
    different ability scores.

-   At 5^th^ level and 8^th^ level, gain an additional icon relationship
    point, and possibly more talents depending on your class.

-   Possibly more powers and spells, and possibly an increase in their
    strength. (See Classes.)

### Incremental Advance

After each session that goes well, the GM awards the players an
incremental advance.

When you gain an incremental advance, choose one of the traits of your
next level to receive immediately (if available) instead of waiting
until you level up. You're not stuck with your choice, however, once you
do level up.

You can take each incremental advance only once (except power/spell, see
below). The advancement choices are:

#### Ability Score Bonuses

As a 4^th^-, 7^th^-, or 10^th^-level incremental advance, you can choose
+1 in three of your ability scores.

#### Feat

Choose a feat. For the purposes of this feat, your level is one higher
than normal. When you level up, you can switch this feat out for another
feat of your choice.

#### Hit Points

Your maximum hit points increase as if you were one level higher. If
you're presently damaged while mid-adventure, your current hit points
increase by the same amount.

#### Magic Item

You can wield an additional magic item as if you were 1 level higher.

#### Power or Spell

Choose a single power or spell that you could take at your next level.
If you have a choice of multiple powers or spells, then you can take
this increment multiple times to match. If you must replace a
lower-level spell with a higher-level spell, you cannot replace a spell
that has been expended.

#### Skills

Add +1 to all skill checks.

#### Talent

If your class gains a new talent at the next level, you can take that
talent as an incremental advance at 4^th^ or 7^th^ level.

#### Icon Relationship Points

As a 4^th^ or 7^th^ level incremental advance, with the GM's permission,
you can choose a new icon relationship point that you would get at 5^th^
or 8^th^ level.

#### No Attack or Defense Bonuses

You only get these bonuses when you level up.

## Loot: Treasure Rewards

Use the guidelines that follow to decide how many gold pieces and magic
items to reward to successful adventurers.

The majority of treasure reaches the PCs one of two ways (a) as loot
from climactic battles, or (b) as rewards after or before an adventure
from a PC's icon connections.

### Gold Piece Rewards

The table below lists the highest amount of gold pieces you should
consider awarding to each character in the course of an adventuring day.
Rewarding less gold is fine.

#### GP per Full Heal-Up

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  PC Level                  GP per Character
  ------------------------- ---------------------------------------------
  1                         100

  2                         125

  3                         175

  4                         210

  5                         250

  6                         325

  7                         425

  8                         500

  9                         650

  10                        850
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Optional No Math System

Each player rolls a d20 and checks the table below. Results are not
cumulative; what you roll is what you get.

##### Loot per Heal-Up

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Roll     Loot
  -------- ---------------------------------------------------------------
  1--2     Useless stuff, fake potions, costume jewelry, nothing gained.

  3--4     One healing potion, lower tier.

  5--10    One healing potion from PC's tier.

  11--15   Two potions/oils/runes of PC's choice from PC's tier.

  16--20   Three potions/oils/runes of PC's choice from PC's tier.
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Rituals

Rituals are spells cast outside of combat for various free-form magical
effects. Clerics and wizards learn ritual magic by default; other
spellcasters can learn it by taking the Ritual Casting feat.

### Casting a Ritual

To cast a spell as a ritual:

1.  Choose the spell that will be used and expended by the ritual.

2.  Tell the GM what you are trying to accomplish and gather necessary
    ingredients for the ritual.

3.  Spend 1d4 minutes/quarter-hours/hours (as determined by the GM)
    preparing and casting the ritual. You can't cast other spells during
    this period. A PC taking damage won't necessarily end the ritual,
    but it will be ruined if a character falls unconscious or launches
    an attack of their own.

4.  Make a skill check using one of your magical backgrounds and the
    ability score the GM deems appropriate. Use the standard DC targets
    (or a special DC set by the GM), depending on your tier and the
    results you're hoping for. The higher the level of the spell
    consumed by the ritual, the greater the effect.

No matter the outcome, the spell is expended until your next full
heal-up.

### Determining Results

Choose outcomes that are outgrowths of the spell's normal effects. The
effects don't have to play within the usual constraints of the magic
system, and they don't have to be taken as a precedent for future
rituals.

Failure should fail forward.

The Ritual Magic (champion-tier) feat of the wizard allows you to cast a
ritual in a matter of rounds instead of minutes, but it still needs the
required components.

# Monsters

You can use the monsters included in the *13^th^ Age* Archmage Engine,
or you can make your own.

## Monster Rules

### Stats & Characteristics

Most monster attacks generally deal a specific amount of damage (instead
of rolling for damage) and don't add on the escalation die. Only
exceptional monsters get to add the escalation die to their attacks.

Monsters may have particular abilities or powers that are triggered when
the attack roll is greater than a certain threshold. The default trigger
happens at a 16+ monster d20 attack roll, though unpredictable monsters
may have effects trigger on other rolls.

#### Mooks

Mooks are weaker monsters that can be cut down in large numbers in a
single turn. Damage is not tracked against single mooks, but against the
entire mob of mooks you're facing. If you roll damage against a mook and
it is greater than the single mook's hit points, then another mook takes
the remainder. In this way, damage can cascade to multiple mooks, and a
player can kill multiple in one turn, even if they're not all directly
within your attack range.

A mook's hit point value is one-fifth that of a regular monster.

Mooks move and attack individually. Mooks deal a fixed damage when they
hit, and double damage when they roll a natural 20.

Mooks can be split up into multiple mobs with different initiative
numbers and hit point pools for each.

#### Large & Huge Monsters

Large monsters generally have twice the hit points and deal roughly
double the damage of a normal-sized monster. They also count as two
monsters when you build a battle.

Huge monsters have triple the hit points, deal triple damage, and count
as three normal-sized monsters when you're putting together a battle.

Regular-sized monsters may also have the same stats as large and huge
monsters, in which case they are labeled as double-strength and
triple-strength monsters, respectively.

#### Dire Animals

Dire animals are bigger (large-sized) versions of normal animals. Dire
animals usually have at least one dire feature, determined randomly
using the table below.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  d6   Dire Feature   Description
  ---- -------------- ------------------------------------------------------
  1    Armor plates   Add +2 to the dire animal's AC, and add +1 to its PD.

  2    Spiky bits     Whenever an enemy hits the dire animal with a melee
                      attack, deal damage equal to twice the animal's level
                      to that attacker.

  3    Carnage        The dire animal's attacks that miss deal damage equal
                      to its level. When staggered, its missed attacks deal
                      damage equal to double its level.

  4    Poison         The dire animal's main attack also deals 5 ongoing
                      poison damage per tier (5 ongoing poison at levels
                      1--4, 10 at 5--7, etc.).

  5    Dire           When the escalation die is even, this animal heals
       regeneration   damage equal to triple its level at the start of its
                      turn.

  6    Fury           While staggered, the dire animal gains a +2 attack
                      bonus and deals +4 damage, but at the end of each of
                      its turns it takes 2d6 damage.
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Abilities

Monsters may have special abilities for use in battle.

#### Burrowing

Burrowing is a special rule for monsters that allows somewhat restricted
movement underground. Unless otherwise specified, monsters generally do
not leave functional tunnels behind them when burrowing.

A burrowing creature on the surface may attempt to burrow underground by
using a standard action. Burrowing is successful if a saving throw beats
the required save for the type of ground.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Type of Ground                       Difficulty       Save Needed
  ------------------------------------ ---------------- -----------------
  Sand, dirt, forest soil              Easy             6+

  Hard-packed dirt, loose rocks        Normal save      11+

  Rock, caves, dungeon floors          Hard save        16+
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

After successfully burrowing, a creature may move underground, faster or
slower depending on the hardness of the ground, out of sight of other
creatures, hidden and safe from attacks.

For breaking through to the surface, the sequence is as follows: a move
action from deeper under the ground to come close to the surface, close
enough that people see there's something coming, followed by a quick
action to break through, and then by a standard action attack.

#### Death Attacks and Last Gasp Saves

Some deadly monsters have a special attack called a *death attack* that
can kill (petrify, paralyze, liquefy, immolate) in a single attack. Such
attacks offer the player a *last gasp save*.

A player that is affected by a death attack has a limited amount of last
gasp saves to try to throw off the condition of the death attack. On the
first turn a player is affected, the player may make a single action
(standard, move, or quick), after which they must roll a hard save
(16+). If successful, the player shrugs off the death attack condition
and can act normally on their next turn. If unsuccessful, their turn
ends and the player is now helpless and cannot take any other actions on
future turns except for further last gasp saves. Each successive last
gasp save is a hard save (16+). A successful save means that the player
can act normally on the next round, unless the player rolls a natural 20
for their last gasp save, which means that the player can take their
turn normally in the current round.

Once a player fails four last gasp saves while fighting off the death
attack, the death attack effect succeeds, and the player is adversely
affected as the attack indicates.

An ally may assist a player affected by a death attack. The ally must
use a standard action to help the player shake off the attack. This
gives the player a free last gasp save that may be rolled immediately.
(A failure doesn't count against the four allowed saves.) In addition,
the assisted save becomes normal difficulty (11+) instead of hard.

#### Fear

Some monsters may have an aura of fear that makes them more difficult to
be attacked.

A character engaged with such a monster must have a certain amount of
hit points (according to the level of the monster with the fear aura) or
be dazed (-4 attack) and gain no benefit from the escalation die.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Level              Fear threshold (HP)
  ------------------ ----------------------------------------------------
  0                  7

  1                  9

  2                  12

  3                  15

  4                  18

  5                  24

  6                  30

  7                  36

  8                  48

  9                  60

  10                 72

  11                 96

  12                 120

  13                 144

  14                 192
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Should the character's hp increase past the fear threshold or the
character disengage from the monster, they lose the dazed effect and
regain the escalation die benefits.

### Group Abilities

A few monsters have limited abilities that can be used a certain number
of times in a battle for the group. Any monster within that group may
use the ability, but then the number of available uses is decremented
for the entire group. It does not matter which monster uses the ability.

Mooks cannot have group abilities.

### Leveling Up

Use these guidelines to raise an existing monster by one or more levels.

1.  Raise its attack bonuses and defenses by 1 per added level.

2.  For damage, hp, and related special abilities (like healing),
    multiply the monster's stats accordingly:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Levels Added                   Damage Multiplier
  ------------------------------ ----------------------------------------
  +1 level                       x 1.25

  +2 levels                      x 1.6

  +3 levels                      x 2.0

  +4 levels                      x 2.5

  +5 levels                      x 3.2

  +6 levels                      x 4.0
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Size/Strength and Level

These are the key stats that determine how tough a battle will be using
the creature. Sizes are regular, large, and huge. Regular-sized monster
can have double-strength (2x) and triple-strength (3x). Regular-sized
and regular-strength monsters are labeled as normal.

### Role

Monsters with different roles still use the same stats.

#### Archers

Archers are ranged attackers who use weapons rather than spells.

#### Blockers

Blockers have abilities that help them protect their allies.

#### Casters

Casters are magician-types who need space to cast their spells properly.
They're capable of anything.

#### Leaders

Leaders have abilities that help other monster allies fight better.

#### Mooks

Mooks are minor monsters that are good cannon fodder. (See Mooks.)

#### Spoilers

Spoilers mess the PCs up with attacks that inflict harmful effects
instead of or in addition to hit point damage.

#### Troops

Troops are the default monster type that aim to hurt PCs via hit point
damage.

#### Wreckers

Wreckers really bring the pain. Enemy groups containing only wreckers
will be very dangerous to the PCs.

### Type

Some spells and magic items care about monster type. A ranger with a
favored enemy type definitely cares about it.

Types include aberration, beast, construct, demon, dragon, giant,
humanoid, ooze, and undead.

### Initiative, AC, PD, MD, HP

See Combat Stats.

### Attack

The default attack is a melee attack against one target that requires a
standard action to use. If an attack can target more than one creature,
that information follows the attack value.

When a monster makes an opportunity attack, it must use a melee attack.
If that attack action normally includes multiple attacks, it can make
only one attack roll.

The abbreviation **R:** indicates that an attack is a ranged attack
instead of a melee attack. The default ranged attack assumes a single
nearby target, but some can hit faraway targets as well, which is noted
in the targeting information or extra effect trigger.

The abbreviation **C:** refers to close-quarters attacks that can be
used without triggering opportunity attacks from engaged enemies like
ranged attacks do. Each close-quarters attack will note its targets.

Some attacks can only be used when the natural roll triggers it. These
attacks have a *\[Special trigger\]* indicator at the start of the
attack line. Other triggers allow a monster to use a normal standard
action attack as a free action.

### Extra Effect Trigger

Many monster abilities trigger randomly based on the monster's attack
roll. Not all attacks have triggers. Most extra effect triggers are
natural even or odd attack rolls or other specific die rolls, but a few
are more unusual.

### Specials

These are other attacks and special abilities like *fear* or movement
abilities like *flight*. Not all monsters have them.

Some monsters have nastier special abilities that increase a monster's
options and help keep monsters interesting throughout the campaign. Use
them as options whenever you like.

## Monster Reference

### Animal/Critter

For dire animal abilities, see Dire Animals.

All bats have the following abilities:

-   *Echolocation:* Bats rely on sound waves to sense their
    surroundings. A bat can "see" in total darkness, and can detect
    creatures using invisibility or visual illusions to hide.

-   *Flight:* Small bats fly quickly and turn easily. Bigger bats fly
    more awkwardly.

-   *Wall-crawler:* A bat can climb on ceilings and walls as easily as
    it moves on the ground.

### Battle Shade

Treat the battlefield effects that follow as a big nastier special.

[Against The Pcs]{.underline}

Until all battle shades have been reduced to 0 hit points, select one of
the following effects at the start of each round.

-   Half-formed hands of mud and dirt reach out of the ground, grasping
    at the legs and feet. Make the following attack against 1d3
    non-flying creatures.

    -   **+7 vs PD**---The target is stuck until the start of their next
        > turn.

-   A literal fog of war (smoke, fog, blowing dust, etc.) covers the
    area. Ranged attacks from non-battle shade creatures have a --4
    penalty.

-   Broken and shattered weapons erupt out of the ground. Choose up to
    three characters in a group. Those players must roll a normal (11+)
    saving throw or take 2d10 damage.

-   Wild necromantic energy bursts like a geyser from the earth with a
    scream of pain and fear from dozens of spectral throats. Target 1d3
    characters with the following attack.

    -   **+6 vs MD**---4 damage and the target is dazed until the end of
        > their next turn.

-   Blood begets blood. As the characters are beaten and injured, the
    accumulated pain and blood revitalizes the battlefield and the
    battle shades. The first time a character becomes staggered or any
    time one drops to 0 hit points, add a broken shade mook to the
    fight. Add it to an existing mob if possible.

[Counteractions]{.underline}

Player characters expecting to deal with battle shades can take
precautions.

-   Ritual casting certain spells like the cleric\'s *turn undead* or an
    appropriate Terrain Caster spell from the druid could return the
    battle area to normal for the duration of the battle.

    -   Players may think to try this during combat instead of
        > beforehand. If they do so, they should make a normal (11+)
        > saving throw at the beginning of each round. If they succeed,
        > the battlefield effect is suppressed. If they fail, it
        > activates like normal that turn.

-   The obvious icon relationship advantages that could help are the
    Religious and Undead Icons, but players may be able to justify
    others. A six, along with a bit of a description should nullify the
    battlefield effects. A five would nullify the effect but create some
    other complication; for example, summoning the attention of the
    Undead Icon's servants!

### Briar Elf

[Environmental Effects]{.underline}

Before the battle, roll a d4 to determine which environmental effect
will show up during the fight. Then roll a d3 for the minimum escalation
die value that triggers the effect at the start of the round and stays
in effect the rest of the battle.

In the unlikely event that PCs have managed to find or lure briar elves
outside the briar elf's forested places of power, these effects probably
wouldn't apply.

[Humanoid Briar Elves]{.underline}

**1. Snares**---Enemies who take more than two actions on their turn
while on the ground must save (11+) or be whipped into mid-air by a
snare trap and hung upside-down (stuck & --2 attack penalty), it is a
standard action to free oneself or an ally. (GM: Choose how many snares
you want set before the fight, probably the number of PCs plus or minus
1.)

**2. Pit traps**---The briar elves have created spike-lined pits
disguised with forest-floor litter. If you roll a natural 1--5 on d20
roll you must save (11+) or become stuck (move action to end) and take
your level × d6 damage.

**3. Blowdarts**---More briar elves are lurking on the edge of the
fight, just out of sight. If a PC rolls lower than the escalation die
value on any natural d20 roll they take poison damage equal to their
level.

**4. Gruesome display**---The whirl of battle has revealed some fresh
corpses desecrated by the briar elves and impaled in the trees. Story
consequences are best here: it can be someone the PCs cared about.

[Plant Briar Elves]{.underline}

**1. Grasping grasses**---Disengage checks by non-plant creatures and
non-briar elves take a --5 penalty.

**2. Cutting leaves**---Adventurers must save (11+) when they move or
take damage equal to twice their level.

**3. Crushing vines**---Any adventurer who doesn't move on their turn
takes their level in damage.

**4. Thorny plants**---Each time an adventurer becomes staggered they
also take damage equal to their level times the escalation die value.

[Undead Briar Elves]{.underline}

**1. Whispers of the past**---PCs have a --2 penalty to MD and PD, as
overlapping ghostly whispers cause pain and anxiety.

**2. Ghostly terrain**---On rounds when the escalation die is odd the
PCs are stuck, unable to move due to ghost trees that suddenly block
their paths.

**3. Spectral hands**---PCs take a --1 penalty to attack rolls, as
ghostly thorn-pierced hands grab at them.

**4. Fearful destiny**---PCs who could normally resist fear effects
cannot do so for the duration of this battle. PCs who cannot normally
resist fear take a --2 penalty to their saves whenever they are affected
by fear.

|          | PC rolls one icon relationship die of their      | * |   |
|          | choice and one die chosen from their             |   |   |
|          | relationships by the GM. A roll of 6 means the   | * |   |
|          | chimera has shifted in a manner that gives it a  | * |   |
|          | chimerical flaw (F) that the adventurers can     | H |   |
|          | exploit. A roll of a 5 indicates that the        | P |   |
|          | chimera gains both a flaw and a benefit          | * |   |
|          | associated with that icon. A result of 1 or 2    | * |   |
|          | means that the chimera gains the icon's          |   |   |
|          | chimerical benefit (B) without the flaw. Actual  |   |   |
|          | benefits and flaws are up to the GM, and should  |   |   |

|          | effect and the chimera heals 40 hp.              |   |   |

|          | 1s against the chimera count as 2s.              |   |   |

|          | **(B)** *Mane of scorpion tails:* The chimera    |   |   |
|          | has a *fear aura*: Enemies engaged with the      |   |   |
|          | chimera who are below 48 hit points are dazed    |   |   |
|          | and can't use the escalation die.                |   |   |

|          | yield 1d6 × 100 gp per adventurer in gems and    |   |   |
|          | precious metals. At the GM's say-so, knowledge   |   |   |
|          | of this bounty may grant particularly mercenary  |   |   |
|          | characters a +1 attack bonus against the chimera |   |   |
|          | once it's staggered.                             |   |   |

|          | **(B)** *Inferno belly:* When the chimera makes  |   |   |
|          | a *fiery breath* attack, it can make another     |   |   |
|          | *fiery breath* attack that turn as a quick       |   |   |
|          | action.                                          |   |   |

|          | **(F)** *Flammable blood:* When the chimera      |   |   |
|          | rolls a natural odd miss with *fiery breath*, it |   |   |
|          | takes 20 fire damage.                            |   |   |

|          | **(B)** *Wild heart:* The chimera is constantly  |   |   |
|          | evolving and changing. When an enemy rolls a     |   |   |
|          | natural 1--5 on an attack roll against it, the   |   |   |
|          | chimera adds the escalation die to its attack    |   |   |
|          | rolls until the end of its next turn.            |   |   |
|          |                                                  |   |   |
|          | **(F)** *Vulnerability, poison:* The crit range  |   |   |

|          | natural even miss with a melee attack against    |   |   |
|          | the chimera, the weapon temporarily loses all    |   |   |
|          | its bonuses and powers and the wielder is        |   |   |
|          | weakened (save ends both).                       |   |   |

|          | **(B)** *Mighty tusks:* As a standard action,    |   |   |
|          | the chimera can make a *tusk charge* attack. It  |   |   |
|          | can't make any other attacks the same turn.      |   |   |
|          |                                                  |   |   |

|          | the chimera lock together at inopportune         |   |   |

|          | is engaged with one or more enemies and is the   | P |   |
|          | target of an attack, it can try to interpose one | * |   |
|          | of those enemies between itself and the attack   | * |   |
|          | as a free action after seeing the attack roll.   |   |   |
|          | That enemy rolls a normal save; on a failure, it |   |   |
|          | becomes the target of the attack instead of the  |   |   |
|          | chuul. If the chuul tries to interpose an enemy  |   |   |
|          | it's grabbing, the save is hard (16+) instead.   |   |   |

|          | targets this creature, the attacker must roll a  |   |   |
|          | natural 16+ on the attack roll or it only deals  |   |   |

|          | engaged with the chuul at the start of its turn, |   |   |
|          | that creature must roll a normal save; on a      |   |   |
|          | failure, it's hampered (easy save ends, 6+).     |   |   |

|          | *Extra claw:* The mutant chuul can make three    |   |   |
|          | *crushing claws* attacks instead of two. If two  |   |   |
|          | of the attacks hit the same target, the chuul    |   |   |

that no longer exist should be given whichever ability or attack that
seems right. Alternatively, make up a new ability/attack that suits the
former icon you've created.

Here are some Icon-centered abilities:

| *Natural even miss:* The target is weakened (save ends).              |
|                                                                       |
| *Natural odd miss:* 35 damage.                                        |

| *Limited use:* 1/battle, when the escalation die is 2+.               |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Zealous Icon                                                          |
|                                                                       |
| The couatl gains a +1 bonus to AC and PD. In addition, all the        |
| couatl's melee attacks deal half damage when they miss.               |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Demonic Icon                                                          |
|                                                                       |
| Roll a d6 and a d8 on the Demon Ability table. If you get the same    |
| result, reroll the d8 until you have two *different* demonic          |
| abilities for the couatl.                                             |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Underground Icon                                                      |
|                                                                       |
| Secretly roll a d6 at the start of each battle. If the roll is odd,   |
| the PCs can't use any of their magic items' powers when the           |
| escalation die is odd this battle. If the roll is even, the PCs can't |
| use their magic items' powers when the escalation die is even this    |
| battle. Default chakra bonuses still function, but powers don't. And  |
| for the fun of it, once they've been powered off for a turn, all the  |
| PCs' magic items will be freaking out and creating roleplaying havoc  |
| by forcing their quirks to the forefront for the rest of the battle.  |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Graceful Icon                                                         |
|                                                                       |
| At the start of each battle, the couatl gains 1d4 powers of its       |
| choice from this list:                                                |
|                                                                       |
| *Cruel:* Once per battle, deal ongoing damage to a target you hit     |
| with a natural even attack roll as a free action. The ongoing damage  |
| equals 5 times your level. As usual, a normal save (11+) ends the     |
| damage. A critical hit doesn't double this ongoing damage.            |
|                                                                       |
| *Highblood Teleport:* Once per battle as a move action, place         |
| yourself in a nearby location you can see.                            |
|                                                                       |
| *Elven Grace:* At the start of each of your turns, roll a die to see  |
| if you get an extra standard action. If your roll is equal to or      |
| lower than the escalation die, you get an extra standard action that  |
| turn. At the start of battle, you roll a d6. Each time you            |
| successfully gain an extra action, the size of the die you roll       |
| increases by one step on the following progression: (d4), d6, d8,     |
| d10, d12, d20. If you get an extra action after rolling a d20, you    |
| can't get any more extra actions that battle.                         |
|                                                                       |
| *Surprising:* Once per battle, subtract one from the natural result   |
| of one of your own d20 rolls.                                         |

| The couatl gains a +4 bonus to MD. It also gains a +2 bonus to        |
| attacks and to all defenses against each PC who has one or more icon  |
| relationship points with the Undead or Brute Icons.                   |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

| The couatl gains a +1 bonus to attacks and to all defenses against    |
| each PC who has one or more icon relationship points with the Demonic |
| or Draconic Icons. In addition, the couatl can use the following      |
| attack once per battle.                                               |

### Demon

Demons may or may not have a special demonic ability. Roll 1d10 for each
non-mook normal-sized demon. If you roll less than or equal to the
demon's level, it has a random ability. Large or huge (or double- or
triple-strength) demons automatically get one at least one random
ability.

When a demon has an ability, roll 1d6 or 1d8 (GM's choice) on the table
below to determine what it is.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  d6   Demonic        Description
  or   Ability        
  d8                  
  ---- -------------- -------------------------------------------------------
  1    True seeing    The demon is immune to invisibility and ignores any
                      illusions.

  2    Resist fire    You'll see that the demon resists fire the first time
       18+            you use fire against it.

  3    Invisibility   The first time the demon is staggered each battle, it
                      becomes invisible until the end of its next turn.

  4    Resist energy  The demon\'s resistance to all energy types puts a
       12+            damper on enemy spellcasters, but at least the
                      resistance is only 12+.

  5    Fear aura      Enemies engaged with the demon who are below its fear
                      hit point threshold are dazed and can't use the
                      escalation die. See Fear.

  6    Teleport       1d3 times per battle, as a move action, the demon can
                      teleport anywhere it can see nearby.

  7    Demonic speed  The demon can take an extra action each turn while the
                      escalation die is 4+.

  8    Gate           Once per battle as a standard action, if the demon is
                      staggered, it can summon a single demon ally at least
                      two levels below its own level. The allied demon rolls
                      initiative and does not appear on the battlefield until
                      its turn starts.

|           | does not have an icon relationship with the       |   |   |
|           | Demonic Icon, the character must shift one        |   |   |
|           | relationship point with another icon into a       |   |   |
|           | conflicted relationship with the Demonic Icon.    |   |   |

|           | knowledge drawn from the Demonic Icon or their    |   |   |
|           | spells rather than from the wizard. If the        |   |   |
|           | questioner has a negative relationship with the   |   |   |
|           | Demonic Icon, it becomes conflicted; if the       |   |   |
|           | relationship is conflicted, it becomes positive.  |   |   |
|           | If the PC does not have an icon relationship with |   |   |

|           | *The Demonic Icon's blessing:* Once per battle as |   |   |

|           | grant one nearby player character a random        |   |   |
|           | demon-style power from the table below. The       |   |   |
|           | blessing only takes effect if the character       |   |   |
|           | accepts it, but the character can choose to       |   |   |
|           | accept the blessing at any point this day, in     |   |   |
|           | this or another battle. If the blessing is        |   |   |
|           | accepted, *the Demonic Icon's blessing* affects   |   |   |

|           | *1. Resist energy 16+*---When an attack that      |   |   |
|           | deals energy damage targets you, the attacker     |   |   |
|           | must roll a natural 16+ on the attack roll or it  |   |   |
|           | only deals half damage.                           |   |   |

|           | *2. Fear aura*---Enemies engaged with you that    |   |   |
|           | have fewer hit points than double your current    |   |   |
|           | hit points are dazed. If they could normally use  |   |   |

|           | standard action each turn that the escalation die |   |   |
|           | is even. You lose 2d6 hit points each time you    |   |   |
|           | use the extra action.                             |   |   |

|           | Demonic Icon cult area (or some other evil marsh  |   |   |
|           | or cursed area!) who has a 5 or 6 icon advantage  |   |   |
|           | with the Demonic Icon can spend it to summon a    |   |   |
|           | Demonic Icon wizard to their location. The        |   |   |
|           | Demonic Icon wizard teleports next to the         |   |   |
|           | summoner, and acts on the turn immediately after  |   |   |
|           | the summoner's to either answer a question with   |   |   |
|           | the Demonic Icon's knowledge or perform *the      |   |   |
|           | Demonic Icon's blessing* on a nearby ally. After  |   |   |
|           | doing so, it teleports away.                      |   |   |
|           |                                                   |   |   |

|           | Icon wizards after the PC's first battle against  |   |   |
|           | a Demonic Icon wizard. If used on a character who |   |   |
|           | already has a positive relationship with the      |   |   |
|           | Demonic Icon, the PC gets another such point,     |   |   |

### Devil

Although devils vary between campaigns, they need to retain certain key
elements. Devils:

-   Come from somewhere unearthly.

-   Embody evil.

-   Act through stealth, calculation, and guile.

-   Covertly interfere in mortal affairs.

-   Respect power and hierarchy---theirs, if no one else's.

-   Are clearly distinguishable from demons.

-   Have horns.

Devils have a unique ability called *devil's dues*. Player characters
that attack a devil don't automatically get to use the escalation die.
If you want to add the escalation die to your attack, you have to decide
before rolling the attack to give the devil its due. Each type of devil
(except for those with the *weakling* ability) will specify what it gets
when you give it its due. Note that an attack that targets more than one
devil would require multiple devil's due decisions and trade-offs.

Devils have other special abilities that can be picked randomly or
purposely. Choose 0 to 2 abilities per devil. Some abilities may be
conditional. For example, a devil may only get a special ability while a
boss devil is commanding them.

  d10   Devil Ability Description
  ----- ------------- ------------------------------------------------------
  1     Alternative   Change the *resist fire 13+* ability to a different
        element       element, e.g. lightning or acid.

  2     Beast form    This rare special ability lets a devil pass unnoticed
                      through populated areas, though with a tell-tale sign
                      that it's preternatural, such as a big cat that looks
                      normal except for its forked tongue. Changing forms is
                      a move action.

  3     Devilish      The devil gains a +4 bonus to saves.
        resilience    

  4     Fear          The devil gains fear aura. Players with fewer hit
                      points than double the devil\'s current hit points are
                      dazed. They cannot use the escalation die.

  5     Final-gasp    When the devil drops to 0 hp, it stays up until its
        strike        turn, at which point it can take one last standard
                      action before dropping. The devil will drop without
                      getting that last action if it takes enough damage to
                      reduce its hit points to negative 25% of its starting
                      hp.

  6     Humanoid form This rare special ability lets the heroes meet a pit
                      fiend over dinner and not know it until too late.
                      Changing forms is usually a move action.

  7     Resist        The devil resists the effects (but not the damage) of
        non-damage    attacks with a natural attack roll of 12 or less.
        effects       Ongoing damage isn't affected by this ability. If the
                      attack deals energy damage that the devil is resistant
                      to (like fire), that damage is halved as normal. This
                      ability is tied to a devil's energy resistance number,
                      so if you increase that number for a devil with this
                      ability, the non-damage range also increases.

  8     Summon other  This ability is better used as a conditional feature
        devils        of a particular battle than as a standard special
                      ability. On the first round of battle, a group of
                      devils keens eerily, and everyone knows they're
                      summoning something, but no one knows exactly what, or
                      when it will show up.

  9     True seeing,  Powerful devils might have the ability to see through
        see invisible simple ruses and illusions.

  10    Unearthly     If a devil takes X damage or less, negate that damage.
        toughness     Bigger blows have full effect, but petty blows are
                      beneath the devil's notice. Set X at the devil's
                      level + 1. It will be immune to normal miss damage
                      from enemies that are its level or lower. Or set X at
                      5% of its starting hit points to have the value scale
                      up faster at higher levels.

#### Skin Devil

|           | *Stay whole:* At the start of its turn, a skin    | * | 6 |
| Troop     | devil heals 8 hp. If it doesn't heal up to its    | * |   |

|           | *Structural collapse:* While the skin devil is    | P | 2 |

|           | additional 4 hp as the hapless thing fails to     | * |   |
|           | hold its boneless, bulky mass together.           | * |   |

|           | *Weakling:* When building battles using this      | * |   |
|           | monster, it only counts as half a normal monster. | * |   |
|           |                                                   | M |   |
|           | *Free-form covert ability---Unnoticed:* The skin  | D |   |
|           | devil is routinely able to pass through civilized | * |   |
|           | areas without alerting dogs, bouncers, city       | * |   |
|           | guards, or passersby. If the thing attacks,       |   |   |
|           | that's when you notice that it's not a human but  | * |   |
|           | a monstrous pile of flesh. In addition to passing | * |   |
|           | unnoticed in crowds, it uses its fluid shape to   | H |   |
|           | sneak through hidden places, and it doesn't make  | P |   |
|           | much noise unless it wants to. PCs looking for    | * |   |
|           | the devil won't find it unless they have some     | * |   |
|           | special information or advantage, and even then   |   |   |
|           | it's a ridiculously hard check (DC 25). Normally  |   |   |
|           | when PCs think they have the devil cornered, it   |   |   |
|           | escapes through a tight exit that it had          |   |   |
|           | previously identified.                            |   |   |

#### Lemure

|           | *Devil's due (Squirm):* When you choose to add    | * | 5 |
| Mook      | the escalation die to an attack against a lemure, | * |   |
|           | another lemure in the mob somehow ends up in an   |   | 1 |
| Devil     | unwanted place in the battle, though it's hard to | * | 7 |
|           | say how exactly. They don't seem to teleport, but | * |   |
|           | there are so many of the things squirming around  | P | 1 |
|           | it just happens.                                  | D | 3 |
|           |                                                   | * |   |
|           | *Living wave:* When three or more lemures engage  | * |   |
|           | an enemy, they can pick it up and move it along   |   |   |
|           | with them as they please without taking           | * |   |
|           | opportunity attacks. The enemy getting moved      | * |   |
|           | around pops free of any other enemies engaged     | M |   |
|           | with it.                                          | D |   |
|           |                                                   | * |   |
|           | *Nobody home:* When a lemure is targeted by an    | * |   |
|           | attack against MD, it ignores any effects of the  |   |   |
|           | attack and only takes damage from it. In          | * |   |
|           | addition, lemures fight in a straightforward way, | * |   |
|           | without tactics. They never disengage willingly,  | H |   |
|           | and they're not coordinated enough to concentrate | P |   |
|           | attacks on a vulnerable target.                   | * |   |
|           |                                                   | * |   |
|           | *Resist fire 13+:* When a fire attack targets     |   |   |
|           | this creature, the attacker must roll a natural   |   |   |
|           | 13+ on the attack roll or it only deals half      |   |   |
|           | damage.                                           |   |   |

|           | *Free-form ability---Mass:* Heedless of each      |   |   |
|           | other's safety or their own, lemures use sheer    |   |   |
|           | numbers to press through locked doors, climb      |   |   |
|           | walls, or dog pile on defenders.                  |   |   |
|           |                                                   |   |   |

|           | *Too dumb to die:* At the start of the lemure     |   |   |
|           | mob's turn, roll a d6 for each lemure in the mob  |   |   |
|           | that's dropped this battle. For each 6, one of    |   |   |
|           | them reassembles its horrid self and stumbles     |   |   |
|           | back into the melee that turn (add 13 hit points  |   |   |
|           | to the mob's hp total). To make sure a downed     |   |   |
|           | lemure is truly dead, an attacker can spend an    |   |   |
|           | additional 7 damage of the total dealt to finish  |   |   |
|           | the job instead of carrying that damage over to   |   |   |
|           | another lemure in the mob. Expending the right    |   |   |
|           | sort of limited-use power, such as a daily spell, |   |   |
|           | might also keep a number of downed lemures        |   |   |
|           | totally dead. Once the last member of the mob     |   |   |
|           | drops, stop rolling to see if lemures rise up.    |   |   |

|           | *Weakling:* When building battles using this      |   |   |

|           | *Free-form covert ability---Slimy:* In any        |   |   |
|           | non-combat struggles with a honey devil, it       |   |   |
|           | excels at being too slippery for the PCs, both    |   |   |
|           | personally and through its underground network of |   |   |
|           | minions. In an indirect contest, the PCs might    |   |   |
|           | try to talk sense to one of the devil's dupes or  |   |   |
|           | to discern suspicious activity while staking out  |   |   |
|           | the devil's secret network. The honey devil is an |   |   |
|           | expert at what it does, so use DC 25 for any such |   |   |
|           | skill checks. Assume that the devil is competent  |   |   |
|           | at slipping its influence through the network     |   |   |
|           | unnoticed. Failure might mean that the PC has     |   |   |
|           | succeeded in gaining information, which in turn   |   |   |
|           | sends them down a dead end or into a trap. In a   |   |   |
|           | direct confrontation, the devil is likewise hard  |   |   |
|           | to pin down, see through, or otherwise get the    |   |   |
|           | better of.                                        |   |   |
|           |                                                   |   |   |
|           | A slime devil seems unremarkable and innocuous,   |   |   |
|           | so downplay its significance whenever describing  |   |   |
|           | it, especially when it has company. When mortals  |   |   |
|           | actually decide to attack or capture a honey      |   |   |
|           | devil, it's probably slippery enough to escape at |   |   |
|           | the last minute, maybe through a hidden exit.     |   |   |

#### Fury Devil (Erinyes)

[Hellbent]{.underline}

Fury devils become hellbent against a creature for story reasons outside
the scope of a single battle. PCs could give devils ample reason to hate
them. Or a succession of 5s as relationship dice with icon interactions
that involve the devils might suffice to make the fury devil hellbent.
More often than not, it won't be one of the PCs who is the target, but
getting in the way of hellbent furies is a problem. They will try to
bypass defenders, however, to concentrate on killing their target or
targets.

Typically, a single fury devil leaves the Pit to exact retribution. If
heroes manage to beat that erinyes back, then three new fury devils rise
up to try to finish the mission that the first one failed at, and
whoever killed the first erinyes is on their hit list, too. If those
devils fail, five erinyes come next, with another hero added to their
list. If stout-hearted heroes defeat all five fury devils, they're safe.
Maybe.

### Devil, Fang

Fang Devil is a singular river creature. The first time the heroes
encounter the devil, it should be a 7^th^ level monster. If the PCs slay
the devil near water, you may foreshadow that the devil will be back as
a multiplicity of 10^th^ level river devils. In 13^th^ Age, threats
don't necessarily die the first time you deal with them. In the case of
Fang Devil, it's a localized threat within one river at a time at 7^th^
level. When it becomes a multiplying group of 10^th^ level creatures, it
could spread out wherever the campaign requires it.

### Devil, Hubris

[Nastier Specials for all hubris devils]{.underline}

*Friend or enemy?:* A hubris devil using NPCs to attack the heroes makes
it tough for them to know if there are friends or allies among the
attackers, forcing the characters to be more careful with their attacks.
Any natural 1--5 attack roll against the devil is an automatic miss with
no miss damage.

*Surprise!:* When the hubris devil attacks, it gains a surprise round
unless the PCs were extremely perceptive (by making a ridiculously hard
skill check for tier).

*Final-gasp soul snatch & escape:* When the devil drops to 0 hp, it
appears dead until the start of its next turn, at which point it will
attempt to steal a piece of the soul of the closest character before it
escapes into a supernatural bolt hole. That character must roll a save.
If they fail, they lose a chunk of their soul---see below for possible
effects. Anyone who uses a coup de grace on the devil before its next
turn will slay it before it can claim a chunk of a soul and escape (but
the PCs might not be aware of this).

**Effects:** What does it mean to have a chunk of your soul stolen.
You're free to come up with complications that suit your campaign's
metaphysics or take the suggestions that follow as a starting point. Use
one or more, as you choose.

-   Magic items no longer work for the affected character, even ones
    already attuned to them, and in a similar vein, no new items can be
    attuned by that PC.

-   The PC loses access to their highest level of spells or powers. For
    example, a cleric who normally casts 7^th^ level spells could only
    cast them at 5^th^ level.

-   The PC takes a --2 penalty to saves.

-   The PC must roll 2d20 for attack rolls and take the lowest result
    for the first two rounds of each battle.

-   The PC's appearance changes in some disturbing, hollow way and they
    take a --4 penalty to skill checks.

-   PC loses one to three recoveries; not temporarily, their ability to
    heal decreases.

-   One icon relationship changes to become a sign of complications with
    devils, not advantages.

-   Devils gets some huge combat advantage against the PC.

**Restoration:** Similarly, you can choose how the missing piece of soul
might be restored. Some examples:

-   No big deal: the PC rolls a normal save each time they gain a level.
    If the save succeeds, they get their soul back.

-   The party must find and kill the escaped hubris devil. Luckily, the
    PC's 'link' to the devil means that each day the PC can roll a
    normal save; on an 11+, they have a good idea of which direction the
    devil is in. And hubris devils don't move all that much.

-   Instead, the party must travel to the center of the devils' power
    and steal back their friend's soul shard. Or whatever it is that you
    think their particular soul piece is gonna look like.

-   The devils immediately barter the soul shard to an enemy icon,
    leading to an entirely new set of quests and complications.

### Dragon

All dragons have two standard abilities: *escalator* and *flight*. The
escalator ability allows the dragon to add the escalation die to its
attack rolls. The flight ability allows the dragon to fly---fairly well,
and quickly in a straight line, though not as maneuverable as more agile
fliers.

Dragons have a breath attack. Unlike most close attacks that target a
number of enemies, dragon breath attacks don't care about whether the
targets are in a group.

Young dragons are medium-sized. Adult dragons are usually large sized.
Huge-sized dragons are the exception, and have usually outgrown the
vulnerabilities of their weaker kin.

Some metallic dragons inspire debilitating awe in their enemies. The
*inspire awe* ability is similar to *fear*, but it's not fear, so its
effect can combine with the dazed condition. Enemies at a hit point
threshold or lower take a --4 penalty to limited attacks (attacks that
aren't basic or at-will) against the dragon---the enemy's confidence in
their own heroism/puissance is shaken.

Each metallic dragon has an at-will breath weapon attack that uses the
natural result of the first attack roll to determine how long the dragon
must wait before it can use the breath weapon again.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Natural   Variable Waiting Period for Metallic Dragon's At-Will Breath
  Attack    Attack
  Roll      
  --------- -------------------------------------------------------------
  1-5       The dragon can use its breath weapon again next turn.

  6-10      The dragon must wait one turn before it can use its breath
            weapon.

  11+       After waiting one turn, the dragon rolls a normal save at the
            start of its next turn. If it succeeds, it can use its breath
            weapon that turn. Otherwise, it keeps rolling a save at the
            start of each turn until it regains its breath weapon attack.
            Once it uses its breath again, use the attack roll again to
            determine its next *breath weapon* attack.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

All dragons have distinct personalities. A few have unique features.
They are smart enough not to fight to their own death.

Dragons may have random abilities. This table is for chromatic dragons.
For GMs who are uncertain whether a medium dragon should have a random
ability, roll a d8. Otherwise, roll a d12. If the roll is less than or
equal to the dragon's level, it gets a random ability according to the
table below. Some huge dragons have two abilities. If you want to give
the dragon a chance of having one of the abilities that has campaign
implications, add +2 to the roll.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  d8 or   Dragon Ability  Description (for Chromatic Dragons)
  d12 or                  
  d12 + 2                 
  ------- --------------- ---------------------------------------------------
  1       True seeing     The dragon is immune to invisibility and ignores
                          any illusions.

  2       Whipping tail   When an enemy engaged with the dragon rolls a
                          natural 1 or 2 with an attack roll, the dragon can
                          make an opportunity attack against that creature as
                          a free action. The attack is set up by the dragon's
                          whipping tail but delivered by the dragon's usual
                          melee attack.

  3       Tough Hide      The dragon has a +1 bonus to AC.

  4       Twisted Mind    The dragon has a +2 bonus to MD.

  5       Nimble          The dragon has a +2 bonus to PD.

  6       No              Unlike other dragons of its color, this dragon has
          vulnerability   no vulnerability. The PCs will figure that out the
                          first time they try to use its supposed
                          vulnerability against it.

  7       Now I'm mad!    The first time the dragon is staggered each battle,
                          it uses its breath weapon attack as a free action
                          that does not count against the normal uses of its
                          breath.

  8       Serious threat  Disengage checks against the dragon take a --5
                          penalty. When a creature fails to disengage from
                          the dragon, it takes damage equal to double the
                          dragon's level.

  9       PC-style racial The dragon has one of the racial powers of a player
          power           character race. The most common expressions per
                          color are: white (halfling); black (halfling,
                          half-orc, human, wood elf); green (dwarf, dark
                          elf); blue (high elf, half-orc); red (half-orc,
                          human, wood elf).

  10      Raw power       Until it is staggered, the dragon rolls 2d20 with
                          its melee attacks and uses the higher roll.

  11      Damage aura     When an enemy starts its turn engaged with the
                          dragon, it takes damage equal to the dragon's level
                          (adventurer tier), double the level (champion
                          tier), or triple the level (epic tier). The damage
                          type is the same as the dragon's breath weapon.

  12      More breath     The dragon can use its intermittent breath 1d4 more
                          times each battle. If its breath weapon isn't
                          intermittent (white and green dragons), the dragon
                          gains the extra uses anyway, making it more
                          dangerous than lesser specimens of its color.

  13      Humanoid form   The dragon is capable of shapechanging into a
                          humanoid form, usually of a warrior or spellcaster
                          appropriate to its nature and usually not obviously
                          draconic, registering as a normal humanoid. The
                          dragon has the PC-style racial power of their
                          humanoid form, but only while in shapechanged form.

  14      Some Unique     The dragon has an entirely unique characteristic,
          Thing           something akin to a player character's one unique
                          thing except that the dragon's version may be
                          relevant to combat. GM, if you don't feel like
                          making something up, choose an ability from the
                          list above.
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Metallic dragons also have special abilities, though they differ
slightly from the chromatic dragons' abilities.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  d20   Dragon Ability Description (for Metallic Dragons)
  ----- -------------- ------------------------------------------------------
  1     True seeing    The dragon is immune to invisibility and ignores
                       illusions.

  2     Whipping tail  When an enemy engaged with the dragon rolls a natural
                       1 or 2 with an attack roll, the dragon can make an
                       opportunity attack against that creature as a free
                       action. The attack is set up by the dragon's whipping
                       tail but delivered by the dragon's usual melee attack.

  3     Tough hide     The dragon has a +1 bonus to AC.

  4     Fortress mind  The dragon has a +2 bonus to MD.

  5     Nimble         The dragon has a +2 bonus to PD.

  6     Murderous      The crit range of the dragon's melee attacks expands
                       by 2.

  7     Now I'm mad!   The first time the dragon is staggered each battle, it
                       uses its breath weapon attack as a free action that
                       does not count against the normal uses of its breath.

  8     Serious threat Disengage checks against the dragon take a --5
                       penalty. When a creature fails to disengage from the
                       dragon, it takes damage equal to double the dragon's
                       level.

  9     PC-style       The dragon has one of the racial powers of a player
        racial power   character race. If the dragon's story suggests a
                       specific power, choose that. Otherwise, use the most
                       common expression per color: brass (gnome, halfling);
                       bronze (dark elf, dwarf, half-orc, human); copper
                       (dwarf, human, wood elf); silver (forgeborn, wood
                       elf); gold (high elf, holy one, human, wood elf).

  10    Raw power      Until it's staggered, the dragon rolls 2d20 with its
                       melee attacks and uses the higher roll.

  11    Damage aura    When an enemy starts its turn engaged with the dragon,
                       it takes damage equal to the dragon's level
                       (adventurer tier), double the level (champion tier),
                       or triple the level (epic tier). The damage type is
                       the same as the dragon's breath weapon.

  12    More breath    The dragon gains a +5 bonus to saves to regain its
                       breath weapon.

  13    Spellbreaker   When the dragon hits a creature with an attack, one
                       spell effect that creature created is negated (hard
                       save ends, 16+). Once the creature saves, the effect
                       returns.

  14    Shake off      At the start of each of its turns, the dragon can roll
                       a save against one save ends effect on it.

  15    Free to flee   Like the PCs, the dragon can escape at any time by
                       giving up what amounts for it to a campaign loss. If
                       the PCs are the ones to benefit from this, they should
                       experience this as a major victory. But the dragon is
                       still out there.

  16    Air supremacy  The crit range of the dragon's attacks against flying
                       creatures expands by an amount equal to the escalation
                       die.

  17    Denial         If a PC or other creature uses an attack against the
                       dragon that is related to an icon that the dragon also
                       has a relationship with, the dragon gains a +5 bonus
                       to all defenses against that attack, and it only takes
                       damage from the attack without suffering any of its
                       effects.

  18    Survivor       Each time the dragon drops to 0 hit points, it can
                       roll a save. The first save in a battle is easy (6+),
                       the second normal, the third and subsequent saves are
                       hard (16+). If it succeeds, the dragon stays conscious
                       and takes no damage from the attack or effect that
                       would have dropped it.

  19    Humanoid form  The dragon is capable of shapechanging into a humanoid
                       form, usually of a warrior or spellcaster appropriate
                       to its nature and usually not obviously draconic,
                       registering as a normal human or elf or whatever. This
                       ability is best used for long-term dragon characters
                       that make it worth the GM's time to create a double-
                       or triple-strength humanoid monster to represent the
                       shapechanged form. The dragon has the PC-style racial
                       power of their humanoid form, but only while in
                       shapechanged form. Shapechanging is a move action.

  20    Some unique    The dragon has an entirely unique characteristic,
        thing          something akin to a player character's one unique
                       thing except that the dragon's version may be relevant
                       to combat. GM, if you don't feel like making something
                       up, choose an ability from the list above.

|          | when it becomes staggered, the dragon makes the  | * |   |
|          | attack as a free action and then the breath      | * |   |
|          | recharges.                                       | H |   |

|          | *Made of shadow:* The shadow dragon perceives    | * |   |
|          | the invisible, is unaffected by the *blur*       | * |   |
|          | spell, and ignores illusions. Rogues attempting  |   |   |
|          | to *shadow walk* near a shadow dragon end up in  |   |   |
|          | the dragon's belly (save ends). While there,     |   |   |
|          | they are helpless and take 2d12 damage at the    |   |   |
|          | start of each of their turns until they save and |   |   |
|          | fall back out of shadow.                         |   |   |

|          | *Shadowy escalation:* When in poorly lit areas   |   |   |
|          | of shadow, the dragon adds the escalation die to |   |   |
|          | its attack rolls. Complete darkness or bright    |   |   |
|          | daylight negates the ability.                    |   |   |
|          |                                                  |   |   |

|          | *Shadow illusions:* As a standard action, the    |   |   |
|          | dragon can appear to be humanoid, usually        |   |   |
|          | disguising itself as an unthreatening old man in |   |   |
|          | a cloak (DC 35 to detect). Daylight will show    |   |   |
|          | the illusion for what it is---an insubstantial   |   |   |
|          | dragon. Dragons with a *Book of Many Faces* will |   |   |
|          | have perfect humanoid disguises. Dropping the    |   |   |
|          | illusion is a free action.                       |   |   |
|          |                                                  |   |   |
|          | *Shadowy phasing:* When the escalation die is    |   |   |
|          | even, natural odd attack rolls against the       |   |   |
|          | dragon automatically miss. When the escalation   |   |   |
|          | die is odd, natural even attack rolls against    |   |   |
|          | the dragon automatically miss. Attacks that deal |   |   |
|          | holy damage ignore this ability.                 |   |   |
|          |                                                  |   |   |

|          | While on "holy ground" such as a temple or       |   |   |
|          | consecrated shrine, all hard saves against       |   |   |
|          | shadow dragon effects become normal saves. As a  |   |   |
|          | standard action, a cleric who invokes the gods   |   |   |
|          | can produce a similar anti-shadow effect in the  |   |   |
|          | nearby area until the start of their next turn,  |   |   |
|          | or they can turn hard saves against shadow       |   |   |
|          | dragon abilities to easy saves if that area is   |   |   |
|          | already on holy ground. Shadow dragons try to    |   |   |
|          | avoid holy ground, and shadow thieves can only   |   |   |
|          | enter it while possessing victims and will flee  |   |   |
|          | once the possession ends. It's up to the GM what |   |   |
|          | counts as "holy ground" in their game.           |   |   |

|          | vs. MD (one enemy hit by *shadow                 | * |   |

|          | inside" the target. The target is confused (save |   |   |
|          | ends), and the shadow thief can't be the target  | * |   |
|          | of an attack or effect until it's forced from    | * |   |
|          | the target's body when that creature saves       | M |   |
|          | against the confusion effect.                    | D |   |

|          | *Group ability:* For every four shadow thieves   | * |   |
|          | in the battle (round up), one of them can use    |   |   |
|          | *shadow possession* during the battle.           | * |   |
|          |                                                  | * |   |
|          | *Shadow thievery:* The shadow thief is an        | H |   |
|          | extension of the shadow dragon, not really a     | P |   |
|          | separate entity. When it drops to 0 hp, it flees | * |   |
|          | back to the shadow dragon and merges with it.    | * |   |
|          | When this happens, if there is at least one      |   |   |
|          | enemy engaged with that shadow thief, the thief  |   |   |
|          | chooses one enemy engaged with it. Roll a d20;   |   |   |
|          | on a 16+, the shadow thief steals a random magic |   |   |
|          | item from the chosen enemy as it flees back to   |   |   |
|          | the dragon (but see *stop...thief* below).       |   |   |
|          | Stolen items are replaced with shadowy           |   |   |
|          | duplicates that work until the end of the battle |   |   |
|          | then fade to nothingness. The items can be       |   |   |
|          | recovered if the dragon is slain in the same     |   |   |
|          | battle.                                          |   |   |

|          | *Stop...thief!* When a shadow thief steals an    |   |   |
|          | item, the creature it steals from can choose to  |   |   |
|          | prevent the theft, but at a cost. If the natural |   |   |
|          | d20 thievery roll was odd, the target of the     |   |   |
|          | thievery attempt can choose to keep the item but |   |   |
|          | become hampered (save ends) as they wrestle with |   |   |
|          | the shadow. If the natural thievery roll was     |   |   |
|          | even, the target has the same choice, but it's a |   |   |
|          | hard save (16+) to end the hampered effect.      |   |   |

|          | *Temporal manastorm:* The empyrean dragon's      |   |   |
|          | connection to the overworld falters, creating a  |   |   |
|          | storm of distorted time and magic in the area.   |   |   |
|          | The dragon's critical hit range for all attacks  |   |   |
|          | expands by 2 until the end of the battle. In     |   |   |
|          | addition, when a target saves against the        |   |   |
|          | ongoing damage from this attack, the crit range  |   |   |
|          | of its attacks against the dragon expands by 1   |   |   |

|          | *Three heads are better than one:* The empyrean  |   |   |
|          | dragon can make two *gleaming bite* attacks as a |   |   |
|          | single standard action, one each from two heads. |   |   |
|          | The third head is assumed to be maneuvering the  |   |   |
|          | body around. It can choose not to make one of    |   |   |
|          | those attacks to end any condition affecting it  |   |   |
|          | except for ongoing damage (this includes the     |   |   |
|          | stunned condition, even though it technically    |   |   |
|          | doesn't get an action when stunned).             |   |   |
|          |                                                  |   |   |
|          | An enemy who scores a critical hit against an    |   |   |
|          | empyrean dragon can forego the extra damage to   |   |   |
|          | lop off one of the dragon's heads. If an enemy   |   |   |
|          | deals 150 damage with a single attack against    |   |   |
|          | the dragon, the attack will also remove a head.  |   |   |
|          | An empyrean dragon with two remaining heads can  |   |   |
|          | make only one *gleaming bite* attack as a        |   |   |
|          | standard action and can't sacrifice that attack  |   |   |
|          | to remove conditions. The dragon dies if all     |   |   |
|          | three heads are removed.                         |   |   |

|          | *Intermittent breath:* An empyrean dragon can    |   |   |

|          | never two turns in a row.                        |   |   |

|          | *Intermittent breath:* A hoardsong dragon can |      |   |
|          | use *precise breath* 1d4 times per battle,    |      |   |

|          | *Known to an ounce:* The dragon knows where   |      |   |
|          | every treasure in its hoard is located,       |      |   |
|          | allowing it to detect any movement or         |      |   |
|          | shifting of the coins and valuables. While in |      |   |
|          | its lair with its hoard, the hoardsong dragon |      |   |
|          | is immune to invisibility and ignores         |      |   |
|          | illusions, and creatures attempting to hide   |      |   |
|          | from it take a --5 penalty to their checks.   |      |   |

|          | *Resist fire 16+:* When a fire attack targets |      |   |
|          | this creature, the attacker must roll a       |      |   |
|          | natural 16+ on the attack roll or it only     |      |   |
|          | deals half damage.                            |      |   |

|          | *Hoard minions:* The dragon's connection to   |      |   |
|          | its hoard is so strong that it has some       |      |   |
|          | control over the souls of those it previously |      |   |
|          | killed who owned the treasures. Once per      |      |   |
|          | round as a quick action, the hoardsong dragon |      |   |
|          | can summon 1d4 hoard spirits that take form   |      |   |
|          | by surrounding themselves in coins, wear      |      |   |
|          | empty suits of armor, etc., and defend the    |      |   |
|          | dragon's hoard. Roll initiative for the       |      |   |
|          | minions once and use that count for all       |      |   |
|          | additional minions.                           |      |   |

|          | *The call of the hoard:* The connection of a  |      |   |
|          | hoardsong dragon to its hoard imparts the     |      |   |
|          | dragon's magic upon the hoard. Before battle, |      |   |
|          | if the PCs are able to see the hoard while    |      |   |
|          | the dragon speaks to them, each PC that can   |      |   |
|          | hear the dragon must roll a Wisdom check. On  |      |   |
|          | a result of 24 or less, that PC is charmed as |      |   |
|          | per the *charm person* spell and considers    |      |   |
|          | the dragon a friend. On a result of 25--29,   |      |   |
|          | the PC is lulled by the dragon's words and    |      |   |
|          | the sight of the hoard; if combat occurs, the |      |   |
|          | PC will be stunned during their first round.  |      |   |
|          | The dragon will make a suggestion to charmed  |      |   |
|          | PCs to leave and bring it more treasure for   |      |   |
|          | its hoard (while it prepares surprises for    |      |   |
|          | their return). Charmed PCs won't attack the   |      |   |
|          | dragon, but can make a normal save each round |      |   |
|          | in battle to break the charm effect (or every |      |   |
|          | day outside of combat).                       |      |   |

### Dragon, The Purple

[Standard Abilities]{.underline}

Rather than repeat these for each entry the following abilities are
standard for the Purple Dragon.

*Escalator:* The Purple Dragon adds the escalation die to their attacks.

*Shape-shifter supreme:* The Purple Dragon can choose to be in its human
form or its dragon form. Switching forms is a move action. Though their
dragon form is huge, their human form is regular size, and other forms
are whatever size is appropriate to that form. By epic tier the Purple
Dragon can conceivably take any form, but regardless of tier their
vanity limits her to forms that feature purple and magenta (purple
clothes and magenta hair, purple scales and magenta wing membranes,
etc.).

*\[Adventurer and champion tier non-ally only\] Cunning escapes:* When
the Purple Dragon drops to 0 hp or fewer (or would otherwise die) they
are not slain, but instead escapes leaving an illusion in their place.
When they escape it is a campaign win for the party, as though they had
been killed, and their plans crumble. The Purple Dragon cannot return
until the next tier (if defeated at adventurer tier they cannot return
until champion tier, if defeated at champion tier they return at epic
tier).

*\[Once per battle, in human form only\] "No, they're the real Purple
Dragon, shoot them!":* As a quick action at the end of one of their
turns, the Purple Dragon uses their powers of illusion and mind-control
to make one of their attackers (usually the closest one to them) look
and sound like them; the next attack against the Purple Dragon has a 50%
chance of being targeted against the wrong target. Once the next attack
is made, the illusion vanishes.

*Flight:* In their dragon form the Purple Dragon can fly. The Purple
Dragon can also fly using magic, but prefers to not do so unless they
need to fight a flying enemy.

*Illusionary soiree:* Each round roll a d6 (or a d4 if the fight is at a
party or a luxurious lair), if it is equal to or less than the
escalation die it has the following effect.

**1: Sparkling lights**---Ranged attacks against the Purple Dragon or
their allies have a -2 penalty.

**2-3: Kaleidoscopic kinescope**---Any attacks against the Purple Dragon
this round that are natural 1s are rerolled against the nearest ally of
the attacker (or against the attacker themselves if there is no other
possible target).

**4+: Illusionary terrain**---Any of the Purple Dragon's enemies that
move this round must roll a save, on a failure they end up in a place
they did not intend.

[Nastier Specials]{.underline}

*"You've got the wrong person":* The Purple Dragon's *"No, they're the
real Purple Dragon, shoot them!"* ability lingers long after the battle,
maybe for days. This is probably deliberate magic on their part, because
when they skip town the party member that looks and sounds like them
will take the fall (or at least create enough confusion for them to make
good their escape).

*\[Epic tier only\] Not dead yet:* The Purple Dragon gets one last
*cunning escape* at epic tier, and though their plans are ruined by
their defeat they'll return one last time to exact their vengeance upon
the party.

|          | *Crit against a target already taking ongoing    | * |   |
|          | psychic damage:* The target must start making    |   |   |
|          | last gasp saves, if they fail they believe that  |   |   |
|          | they are the Purple Dragon. Removing this        |   |   |
|          | delusion from the target's mind is as difficult  |   |   |
|          | as turning a petrified character back from stone |   |   |

|          | uses their powers of illusion and mind-control   |   |   |
|          | to make one of their attackers look and sound    |   |   |
|          | like them; the next attack has a 50% chance of   |   |   |
|          | being targeted against the wrong target.         |   |   |

|          | *Intermittent breath:* The Purple Dragon can use |   |   |
|          | their psychoactive breath 2d4 times each combat  |   |   |
|          | but never two turns in a row. They can also      |   |   |
|          | choose to make their targets confused (save      |   |   |
|          | ends) on a hit or miss with their *psychoactive  |   |   |
|          | breath*, but that uses up their breath for the   |   |   |
|          | rest of the battle.                              |   |   |
|          |                                                  |   |   |
|          | *Wing buffet:* That *bladed fan* attack? Yeah,   |   |   |
|          | that was the Purple Dragon's wings hidden by an  |   |   |
|          | illusion. The Purple Dragon can use the *bladed  |   |   |
|          | fan* attack in this form, but now it is clear    |   |   |
|          | that they are using their wings so it is only +9 |   |   |
|          | to attack.                                       |   |   |

|          | *\[Once per battle\] Cloak of illusion:* As a    |   |   |
|          | quick action the Purple Dragon fills the         |   |   |
|          | battlefield with illusions that give enemies     |   |   |
|          | attacking them a -2 penalty to their attacks.    |   |   |
|          | This lasts until they next attack.               |   |   |

|          | ends) on a hit or miss with their *psychoactive  |   |   |
|          | breath*, but that uses up their breath for the   |   |   |

### Drow

Drow may optionally include one of these abilities as nastier specials:
*Drow Cruelty* or *Poisons and Potions*.

[Drow Cruelty]{.underline}

Choose one of the following abilities for all non-mook drow in a battle
to have:

*Poisoner:* When the drow scores a critical hit, it can forego damage to
force the target to start making last gasp saves. On the fourth failure,
the target falls unconscious (and can't be woken normally) for 2d4
minutes.

*Take advantage of weakness:* Whenever an enemy nearby a drow rolls a
save, it takes its level in damage.

*Umbral caul:* As long as at least one drow uses a standard action each
round to maintain the supernatural darkness, each non-drow creature in
the battle becomes dazed (save ends) whenever it rolls a natural 1--5
with an attack roll.

*Venomous:* The first time each battle a drow hits with a weapon attack,
the target also takes 5 ongoing poison damage.

[Poisons and Potions]{.underline}

Drinking a potion, applying a poison, or using a substance requires only
a quick action for a drow with one of these options. Characters who
acquire any of these drow items must use a standard action to
drink/apply them.

*Draft of Eschaton* (potion): When drunk it immediately purges the body
of all poisons and toxins and ends any ongoing conditions. All the
drinker's saves (including last gasp saves and death saves)
automatically succeed for the rest of the battle or for five minutes.
Immediately after the battle, the drinker must make a DC 30 Constitution
check or be completely debilitated and unable to travel far or to fight
for a day.

*Dragon Apples:* Small ceramic spheres that explode. Make a basic ranged
attack against a nearby enemy (or level + 5 for drow); on a hit, the
target takes 10 ongoing fire damage.

*Midnight Tincture:* When this glass vial is broken, the nearby area is
shrouded in clinging darkness. The darkness lasts 3 rounds. Each
creature in the darkness except drow takes a --4 attack penalty. The
tincture can be attached to an arrow or bolt.

*Potion of Spider Climbing:* For one battle or five minutes the drinker
can climb on ceilings and walls as easily as it moves on the ground.

*Spider Venom:* A creature hit by a melee weapon coated in the venom
takes 5 ongoing poison damage when the attack roll is a natural 16+.

*Web Dust:* Made from desiccated spiders, this dust can hold a door shut
or stick an object to a wall for five minutes. Champion-tier creatures
can make a DC 20 skill check to rip through something held by *web dust*
before it fully dissolves, and epic-tier creatures can rip through such
objects in a round. Further applications increase the effectiveness:
three applications lasts for fifteen minutes, requires 3 successful
checks, and takes 3 rounds for epic-tier characters to get through.

|           | that attacker takes 8 ongoing poison damage from  | H |   |

### Eidolon

As a free action each round, an eidolon can use one of the three
following abilities, which to them are as natural as breathing is to
mortals. (GMs, due to these special abilities, eidolons are especially
deadly when they have allies.) When including eidolons in battles, you
don't need to (and probably shouldn't!) use these abilities all the
time; they're better as a nasty surprise.

*Split reality:* The eidolon splits the party into different realities.
Each player rolls a d4 for their character. That PC can only perceive
and interact with the eidolon and with other characters who rolled the
same number. That means PCs in different realities can't communicate or
affect each other in any way. For the rest of the battle, each player
rolls a d4 at the start of the round to see which reality their
character is now in. At the start of each round, the eidolon can choose
which version(s) of reality its allies are in.

*Warp time:* At the start of each round two combatants swap places in
the initiative order as determined by the eidolon. Alternately, the
eidolon warps the momentum of the battle and the escalation die value is
determined at the start of the round with a d6 roll.

*Reshuffle space:* The eidolon swaps the position of two creatures in
the battle at the start of the round. Alternately, if you are using
minis and some sort of map tiles you can rearrange the tiles with the
minis still on them.

Finally, all eidolons have the following ability, which plays well with
the "recurring enemy" story.

*Undying:* When an eidolon drops to 0 hp it becomes discorporate. The
eidolon isn't dead, just gone. It has lost its link to or focus upon the
time and place where the adventurers are. If adventurers drive off an
eidolon repeatedly it will probably just stay away. Eidolons can be
vindictive and hold grudges, but they have many possible worlds to
interact with and if a mortal proves too troublesome the eidolon will
move on. In general eidolons need defeating on three separate occasions
to convince them to stay away forever.

strengths related to that icon, eidolons usually call icon-related
oddities 'iconic tests'. How much of these icon-related 'tests' are due
to the eidolons being mythically linked to an icon and how much is a
role that the eidolon is playing is left to you as the GM to decide.

Eidolons usually go out of their way to reveal any weaknesses they have
as part of their 'test' of mortals.

**Magic Icon**---Wizard spells do double damage against the eidolon
(crits do triple). Wizard spells used creatively against the eidolon
have additional effects depending on the whim of the GM.

**Zealous Icon**---The eidolons' attacks do double damage against those
who have positive relationships with the Demonic Icon and sorcerers with
the infernal heritage talent.

**Demonic Icon**---If you are willing to owe a mystically-enforced favor
to the Demonic Icon, you can make this eidolon weakened (--4 attack and
defenses) until the end of your turn.

**Underground Icon**---The eidolon does double damage against those
using magical items, unless they have recently tithed to the Underground
Icon.

**Graceful Icon**---The eidolon takes double damage from attacks made by
bards, and attacks made using bows (but not from crossbows, which do
their normal damage).

**Leader Icon**---Adventurers who fight side-by-side with each other (or
back-to-back) gain +2 to all their defenses while doing so.

**Protector Icon**---Attacks by dragonics, breath weapons, and attacks
from sorcerers with the metallic protector heritage talent deal double
damage to this eidolon.

**Nature Icon**---The eidolon takes double damage from animal
companions, and from druids in beast form. Plants near this eidolon grow
more verdantly, flowers blooming in its presence.

**Undead Icon**---Spend a recovery to weaken (--4 attack and defense)
the eidolon until the end of your turn. Well, we say 'spend' but what
you are actually doing is sacrificing a sliver of your life-energy to
the Undead Icon.

**Brute Icon**---If the attacker subtracts a die from their damage dice
before rolling them, it takes double damage. The extra die of damage
must be used to harm something or somebody relating to cities or
civilization (instead of rolling 3d8 damage you'd roll 2d8x2 damage, and
deal 1d8 damage to a window, book, mayor, etc.). The GM and player
should work together to determine what a 'die of damage' means to
whatever is getting smashed or slashed as part of the attack.

**Religious Icon**---If since the start of the Eidolon's last turn, any
adventurer has received healing from somebody who has a positive or
conflicted relationship with the Religious Icon, then the Eidolon is
dazed (--4 attack) until the end of its next turn.

**Trickster Icon**---Sneak attack damage dice for attacks against this
eidolon are two die types higher (1d4 becomes 1d8, 2d6 becomes 2d10,
etc.). Rogues can shadow walk without needing to make a roll first.

**Draconic Icon**---This eidolon takes double damage from poison,
lightning, or fire attacks, as well as from attacks from sorcerers with
the chromatic destroyer heritage talent deal double damage to this
eidolon.

### Elemental Beast

[Making Elemental Beasts]{.underline}

Any creature with the \[BEAST\] type can become an elemental beast, just
follow these guidelines.

The base creature loses whatever resistances and vulnerabilities it had
and gains those listed for its elemental affinity. It also gains between
one and three elemental abilities for that affinity from the options
below.

With just one ability, as well as a new vulnerability and resistance,
creatures that become elemental beasts aren't powerful or changed enough
to warrant adjusting their level for purposes of creating encounters.
However, you may want to up-level beasts with two or three abilities
depending on those abilities and your desired level of difficulty,
especially if you're creating a battle with several elemental beasts.

For balance, simplicity, pacing, and playability, don't use more than
three abilities for an elemental beast.

[Powers of Air]{.underline}

All elemental beasts with an affinity for air gain the following three
abilities:

-   *Flight:* This creature can fly.

-   *Resist thunder 16+*

-   *Resist lightning 16+*

All air elemental beasts have *vulnerability: force*.

In addition, choose at least one and no more than three additional
abilities from the following list.

-   *Swirling winds:* When a ranged attack targets this creature, the
    attacker must roll 2d20 and take the lowest result.

-   *D*ust devil: Make the following attack as a standard action.

    -   **C: Swirling dust devil +5 + level vs. PD (1d3 nearby enemies
        in a group)**---The target is dazed (save ends)

-   *Gust front:* When this creature rolls a natural even hit with an
    attack, it can pop free from the target of that attack.

-   *Static field:* Each enemy engaged with this creature at the start
    of its turn takes lightning damage equal to this creature's level ×
    3.

-   *Lightning rod:* Any attack against this creature's nearby ally that
    deals lightning damage instead targets this creature.

[Powers of Earth]{.underline}

All elemental beasts with an affinity for earth gain the following three
abilities.

-   *Roots of earth:* When an effect would move this creature, roll a

|          | 'cost' of two points on the escalation die. For  |   |   |
|          | example, if the escalation die is 6, the attack  |   |   |
|          | could target two engaged enemies and two nearby  |   |   |

|          | *Wild Ability:* Each barrier beasts has one of   |   |   |
|          | the following wild abilities.                    |   |   |
|          |                                                  |   |   |
|          | *Amphibious:* The barrier beast can swim         |   |   |
|          | underwater swiftly and indefinitely.             |   |   |
|          |                                                  |   |   |
|          | *Burrowing:* As amphibious, but instead of       |   |   |
|          | travelling underwater the barrier beast can      |   |   |
|          | "swim" through the earth.                        |   |   |

|          | *Flight:* The barrier beast can fly very         |   |   |
|          | quickly, if not very gracefully.                 |   |   |

|          | *Mountain Shell:* Twice per battle as a standard |   |   |
|          | action, the barrier beast can gain a +4 to all   |   |   |
|          | defenses until it makes an attack.               |   |   |

|          | *Regrowth:* Twice per battle as a standard       |   |   |
|          | action, the barrier beast can regain 100 hit     |   |   |
|          | points.                                          |   |   |

|          | *Beast surge:* Once per round when a barrier     |   |   |
|          | beast takes more than 100 damage from an attack, |   |   |
|          | all enemy-caused conditions affecting the        |   |   |
|          | barrier beast end. Then the barrier beast rolls  |   |   |
|          | a normal save; if the save succeeds, the barrier |   |   |
|          | beast gets an additional free action that        |   |   |
|          | depends on its *wild ability* (see below):       |   |   |
|          |                                                  |   |   |
|          | If the barrier beast has *amphibious, burrowing, |   |   |
|          | or flight*, it can choose to swim/burrow/ or fly |   |   |
|          | someplace faraway without taking opportunity     |   |   |
|          | attacks as a free action. At the start of its    |   |   |
|          | next turn, the barrier beast gains a free move   |   |   |
|          | action.                                          |   |   |
|          |                                                  |   |   |
|          | If the barrier beasts has *mountain shell*, it   |   |   |
|          | uses it as a free action that does not count     |   |   |
|          | against its uses of the ability.                 |   |   |
|          |                                                  |   |   |
|          | If the barrier beast has *regrowth*, it can use  |   |   |
|          | that ability as a free action as a free action   |   |   |
|          | that does not count against its uses of the      |   |   |
|          | ability.                                         |   |   |
|          |                                                  |   |   |
|          | *Beast resilience:* At-will and basic attacks do |   |   |
|          | not deal miss damage to a barrier beast, and     |   |   |
|          | when an attack against AC or PD targets this     |   |   |
|          | creature it deals half damage unless the natural |   |   |
|          | attack roll is 16+.                              |   |   |
|          |                                                  |   |   |
|          | This ability does not work against attacks it is |   |   |
|          | vulnerable to, and ends when the escalation die  |   |   |
|          | is 6+.                                           |   |   |

|          | *Shrug:* The barrier beast ignores damage that's |   |   |
|          | less than 10.                                    |   |   |
|          |                                                  |   |   |
|          | *If it bleeds:* Each barrier beast is vulnerable |   |   |
|          | to one damage type (chosen by the GM or          |   |   |
|          | determined randomly). When a barrier beast is    |   |   |
|          | hit by an attack it is vulnerable to, it cannot  |   |   |
|          | use *beast surge* until the end of its next      |   |   |
|          | turn.                                            |   |   |

|          | *Big enough:* A barrier beast is immune to       |   |   |
|          | opportunity attacks from any creature that is    |   |   |
|          | not huge size or larger (like a barrier beast).  |   |   |
|          | Normal sized enemies can disengage from a        |   |   |
|          | barrier beast by rolling 6+ instead of the       |   |   |
|          | normal 11+.                                      |   |   |

|          | *Wilder beast:* The barrier beast has two (or    |   |   |
|          | even three!) *wild abilities* instead of one.    |   |   |
|          | Choose which additional effect is used each time |   |   |
|          | beast surge is triggered.                        |   |   |

|          | *Breath weapon:* When the escalation die is even |   |   |
|          | the barrier beast can make a *breath weapon*     |   |   |
|          | attack as a quick action once per round, or use  |   |   |
|          | it as the additional effect when *beast surge*   |   |   |
|          | is triggered. Pick or roll a random energy type  |   |   |
|          | that is different from the vulnerability of the  |   |   |
|          | barrier beast. *Breath weapon* does that type of |   |   |

|          | creature of less than huge size that is engaged  |   |    |
|          | with or next to it before or after the movement  |   |    |
|          | takes 60 damage. In addition, the Fallen Icon is |   |    |
|          | immune to opportunity attacks. Enemies of less   |   |    |
|          | than huge size can disengage from it with an     |   |    |

|          | Fallen Icon can change its creature type to      |   |    |
|          | beast, elemental, or plant. This ends all        |   |    |
|          | conditions affecting it.                         |   |    |

|          | *Natural resistance:* The Fallen Icon has        |   |    |

|          | has *resist cold 16+*. As a plant it has *resist |   |    |

|          | *Earth and sea and sky:* The Fallen Icon can     |   |    |
|          | sprout wings to clumsily fly, and can swim       |   |    |
|          | indefinitely at any depth.                       |   |    |

|          | *Natural supremacy:* The Fallen Icon's existence |   |    |
|          | disrupts arcane magic and divine magic (but not  |   |    |
|          | druidic magic): natural odd hits by arcane and   |   |    |
|          | divine spells miss the Fallen Icon, while odd    |   |    |
|          | misses are rerolled against an enemy engaged     |   |    |
|          | with the Fallen Icon. Natural 1s target the      |   |    |
|          | caster.                                          |   |    |

|          | *Enemy of civilization:* As a move action, the   |   |    |
|          | Fallen Icon can destroy one ordinary structure   |   |    |
|          | it can reach, such as a house, castle wall,      |   |    |
|          | temple, or ship. The structure is automatically  |   |    |
|          | rendered useless, and each creature inside or on |   |    |
|          | the structure is subject to a *collapse* attack  |   |    |
|          |                                                  |   |    |
|          | **Collapse +16 vs. PD (each creature in/on       |   |    |
|          | structure)**---90 damage and the target is stuck |   |    |
|          | and takes 20 ongoing damage (hard save ends      |   |    |
|          | both, 16+)                                       |   |    |
|          |                                                  |   |    |
|          | *Those that walk the forest:* Whenever the       |   |    |
|          | Fallen Icon becomes staggered, suffers more than |   |    |
|          | 120 damage from a single attack, or is           |   |    |
|          | critically hit, a mob of Fallen Icon mooks will  |   |    |
|          | join the battle nearby the triggering enemy.     |   |    |
|          | While these creatures are in play, the Fallen    |   |    |
|          | Icon has a bonus to all defenses equal to the    |   |    |
|          | number of Fallen Icon mobs in the battle.        |   |    |
|          |                                                  |   |    |
|          | *Seeds on the wind:* If the Fallen Icon is       |   |    |
|          | slain, the GM secretly rolls a normal save (11+) |   |    |
|          | at the end of *each session*, including this     |   |    |
|          | one. If the save succeeds, the Fallen Icon       |   |    |
|          | returns to life near where it fell or in some    |   |    |
|          | distant wilderness. If the campaign somehow ends |   |    |
|          | while the Fallen Icon is still dead, it's the    |   |    |
|          | GM's call whether the Fallen Icon stays dead or  |   |    |
|          | rises after the events of the campaign.          |   |    |
|          |                                                  |   |    |

|          | *Omnivorous:* When a creature engaged with or    |   |    |
|          | next to the Fallen Icon dies (including the last |   |    |
|          | mook of a mob), the Fallen Icon consumes it and  |   |    |
|          | regains 100 HP.                                  |   |    |

First PC campaign victory: Remove the Fallen Icon's *natural supremacy*
ability.

Second PC campaign victory: *Angry sky* only triggers when the
escalation die is even.

Third PC campaign victory: Remove the *seeds on the wind* ability.

Fourth PC campaign victory: Remove the 60 damage dealt by the
*ambulatory landscape* ability.

[Mook Squads]{.underline}

When *those that walk the forest* is triggered, roll 1d4+2 for the
number of mooks in the mob. Then roll a d6 to determine which mooks join
the battle; 1--2: fanatical druid circle; 3: frenzied wolf pack; 4:
militant ranger squad; 5: opportunistic orc band; 6: treant avenger.

Remember that starting a battle with these mooks in play makes the
Fallen Icon tougher thanks to the defense bonus that's part of *those
that walk the forest*.

|          | Fallen Icon may make a *golden greed* attack     | * |    |
|          | against 1d4 other nearby enemies as a free       |   |    |
|          | action. (It's possible the PCs should have some  |   |    |
|          | warning, for example, a magic item might be      |   |    |
|          | too-eagerly wheedling to be used. Or maybe you'd |   |    |
|          | rather teach lessons the hard way.)              |   |    |
|          |                                                  |   |    |
|          | *The mask slips:* When first staggered, the      |   |    |
|          | Fallen Icon makes a *behind the mask* attack     |   |    |
|          | against the enemy that caused the triggering     |   |    |
|          | damage as a free action.                         |   |    |

|          | *The wandering king:* The Fallen Icon can deal   |   |    |
|          | 4d6 damage to itself and teleport someplace it   |   |    |
|          | can see nearby as a move action.                 |   |    |
|          |                                                  |   |    |
|          | *Sticks and rags:* The Fallen Icon has *resist   |   |    |
|          | damage 16+* to attacks not made with epic-tier   |   |    |
|          | magical weapons, implements, or bracers. Enemies |   |    |
|          | not wearing epic-tier magical armor are          |   |    |
|          | vulnerable to its *hammer of golden sovereignty* |   |    |
|          | attacks (that's right---eschewing magic items    |   |    |
|          | makes it easier to defeat the minions of the     |   |    |
|          | Fallen Icon, but harder to beat the Fallen Icon  |   |    |
|          | itself).                                         |   |    |
|          |                                                  |   |    |
|          | *Even worse:* When the escalation die is even,   |   |    |
|          | the Fallen Icon rolls 2d20 instead of 1d20 and   |   |    |
|          | uses the higher result whenever it attacks or    |   |    |
|          | rolls a save.                                    |   |    |
|          |                                                  |   |    |
|          | Fallen icon: The Fallen Icon is no longer an     |   |    |
|          | icon, but it still possesses magical bonds with  |   |    |
|          | reality that make it difficult to destroy. See   |   |    |
|          | the Campaign Impact section immediately          |   |    |
|          | following the Fallen Icon's stat block for ways  |   |    |
|          | in which significant campaign victories can make |   |    |
|          | the Fallen Icon easier to defeat. (To be clear:  |   |    |
|          | if the PCs don't achieve any of these campaign   |   |    |
|          | victories, the Fallen Icon will be difficult or  |   |    |
|          | perhaps even impossible to destroy.)             |   |    |
|          |                                                  |   |    |
|          | *Compel fealty:* An epic-tier dwarf, forgeborn,  |   |    |
|          | or human slain by the Fallen Icon will arise at  |   |    |
|          | the end of the battle as a bronze kingsguard,    |   |    |
|          | loyal gatherer, or royal bearer---whichever      |   |    |
|          | seems most appropriate.                          |   |    |
|          |                                                  |   |    |
|          | *Eternal kingdom:* If the Fallen Icon King is    |   |    |
|          | slain, the GM secretly rolls a normal save (11+) |   |    |
|          | at the end of *each session*, including this     |   |    |
|          | one. If the save succeeds, the Fallen Icon       |   |    |
|          | returns to life in one of its secret treasure    |   |    |
|          | rooms deep in the underworld. If the campaign    |   |    |
|          | somehow ends while the Fallen Icon is still      |   |    |
|          | dead, it's the GM's call whether the Fallen Icon |   |    |
|          | stays dead or rises after the events of the      |   |    |
|          | campaign.                                        |   |    |

|          | *Fealty owed:* Human, dwarf, and forgeborn       |   |    |
|          | characters may not use their racial power until  |   |    |
|          | the escalation die reaches 4 or higher, and not  |   |    |
|          | when engaged with the Fallen Icon (so standard   |   |    |
|          | humans are simply out of luck).                  |   |    |
|          |                                                  |   |    |
|          | *Fealty shown:* The first time each round an     |   |    |
|          | attack would reduce the Fallen Icon to zero hit  |   |    |
|          | points or less, it instead damages the closest   |   |    |
|          | nearby loyal gatherer. If these have all been    |   |    |
|          | destroyed, the attack damages the closest nearby |   |    |
|          | royal bearer, then finally the closest bronze    |   |    |
|          | kingsguard. If these have all been destroyed,    |   |    |
|          | the Fallen Icon is reduced to zero hit           |   |    |
|          | points---but see *long live the icon* below.     |   |    |
|          |                                                  |   |    |
|          | *Long Live the Icon:* When the Fallen Icon is    |   |    |
|          | finally defeated, nothing remains but a          |   |    |
|          | featureless gold mask that wants to be picked    |   |    |
|          | up. This mask makes a *golden greed* attack      |   |    |
|          | against each enemy in the battle as a free       |   |    |
|          | action. The save to end the confusion from this  |   |    |
|          | attack is a hard save, with confused targets     |   |    |
|          | violently fighting over the mask. When no        |   |    |
|          | targets are confused, the mask crumbles into     |   |    |
|          | dust. (If one PC slays the others while          |   |    |
|          | confused, they're probably going to put on the   |   |    |
|          | mask.)                                           |   |    |

Fourth PC campaign victory: Remove *the wandering king*.

### Faun

[Ability for all fauns: destiny]{.underline}

Fauns who are likely to end up in a fight choose one of two paths. The
paths determine which of their defenses will be higher, and in some
cases determine an additional ability or two.

*Path of the Sword:* More martial-minded, these fauns are usually
warriors, thieves, and hunters. They have a higher Physical Defense
(PD).

*Path of Song:* Magically-inclined, these fauns are usually bards,
magicians, priests, or druids. They have a higher Mental Defense (MD).

### Flower of Unlife

All flowers of unlife have a nastier special available called *Iconic
energy drain*. When a PC is associated with an icon that is also
associated with the flower of unlife (e.g. undead or nature icons), and
they roll a natural 1--5 with an attack against the flower, the attacker
takes 2d6 damage and the flower heals that many hit points.

|           | Wisdom check, adding +1 for each of their allies  |   |   |

|           | the spriggan grows in size as a free action,      |   |   |
|           | acquiring its *giant-sized slap* attack. Note     |   |   |
|           | that as a free action, this transformation can    |   |   |
|           | take place any time, usually at the start of a    |   |   |
|           | round. If the spriggan was using its *hidden      |   |   |

### The Fomori

[Unclean-One Abilities]{.underline}

Add one or two of the following abilities to humanoids to create
cultists who worship the true-fomori (or to beasts to create corrupted
animals).

1.  *Ugly physique:* The cultist is repulsive almost beyond
    comprehension, but its twisted form grants it the ability to
    withstand blows. It gains +2 to AC and +1 to PD.

2.  *Uncanny speed:* The unclean-one gains a +1d10 bonus to its
    initiative. It has a +2 attack bonus against enemies that started
    the battle with lower initiative scores.

3.  *Unearthly beauty:* The cultist has a perfect and unaging physical
    body, a counterpoint to its increasingly corrupted soul. It gains +2
    to PD and MD.

4.  *Unhealthy vigor:* When a melee attack hits the unclean-one, sores
    and pustules on its body burst, and the attacker takes 5 acid damage
    (champion: 10 damage; epic 15 damage).

5.  *Unhinged joints:* The unclean-one cultist can move in strange ways,
    crawling up walls like a giant bug, skittering along the ground, and
    so forth. It gains a +2 bonus to disengage checks.

6.  *Unholy regeneration:* When the escalation die is odd, the
    unclean-one heals hit points equal to its level times the escalation
    die value at the start of its turn.

7.  *Unnatural strength:* Once per battle, when the unclean-one misses
    with an attack (but not when it fumbles), it can change it to a hit
    and increase the damage by 2 for every point in the difference
    between the missed result and what it needed to hit as a free
    action. When it does, it takes 1d6 damage for every 2 extra damage
    it deals this way. (It must deal the extra damage if it changes a
    miss into a hit.)

8.  *Unreal scent:* Humanoid enemies that move into engagement with the
    unclean-one must immediately roll a save or take 5 poison damage
    (champion: 10 damage, epic 15: damage). Non-humanoid enemies
    (including druids in beast form, those who have taken undead form
    with the aid of necromantic spells, construct races, ooze races,
    etc.) might be more susceptible (hard save, 16+), or less
    susceptible (easy save, 6+), GM's call.

All unclean-ones get the following ability

*Unreasonable master:* The true-fomori can reach into the unclean-one's
mind to give them visions and look through their memories. In this way
the fomori keeps an eye on its far-flung cults, and gives guidance to
its heralds, even speaking directly through them if it desires. Oh, and
those visions can be instructive religious apparitions, pleasing dreams
sent as rewards, or terrifying and painful hallucinations sent as
punishment (or because the fomori felt like inflicting suffering).

[Fomorian Mutation Nastier Specials]{.underline}

Roll on the table below if you wish. You can also give fomorians some
unclean-one abilities (though never unearthly beauty).

1.  *Extra arm:* When the escalation die is odd, the fomorian can make
    one extra melee attack per round as a quick action.

2.  *Extra eyes:* The fomorian has a cluster of small eyes in the back
    of its head, a huge eye on a shoulder, a slug-like eye stalk, etc.
    The fomorian can't be surprised or ambushed, and it has *true sight*
    (spells like *blur*, *invisibility*, etc. don't work on it).

3.  *Fair is foul:* Once per turn as a free action, the fomorian can
    make the following attack:

> **C: Evil eye +11 vs. PD (one nearby or faraway enemy, but not one
> that has been targeted by this attack since the start of the last
> round)**---10 ongoing damage, and the target's skin and bones
> painfully twist to make them hideous to behold. At the start of each
> day, provided they receive some form of magical healing, the twisted
> victim rolls a save with a bonus equal to their Charisma or
> Constitution modifier (whichever is lower) to recover their original
> appearance.
>
> *Limited use:* Once one target has been hit by this attack, no further
> *evil eye* attacks can be made by any fomorian this battle.

4.  *Thick skin:* +1 AC and +2 PD.

[True-Fomori Houses Nastier Specials]{.underline}

Each of the greater fomori had many offspring, the true-fomori. While
true-fomori are each unique you can usually tell which calde a
true-fomori originated in.

Use the following nastier special groups when you want to summon on the
offspring of a specific greater fomori. You can also add in some
fomorian mutations and unclean-one abilities if you like.

[House of Songs]{.underline}

These fomori sing songs that drive listeners to insanity.

*Song of the House:* When the escalation die is odd, the enemy with the
highest MD must roll a save at the start of the round. If it fails, it's
confused until the end of its next turn. When the escalation die is
even, the same effect applies to the enemy with the lowest MD. The
fomori chooses if enemies are tied for highest or lowest MD.

*Ear-bleed:* The ears of all non-fomori creatures in the battle begin to
bleed, and continue to do so until the end of the day. Until the next
full heal-up, those creatures take a --4 penalty to skill checks
involving social situations or detecting sounds.

*Discordancy:* The first time each battle the true fomori is staggered,
each of its enemies in the battle is hampered until the end of its next
turn.

[House of Eyes]{.underline}

These fomori usually have lots of eyes, or a single prominent eye, and
fly by hovering.

*Hovering flight:* This creature flies, its host's unwashed and diseased
feet hovering inches above the ground.

*Eye beam:* Once per turn as a quick action, the fomori can fire a
powerful ray from one or more of its eyes.

**R: Eye beam +5 +fomori's level vs. PD**---7 ongoing force damage
(champion: 14 damage; epic: 21 damage)

*Natural 16+:* The target pops free from enemies it's engaged with and
can't engage any enemies until it saves against the ongoing force
damage.

*Eye theft:* When a creature is staggered, it begins to feel as if its
eyes are being pulled out by an invisible force. It takes a --1 penalty
to hit and damage. Enemies that die in the presence of this fomori do
indeed have their eyes sucked out as the fomori absorbs the eyeballs.

[House of Nightmares]{.underline}

These fomori shift their forms instinctually, constantly devolving into
ever-more horrible creatures.

*Shifting from Nightmares:* When the true-fomori is hit by an attack
that targets PD or MD, until the start of its next turn, the values of
its PD and MD switch and it gains a bonus to AC equal to the escalation
die.

*Nightmares:* After a battle with the fomori, the character with the
lowest MD (randomly choose on a tie) has a nightmare during the
following night, with a 50% chance that the nightmare somehow comes true
the next day.

*Skin theft:* You know that trick with the tablecloth? When the
true-fomori scores a critical hit, it does that to some of its target's
skin, and the target is stunned (save ends). Replacing the skin might
take more than normal healing, too, and it might take a while to look
right on a creature again.

[House of Spiders]{.underline}

These true-fomori tend to have lots of legs and can control spiders,
scorpions, ticks, and other arachnids.

*Scuttle:* The true-fomori can climb like a spider and squeeze its body
down to scuttle swiftly under low openings.

*Bite:* Once per turn as a quick action, the true-fomori can make the
following attack to inject acid into its victim and drink its innards.

**Draining bite +5 + fomori's level vs. AC**---7 acid damage (champion:
14 damage; epic: 21 damage)

*Natural 16+:* The target heals using a recovery, but the true-fomori
gains the hit points.

*Sun-eating:* A creature staggered by this fomori can no longer see the
sun the following day and must rely on lantern light or magical
illumination. There is a 50% chance each day thereafter that the
adventurer recovers and can once again see sunlight and feels its
warmth. While a creature is unable to see or feel the healing sun,
whenever it rolls recovery dice, it must reroll any die that has the
maximum result (for example, a 10 on a d10).

[House of Colors]{.underline}

These true-fomori have plumage or fur in unnatural madness-causing
colors.

*Color out of time:* An enemy making a ranged attack against the
true-fomori takes a penalty to the attack equal to the escalation die
and can't use the escalation die for that attack.

*Color drain:* When the true-fomori drops a creature to 0 hp or lower,
that creature is drained of all color and can no longer perceive color.
While under this effect, the creature takes a --4 penalty to social
skill checks and a --1 penalty to saves. Restoring color to the creature
requires a quest involving walking a sacred labyrinth.

|          | that can see or hear it, and also heals 5 hp if  |   |   |
|          | at least one unclean-one can see or hear it.     |   |   |

|          | Whichever result is highest determines the       | * |   |
|          | true-fomori's effect on local reality for that   |   |   |
|          | round. (If there are multiple true-fomori in the | * |   |
|          | battle, only roll for one per round.)            | * |   |

|          | **2--3: Deeper insanity**---When an enemy        |   |   |
|          | target's the fomori's MD and gets a natural odd  |   |   |
|          | attack roll, the attack rebounds and that enemy  |   |   |
|          | must reroll the attack against itself.           |   |   |

|          | from the adventurers' attack rolls.              |   |   |
|          |                                                  |   |   |
|          | **6: Doom**---The fomori and its allies use the  |   |   |
|          | escalation die and the adventurers do not.       |   |   |
|          |                                                  |   |   |
|          | *Fear aura:* Enemies engaged with the            |   |   |
|          | true-fomori who have 120 hp or fewer are dazed   |   |   |
|          | (--4 to attack) and cannot use the escalation    |   |   |
|          | die.                                             |   |   |

|          | *Power from worship:* At the start of its turn,  |   |   |
|          | the fomori torturer heals 5 hp for each fomorian |   |   |
|          | that can see or hear it, and also heals 5 hp if  |   |   |
|          | at least one unclean-one can see or hear it.     |   |   |
|          | This effect affects the fomori even if it's      |   |   |
|          | dead, healing it from 0 hp.                      |   |   |

### Frogfolk

[Special Abilities for All Frogspawn]{.underline}

You should certainly use one ability per frogspawn, occasionally two.
For frogspawn mooks, treat the abilities as usable once per battle.

*Disgusting tongue:* The frogspawn deals poison damage equal to its
level to any character that pops free of it or successfully disengages
from it. (Teleporting away is probably tongue-free unless the GM is
hopping mad.)

*Dunk and cover:* If the battle is taking place in a swamp, lake, or
river, whenever the frogspawn misses with a natural even attack roll, it
can duck out of sight. Remove the frogspawn from the table until the
start of its next turn. At the start of its next turn, place it anywhere
nearby its previous location, but not engaged with an enemy.

*Erratic leap (move action):* If the frogspawn is unengaged at the start
of its turn, choose a random nearby enemy the frogspawn can see. The
frogspawn leaps into engagement with that enemy and its crit range with
melee attacks expands by 3 until the end of the turn.

*Paranoid destroyer:* This frogspawn can't be surprised. If there's a
surprise round, it gets to act. If there isn't a surprise round at the
start of combat, the frogspawn gets a surprise round if its natural
initiative roll is 16+. On the down side, subtract 2 from this
frogspawn's MD, because it's always sure it's going to die. (Gamemaster:
Don't give this ability to all the frogspawn in a battle. Just one or
two.)

|          | attack or moving, roll a d6 to see what the      | * |   |
|          | cubahedron does. If an option is not viable (you |   |   |
|          | roll a 5 but there is no engulfed enemy), reroll |   |   |
|          | until you get a valid option.                    |   |   |
|          |                                                  |   |   |
|          | **1.** The cubahedron jiggles in place. Each     |   |   |
|          | nearby enemy takes 5 acid damage. Each creature  |   |   |
|          | engulfed by the cube takes a --4 penalty to its  |   |   |
|          | saves until the end of its next turn.            |   |   |
|          |                                                  |   |   |
|          | **2.** The cubahedron moves as a quick action.   |   |   |
|          | If the cube ends its move engaged with enemies,  |   |   |
|          | each of those enemies must roll a save; on a     |   |   |
|          | failure, the cubahedron grabs them (but they're  |   |   |
|          | not engulfed).                                   |   |   |
|          |                                                  |   |   |
|          | **3.** The cubahedron spits an engulfed creature |   |   |
|          | into the air above it and makes a                |   |   |
|          | *shlup'n'schlorp* attack against that creature   |   |   |
|          | with a +5 attack bonus. Then the creature is     |   |   |
|          | engulfed again.                                  |   |   |
|          |                                                  |   |   |
|          | **4.** The cubahedron flattens itself slightly   |   |   |
|          | and crawls up a wall and possibly across the     |   |   |
|          | ceiling. The cube falls at the end of its turn.  |   |   |
|          | Each creature engulfed by the cube takes 30      |   |   |
|          | damage, and it makes a *gel drop* attack against |   |   |
|          | enemies below it.                                |   |   |
|          |                                                  |   |   |
|          | **Gel drop +10 vs. PD (1d3 nearby                |   |   |
|          | enemies)**---15 damage, and the cube engulfs the |   |   |
|          | target if it's smaller than the cube             |   |   |
|          |                                                  |   |   |
|          | **5.** The cubahedron moves one creature         |   |   |
|          | engulfed by it to the surface. The target gains  |   |   |
|          | a +4 bonus to attempts to escape the cube, but   |   |   |
|          | each time the cube is targeted by an attack, the |   |   |
|          | engulfed creature must roll a save; on a         |   |   |
|          | failure, it becomes the target of the attack     |   |   |
|          | instead.                                         |   |   |
|          |                                                  |   |   |
|          | **6.** The cubahedron spits out each enemy       |   |   |
|          | engulfed by it with great force in different     |   |   |
|          | directions; each of those creatures takes 50     |   |   |
|          | damage.                                          |   |   |

|          | *Each failed save:* Acid destroys one of the     |   |   |

|          | the battle (boots fall apart, shield straps      |   |   |
|          | snap, etc.).                                     |   |   |

|          | **2.** The octahedron grows an orifice that      |   |   |
|          | gushes out a liquid glue that floods the area.   |   |   |
|          | Each enemy engaged with the octahedron is stuck  |   |   |
|          | (hard save ends, 16+). Each nearby enemy not     |   |   |
|          | engaged with the octahedron is stuck (save       |   |   |
|          | ends). Each faraway enemy is stuck (easy save    |   |   |
|          | ends, 6+). The glue has no effect on creatures   |   |   |
|          | who are flying or that have some way of avoiding |   |   |
|          | it.                                              |   |   |

|          | **3.** The octahedron squirts a slick slime that |   |   |
|          | targets 1d3 nearby enemies. Until the end of the |   |   |
|          | battle, each target must roll an easy save each  |   |   |
|          | time it moves; on a failure, it's hampered until |   |   |
|          | the end of its next turn.                        |   |   |

|          | **4.** The octahedron makes a *fire gout* attack |   |   |
|          | as it splashes out a gel that ignites in the air |   |   |
|          | and sticks to skin and clothing.                 |   |   |
|          |                                                  |   |   |

|          | *Each failed save:* The ongoing damage for all   |   |   |

|          | **5.** The octahedron sweats acid. Each enemy    |   |   |
|          | engaged with the octahedron must roll a normal   |   |   |
|          | save; on a failure, it takes 40 acid damage. On  |   |   |
|          | a success it takes 20 acid damage.               |   |   |

|          | octahedron is propelled uncontrollably about the |   |   |
|          | area, passing next to each of its enemies.       |   |   |
|          | Unlike normal, each enemy can make an            |   |   |
|          | opportunity attack against the ooze as it moves  |   |   |
|          | this way, but the ooze can make a *glomp* attack |   |   |
|          | against those who do as a free action as it      |   |   |
|          | passes. (Tell the PCs that the ooze will get a   |   |   |
|          | counter-attack.)                                 |   |   |

|          | **8.** The octahedron splits into two            |   |   |
|          | tetrahedrons, and each one can act this turn     |   |   |
|          | (roll a d4 for the instinctive actions of each   |   |   |
|          | one). Divide the octahedron's current hit points |   |   |
|          | equally between the two new creatures.           |   |   |

|            | and shlorps around the area. Any enemies       |   |    |
|            | already engulfed by the dodecahedron take 10   |   |    |
|            | thunder damage.                                |   |    |
|            |                                                |   |    |
|            | **C: Squash +10 vs. PD (1d4 nearby             |   |    |
|            | enemies)**---20 damage, and the target is      |   |    |
|            | stunned (easy save ends, 6+)                   |   |    |
|            |                                                |   |    |
|            | **2.** The dodecahedron throws out whip-like   |   |    |
|            | tendrils and makes a *sudden orifice* attack   |   |    |
|            | against each enemy engaged with it. Then it    |   |    |
|            | pulls each nearby enemy next to it and engages |   |    |
|            | that creature.                                 |   |    |
|            |                                                |   |    |
|            | **Sudden orifice +12 vs. PD (each enemy        |   |    |
|            | engaged with it)**---The dodecahedron engulfs  |   |    |
|            | the target if it's smaller than the            |   |    |
|            | dodecahedron                                   |   |    |
|            |                                                |   |    |
|            | **3.** Hundreds of finger-size slimes slither  |   |    |
|            | out from the interior of the dodecahedron and  |   |    |
|            | begin worming their way across the bodies of   |   |    |
|            | each of its enemies in the battle. Until the   |   |    |
|            | end of the battle, when a non-ooze creature    |   |    |
|            | takes any damage besides ongoing acid damage,  |   |    |
|            | it also takes 10 acid damage.                  |   |    |
|            |                                                |   |    |
|            | **4.** The dodecahedron bounces and thrums.    |   |    |
|            | Each enemy engaged with it or engulfed by it   |   |    |
|            | must roll a save; on a failure, that enemy     |   |    |
|            | takes 30 thunder damage. On a success, it      |   |    |
|            | takes 15 thunder damage and pops free from the |   |    |
|            | dodecahedron.                                  |   |    |
|            |                                                |   |    |
|            | **5.** The dodecahedron hunkers down and       |   |    |
|            | produces acidic spikes. It gains a +4 bonus to |   |    |
|            | all defenses until the end of the battle, and  |   |    |
|            | each enemy who makes a melee attack against it |   |    |
|            | with a non-magical weapon must roll a save; on |   |    |
|            | a failure the weapon dissolves. When a         |   |    |
|            | creature's weapon dissolves, that creature is  |   |    |
|            | hampered and weakened (save ends both).        |   |    |
|            | Magical weapons lose their bonuses to hit and  |   |    |
|            | damage until the end of the battle instead of  |   |    |
|            | being dissolved (but the owner is still        |   |    |
|            | hampered and weakened). They can be "restored" |   |    |
|            | after the battle by taking a few minutes       |   |    |
|            | during a rest to re-attune them.               |   |    |
|            |                                                |   |    |
|            | **6.** The dodecahedron moves, rolling around  |   |    |
|            | the battlefield, then makes a                  |   |    |
|            | *shlup'n'schlorp* attack at the end of its     |   |    |
|            | movement with a +5 bonus. If the attack        |   |    |
|            | misses, instead of making a *spasms* attack    |   |    |
|            | the dodecahedron rolls about the area again    |   |    |
|            | and makes a second *shlup'n'schlorp* attack    |   |    |
|            | with a +10 bonus. If the second attack misses, |   |    |
|            | it doesn't get a spasms attack and the         |   |    |
|            | dodecahedron's turn ends.                      |   |    |
|            |                                                |   |    |
|            | **7.** The dodecahedron makes a *spasms*       |   |    |
|            | attack. If it misses with either attack roll,  |   |    |
|            | after the attacks, it can make a *stretch and  |   |    |
|            | engulf* attack as a free action.               |   |    |
|            |                                                |   |    |
|            | **C: Stretch and engulf +12 vs. PD (one nearby |   |    |
|            | or faraway enemy)**---30 acid damage, and the  |   |    |
|            | dodecahedron engulfs the target if it's        |   |    |
|            | smaller than the dodecahedron                  |   |    |
|            |                                                |   |    |
|            | **8. C: Pseudopod slaps +10 vs. AC (one nearby |   |    |
|            | enemy)**---25 thunder damage                   |   |    |
|            |                                                |   |    |
|            | *Natural odd hit:* The target pops free from   |   |    |
|            | the dodecahedron and is knocked faraway, and   |   |    |
|            | the ooze makes the attack again against a      |   |    |
|            | different nearby enemy as a free action.       |   |    |
|            |                                                |   |    |
|            | *Natural even hit:* The dodecahedron engulfs   |   |    |
|            | the target if it's smaller than the            |   |    |
|            | dodecahedron.                                  |   |    |
|            |                                                |   |    |
|            | **9.** Each enemy engulfed by the dodecahedron |   |    |
|            | takes 40 acid damage, and the dodecahedron     |   |    |
|            | heals 40 hp for each enemy it has engulfed.    |   |    |
|            |                                                |   |    |
|            | **10.** The dodecahedron splits into an        |   |    |
|            | octahedron and a tetrahedron, and each one can |   |    |
|            | act this turn (roll a d8 and d4 for the        |   |    |
|            | *instinctive actions* of each one). Divide the |   |    |
|            | dodecahedron's current hit points into thirds, |   |    |
|            | and give one third to the tetrahedron and two  |   |    |
|            | thirds to the octahedron.                      |   |    |
|            |                                                |   |    |
|            | **11.** The dodecahedron splits into three     |   |    |
|            | tetrahedrons, and each one can act this turn   |   |    |
|            | (roll a d4 for the *instinctive actions* of    |   |    |
|            | each one). Divide the dodecahedron's current   |   |    |
|            | hit points equally between the three new       |   |    |
|            | creatures.                                     |   |    |
|            |                                                |   |    |
|            | **12.** The dodecahedron splits into two       |   |    |
|            | cubahedrons, and each one can act this turn    |   |    |
|            | (roll a d6 for the *instinctive actions* of    |   |    |
|            | each one). Divide the dodecahedron's current   |   |    |
|            | hit points equally between the two new         |   |    |
|            | creatures.                                     |   |    |

|          | already has a positive or conflicted             |   |   |
|          | relationship with. Treat this advantage as if it |   |   |
|          | came from a positive relationship. The GM is     |   |   |
|          | encouraged to treat this result with the utmost  |   |   |
|          | benevolence and compassion.                      |   |   |
|          |                                                  |   |   |

### Ghost

[Abilities for Most Ghosts]{.underline}

Most ghosts have several or all of the following abilities. Normally we
use these sections to cover abilities possessed by all the monsters of a
certain type, but there's enough variation in ghost stories that we
figure we should provide tools for you to choose from rather than try to
force ghosts into one style of haunting.

For the record, all ghosts also have some version of the *ghostly*
ability, but its strength varies so we've put it into each stat block.

*Bound hauntings:* Most ghosts are bound to an area, usually the area of
their death. This ability won't come up much in play, but it does make
it seem likely that ghosts can be easier to get away from than other
monsters. Move far enough fast enough and the ghost returns to the area
it's bound to. Occasionally festivals for the dead or other rituals can
call bound ghosts from their hauntings, but those are unusual and
temporary circumstances.

**Exceptions:** There may be ghosts that are bound to people, or events,
or phenomena that travel. There might even be ghosts that aren't bound
to anything, but at that stage there are several other questions that
surface and odd magical, iconic, or unique intervention seems likely.

*Flight:* Most ghosts fly, though some may be quite slow, seeming to
drift or walking on air. Ghosts that fly in unusual ways will be flagged
with their own abilities.

**Exceptions:** Not all ghosts fly. Some seem constrained to act much
like they acted when they were alive, and flying wasn't part of their
life package.

*Unnatural touch:* Many ghosts can alter the temperature of their
environment to more closely match the underworld or afterlife that
they've so far evaded. Sometimes that's icy cold, sometimes that's
burning hot, and sometimes it's just kind of normal, which would go
unnoticed unless the ghost is somewhere abnormal!

**Exceptions:** This is more of a special effect of ghost stories than
part of a creature's combat abilities, and you can safely ignore it
unless you find telling moments when it adds to the game.

### Ghoul

For nastier specials, instead of a slow, poisonous bite, a more deadly
bite can also make things challenging for adventurers. Each time a ghoul
bites a character, that PC immediately loses a recovery. If they run out
of recoveries before their next full heal-up, that character must start
making last gasp saves at the start of each battle. If the character
fails their fourth last gasp save this way, they turn into a ghoul.

### Gibbering Mouther

[Abilities for All Gibbering Mouthers]{.underline}

Gibbering mouthers have the following abilities:

*Eyes everywhere:* Gibbering mouthers can't be ambushed or sneaked up
on.

In addition, though gibbering mouthers are aberrations they are
ooze-like enough that they use the ooze abilities flows where it likes
and ooze.

*Flows where it likes:* The gibbering mouther is immune to opportunity
attacks.

*Ooze:* The gibbering mouther is immune to effects. When an attack
applies a condition to a gibbering mouther (dazed, hampered, weakened,
ongoing damage, etc.), that condition doesn't affect it.

|          | Each marble golem is infused with *two*          | * |   |

|          | sculpture as its dominant theme. Choose two      | * |   |
|          | virtues from the list below, or for a unique     | * |   |
|          | marble golem, invent your own.                   | H |   |

|          | *Awe (fear effect):* While nearby the golem,     | * |   |
|          | enemies with 40 hp or fewer are dazed (--4       | * |   |
|          | attack) and do not add the escalation die to     |   |   |
|          | their attacks.                                   |   |   |
|          |                                                  |   |   |
|          | *Beauty:* The first time each enemy attacks the  |   |   |
|          | marble golem this battle, it must roll a normal  |   |   |
|          | save; on a failure, the attack takes a --6       |   |   |
|          | penalty.                                         |   |   |
|          |                                                  |   |   |
|          | *Courage:* While staggered, the marble golem     |   |   |
|          | adds the escalation die to its attack rolls.     |   |   |
|          |                                                  |   |   |
|          | *Endurance:* When the marble golem rolls a       |   |   |
|          | natural 1--5 with an attack roll, it heals 1d10  |   |   |
|          | hit points per point on the escalation die. (It  |   |   |
|          | was checking for damage and got distracted.)     |   |   |
|          |                                                  |   |   |
|          | *Hatred:* When an enemy is staggered by the      |   |   |
|          | marble golem's attack, that enemy takes 4d10     |   |   |
|          | extra damage.                                    |   |   |

|          | *Patience:* Each turn, the marble golem can use  |   |   |
|          | one standard action to gain a +2 bonus to all    |   |   |
|          | defenses until the start of its next turn. If it |   |   |
|          | does, it gains an extra standard action during   |   |   |
|          | its next turn.                                   |   |   |

|          | *Protection:* When the marble golem rolls a      |   |   |
|          | natural 16+ with an attack, decrease the         |   |   |
|          | escalation die by 1.                             |   |   |
|          |                                                  |   |   |
|          | *Strength:* The marble golem's melee attacks now |   |   |
|          | deal half damage on a miss.                      |   |   |

|          | *More virtues:* Statues that capture even more   |   |   |
|          | themes make stronger marble golems. Add one or   |   |   |
|          | two more virtues to the golem.                   |   |   |

### Hag

Hags get two of the following abilities, and a single death curse.

[Hag Abilities: Choose TWO]{.underline}

**Adept Illusionist:** The hag gains a +5 bonus to initiative checks due
to being not quite where she seems.

*Hag ability:* As a distraction, the hag creates an illusion of her
doing one thing, when she is in fact setting a trap. The hag throws out
a bear-trap or other impediment and one nearby enemy becomes stuck (save
ends). While stuck this way, the target takes 6 damage at the start of
each of its turns.

**Another skin:** On the hag's first round of combat each battle, she
gains a +2 attack bonus due to her victims being shocked as she bursts
out of her false outer skin.

*Hag ability:* The hag coughs up a glob of liquid pseudo-flesh that
globs onto a nearby enemy (no attack roll). The glob solidifies causing
an effect of the hag's choice: the target is stuck (save ends); OR the
target is unable to cast spells during its next turn (the pseudo-flesh
covers their mouth and face).

**Blood pact:** Each creature allied to the hag through a pact gains a
+2 bonus with their first attack each battle if the hag is present.

*Hag ability:* The hag spits blood in the face of the target and makes a
command. The target must roll an immediate save; on a failure, as a free
action it makes basic attack against an ally or against itself (target's
choice).

**Breath stealing:** The hag starts combat with 10 temporary hit points.

*Hag ability:* The hag steals a recovery from the target and heals 20
hp.

**Death shriek:** When a melee attack hits the hag, she lets out a
shriek as a free action and the attacker takes 2d4 thunder damage.

*Hag ability:* The hag begins to shriek, and each enemy in the battle
takes a --4 attack penalty with spells until the start of her next turn.

**Dusk walk:** Once per day the hag can implant a suggestion in the mind
of a target sleeping within a day's travel of her. The hag rolls an
attack: **+10 vs. MD**; on a hit, she implants a suggestion in the
target that they must obey when a condition she chooses is met.
Suggested actions can't cause direct harm (the target can't be forced to
fight another or harm themselves), can be no longer than 12 words, and
affects the target for a week or until triggered. GM keeps the roll
hidden.

*Hag ability:* The hag becomes immaterial, pops free from all enemies
engaged with her, and enters the land of dreams, re-appearing next to
any nearby conscious creature (or a nearby or faraway creature that is
unconscious). The hag then makes the following attack: **C: +10 vs. MD
(each nearby unconscious enemy)**---The hag implants a suggestion in the
target that they must obey when they become conscious (usually "When you
awake, flee this fight and discard your equipment.") Suggested actions
can't cause direct harm. The round after the target acts on the
implanted suggestion it can start rolling normal saves to throw off the
effect.

**Fateful visions:** The hag uses a +2 magical weapon traded to her for
her services (she gains a +2 bonus to attack and damage with melee
attacks).

*Hag ability:* The hag has seen this fight in a vision. Her crit range
expands by 2 until the end of the battle. Each increase is cumulative.

**Foul-touched:** When an enemy is battling the hag, at the start of
each of its turns, it takes 2d6 psychic damage from the horror of the
hag's visage unless it takes precautions to avoid directly glancing at
her terrible face (mirror, blindfold, etc., which might cause attack
penalties).

*Hag ability:* The hag chooses a nearby enemy and glares at it. That
target must roll an immediate save; on a failure, the target is stricken
blind by her ugliness. While blinded this way, the target is hampered,
weakened, and can't make ranged attacks. The target can end the effect
by splashing liquid into their eyes or using a similar act to clear the
ugly out as a standard action.

**Song of dreams:** Enemies take a --4 penalty to their initiative rolls
in battles with the hag.

*Hag ability:* The hag begins to sing and the two enemies closest to her
(even if faraway) must roll an immediate save; on a failure, the target
is dazed (save ends). If the dazed target fails its first save, instead
it's weakened (save ends). If the weakened target fails its second save,
instead it's helpless (save ends).

**Thief of mist:** The hag ignores opportunity attacks and can't be
intercepted while moving.

*Hag ability:* The hag becomes a mist until the start of her next turn.
While a mist, only spells cast with a +3 implement and attacks using a
+3 magical weapon can harm her. (Some special story item might also
allow attacks to hit if no PC has a +3 item.)

**Twist the path:** Once per day the hag can enspell an area to attract
visitors, causing those traveling nearby to get lost and wander to that
location. Alternately, the hag can cause the location to repel visitors.
Finding the correct path to that location requires a DC 20 check if it
is a familiar place, a DC 25 check if the travelers only have a map or
guide, or a DC 30 check if the travelers are unfamiliar with the area.

*Hag ability:* The target is also confused (easy save ends, 6+).

**Weakening touch:** Each enemy fighting the hag must roll a normal save
at the start of the battle; on a failure, that creature starts the
battle weakened (easy save ends, 6+).

*Hag ability:* The target is dazed (save ends). If the dazed target
fails its first save, instead it's weakened (save ends). When the target
saves against this effect, it takes a --2 attack penalty until the end
of its next turn.

**Winter breath:** The hag's attacks deal cold damage.

*Hag ability:* The target takes 6 ongoing cold damage.

[Death Curses: Create ONE]{.underline}

When a hag dies she curses the one who killed her. The only known way to
remove the curse is to seek the aid of another hag, though there may be
some ways to end such a curse that are not readily known.

Create one curse per hag. A good curse makes life horribly weird for a
character, but isn't something that debilitates them. Avoid ones that
blind, deafen, cripple, or mute characters. Odd habits, ugly features,
unusual smells, strange and disgusting diets---all these are good. They
should make the character and the story more interesting.

|          | hag's choice (but not a fourth with another      |   |   |
|          | 18+).                                            | * |   |

|          | *Death curse:* Each hag can lay a curse upon the | H |   |
|          | one who ends its horrible life. After dropping   | P |   |
|          | to 0 hit points, a hag always lingers long       | * |   |
|          | enough to pronounce the words of the curse. (See | * |   |
|          | Death Curses.)                                   |   |   |

|          | *Delusionist:* All hags have the ability to      |   |   |
|          | twist the perceptions of others. If the hag has  |   |   |
|          | a short time to prepare, it can hide a small     |   |   |
|          | hut, disguise a volunteer or captive as a        |   |   |
|          | monster, disguise itself as a harmless peasant   |   |   |
|          | woman, etc. A DC 30 skill check is required to   |   |   |
|          | overcome the delusion and see the truth of it    |   |   |
|          | (if a player gives a reason for not trusting     |   |   |
|          | what their character sees; perhaps add subtle    |   |   |
|          | clues toward that end). The magic fades as soon  |   |   |
|          | as the hag enters combat.                        |   |   |
|          |                                                  |   |   |
|          | *Fear:* While engaged with this creature,        |   |   |
|          | enemies with 30 hp or fewer are dazed (--4       |   |   |
|          | attack) and do not add the escalation die to     |   |   |
|          | their attacks.                                   |   |   |

### Hallowed Gargoyle

[Nastier Specials for all Hallowed Gargoyles]{.underline}

These nastier specials also apply to temple lions.

*Mirrored aggression:* Hallowed gargoyles have some ability to sense
intentions and a larger capacity to react appropriately! PCs with a
negative or conflicted relationship with the Religious Icon are
vulnerable to all the hallowed gargoyles' attacks.

*Statues, statues, everywhere:* Because they look so much like statues,
and because most of the things that look like hallowed gargoyles are
statues, hallowed gargoyles are capable of springing a surprise on
inattentive PCs. When there's a chance of such an ambush, give the PCs a
normal skill check (DC 20 at champion-tier, DC 25 at epic tier) to
notice the gargoyles waking and avoid being surprised (13^th^ Age core
rulebook, page 164).

### Hellwarped Beast

[Aberrant Attack Table]{.underline}

Roll a d6 to determine what type of additional attack(s) the hellwarped
beast has, and its general characteristics. Use the first set of stats
for the brutes, and the second for the spawn.

**1. Biting mandibles +15/+11 vs. AC**---50/13 damage, and the target is
stuck (save ends); while the target is stuck this way, at the start of
the hellwarped's turn, it automatically deals 50/13 damage to the target
but can't make an *aberrant attack* that turn.

**2. Extra claw +15/+11 vs. AC**---75/19 damage (and the claw can
benefit from the *dual miss* effect).

**3. Lashing tentacle +15/+11 vs. PD**---20/5 damage, and the target is
weakened (save ends); the first time the target fails this save, it
becomes stunned instead (save ends).

**4. C: Antennae waveburst +15/+11 vs. MD (one nearby enemy)**---20/5
psychic damage, and the target must roll an immediate save. If it fails,
it's confused until the end of its next turn.

**5. R: Shooting quills +15/+11 vs. AC (one nearby enemy not engaged
with it)**---40/10 damage. In addition, it takes only half damage from
opportunity attacks thanks to the spikes covering it.

**6.** *\[use only when triggered as an aberrant attack\]* **Charging
horn slam +15/+11 vs. PD**---50/13 damage, and the target is dazed (save
ends).

> *Free charge:* The hellwarped pops free from each enemy engaged with
> it after making its *claws* attacks, then moves to a nearby enemy as a
> free action and makes this attack.

### Horned Azinth

Due to the horned azinth's ability to move about undetected, it's likely
that the adventurers are going to run into trouble with them by
accidentally wandering into the midst of a herd. If that happens, the
horned azinth will ambush the heroes. Use this variant on the standard
ambush and surprise rules.

First, 1d3 + 1 horned azinth get to act before initiative is rolled
instead of only two of the beasts. Second, if you normally advance the
escalation die at the end of the surprise round, don't do it. The azinth
are too well concealed for momentum to favor the heroes.

#### Chaos Hydra

This hydra starts with four heads, but they're not always the same
heads! Roll a d6 four times before the fight begins to find out which
heads the chaos hydra starts the battle with. A head that starts the
fight may not finish the battle, heads shift mid-fight, and as usual for
hydras, new heads sprout when the creature takes serious damage.

*One attack per head:* As for the more generic hydras, each of the chaos
hydra's heads can make an attack when it uses a standard action. Unlike
those other hydras, each separate head is going to have its own attack
style, though it's possible that the hydra will randomly have two or
more of the same type of head for a couple rounds!

*Heads with bonuses:* A few of the heads provide abilities or bonuses as
well as one or two possible attacks. For a change, these bonuses are
cumulative. For example, a chaos hydra with two draconic heads would
have a +4 bonus to its AC. Since the heads shift frequently, those
bonuses won't last forever.

|          | can use any of its teeth attacks against nearby  |   |   |
|          | creatures it can see and get to, but has a -2    |   |   |
|          | attack penalty when using teeth attacks against  |   |   |

|          | full damage against creatures it has not already |   |   |
|          | hit this turn. If the chaos hydra attacks a      |   |   |
|          | creature it has hit earlier in the turn, the     |   |   |
|          | attack only deals half damage, hit or miss or    |   |   |

|          | *Too tough to trick:* Whenever the chaos hydra   |   |   |
|          | would suffer any of the following conditions, it |   |   |
|          | ignores the condition and takes 10 damage        |   |   |
|          | instead: confused, dazed, hampered, stunned, or  |   |   |
|          | weakened.                                        |   |   |

|          | *Sprout fifth head:* The first time the hydra is |   |   |
|          | staggered, as a free action it gains 70 hit      |   |   |
|          | points and a random fifth head. Roll 1d6 to      |   |   |
|          | determine which head. The chaos hydra is         |   |   |
|          | considered undamaged at its new hit point total. |   |   |
|          | Using the hydra's current hit points as a new    |   |   |
|          | baseline, the hydra will be staggered again when |   |   |
|          | it drops below 50% of that total.                |   |   |
|          |                                                  |   |   |
|          | *Sprout sixth head:* The second time the hydra   |   |   |
|          | is staggered, as a free action it gains 70 hit   |   |   |
|          | points and a random sixth head, etc. Use a new   |   |   |
|          | hit point baseline as before, but there is no    |   |   |
|          | seventh head waiting to sprout.                  |   |   |

### Kobold

All kobolds have the *trapster* ability. When a kobold makes a
*trapster* attack and rolls a natural attack roll that is higher than
the target's Wisdom, the creature has maneuvered the target into a trap
with the attack. A creature can only be subjected to one trap per round.

When a kobold triggers its *trapster* ability, determine the damage the
trap deals by rolling a 1d4, then adding the escalation die. If there's
a dungeon-shaman in the battle, use a d8 instead of a d4.

Kobold traps can deal ongoing damage to the target instead of regular
damage, if that makes sense for the trap. For ongoing damage, roll 1d4
(or 1d8) plus the escalation die, and then subtract one (minimum 1).

Kobold traps can impose conditions upon the target, if you choose. Roll
normal trap damage, but the trap only deals half damage (minimum 1).
Then roll a d4 for the condition the trap imposes upon the target until
the end of its next turn.

1.  The target is stuck.

2.  The target is hampered.

3.  The target is dazed.

4.  The target is vulnerable.

Trap types vary according to the location/terrain and the whim of the
GM.

|          | mob can choose whether to make the attack or    | * |    |
|          | not. Any who don't use it, lose it.             | * |    |
|          |                                                 | M |    |
|          | *Home turf tricks:* The first time each enemy   | D |    |
|          | in a battle attacks a glinter mob, it must roll | * |    |
|          | a save; on a failure, that attack is negated.   | * |    |
|          | The glinters have traps, hidden weapons, trick  |   |    |
|          | furniture, and other resources that they can    | * |    |
|          | use against attackers. Improvise some trick,    | * |    |
|          | ideally involving scorpions, that either        | H |    |
|          | protects the kobolds from the attack or         | P |    |
|          | interferes with the attacker, assuming the      | * |    |
|          | glinters are on familiar ground.                | * |    |
|          |                                                 |   |    |
|          | *Stubborn resilience:* Whenever three or more   |   |    |
|          | glinters drop from a single attack (possibly    |   |    |
|          | involving multiple attack rolls), one-third of  |   |    |
|          | those glinters are undamaged instead (round     |   |    |
|          | down).                                          |   |    |

|          | *Free-form ability---Unstoppability:* Glinters  |   |    |
|          | can pour through small openings in large        |   |    |
|          | numbers, crowd into tight spaces, scramble over |   |    |
|          | or through obstacles, and otherwise get into    |   |    |
|          | places faster than you would believe. This      |   |    |
|          | trait helps them overwhelm enemies with numbers |   |    |
|          | that the unfortunate targets don't believes is  |   |    |
|          | possible.                                       |   |    |

|          | *Bitter resolve:* When a glinter mob is reduced |   |    |
|          | to half its number or less, the surviving       |   |    |

|          | *Coordinated strike:* Once per battle as a free |   |    |
|          | action, the glinter mob can utter a war cry in  |   |    |
|          | unison and each member of the mob gains a +4    |   |    |
|          | attack bonus that turn.                         |   |    |

### Kohwa

[Abilities for all kohwa]{.underline}

*Flight:* Kohwa are winged, and therefore capable of flight. While they
are strong fliers and able to travel great distances in this way, they
are acutely aware of how ungainly they look while doing so, and
therefore prefer to walk or run unless they are certain no one is
watching.

*Swimming:* Unlike many cat species, kohwa are perfectly at home in the
water, so diving into a lake or river is a poor defense against them.

*Telepathy:* Kohwa are capable of short-range telepathy with non-kohwa.
It is assumed (although no one is entirely sure) that they are capable
of communicating with others of their species at greater distances, as
when one is in trouble, others are sure to appear---eventually.

|          | *Invocation of the gods' protection:* Once per   | H |   |
|          | battle, as a quick action, the kohwa messenger   | P |   |
|          | can invoke the protection of their unknown gods. | * |   |
|          | Once the invocation has been made, at the start  | * |   |
|          | of each of the messenger's turns, roll 1d6. As   |   |   |
|          | long as the roll is equal to or less than the    |   |   |
|          | escalation die, critical hits against the        |   |   |
|          | messenger and its allies only inflict normal     |   |   |
|          | damage (although they do still trigger the kohwa |   |   |
|          | enforcer's *acid rain* attack, if appropriate).  |   |   |
|          | As soon as the roll fails, the protection        |   |   |

|          | **R: Implacable dread +11 vs. MD**---The target  |   |   |
|          | is weakened (normal save ends). During the next  |   |   |
|          | round, if the target is unengaged, it takes no   |   |   |
|          | action other than to move away from the          |   |   |
|          | messenger. If engaged, then the target's first   |   |   |
|          | action is to attempt to disengage from its foe,  |   |   |
|          | moving away if successful. If the target fails   |   |   |
|          | the disengage check, they use their second       |   |   |
|          | action to move away, inviting opportunity        |   |   |

|           | larva with 30 hit points on the battlefield where |   |   |
|           | it has detached itself from its former host. The  |   |   |
|           | staggered larva maintains the initiative of its   |   |   |
|           | host, but any conditions placed upon the host     |   |   |
|           | end. (If the save fails, the larva gets squashed  |   |   |

|           | nearby a behemoth, the koruku detaches itself     |   |   |
|           | from its host and leaps onto the behemoth. Once   |   |   |
|           | it finds a likely spot for hibernation is secrets |   |   |
|           | a slime which hardens into a cocoon. The host     |   |   |
|           | reverts back to its original stats, losing all of |   |   |
|           | the benefits it gained as a symbiont, but takes   |   |   |
|           | no damage.                                        |   |   |

If you'd like to make your dragonic wyrmspawn more deadly, give them
wings and limited flight. Or if your dragonics have the blood of the
mighty wyrms flowing through them (or the magic of dragons has worn off
on them), consider giving some of them a random dragon ability.

*Limited flight:* At the start of each turn, roll a d6. If the result is
less than or equal to the escalation die, the dragonic gains flight as a
move action during its turns thanks to a pair of wings it unfurls from
its back. The flight tends to be more power-flapping or gliding from one
place to another rather than hovering. Flamewings who also have limited
flight prefer to use their burning wings to fly in combat wherever
possible, resorting to their physical wings only if needed.

*Blood of the wyrm:* This dragonic displays traits of its forebears, the
mighty wyrms. Roll a d10 and consult the random dragon ability table, or
choose one of the first ten options that looks likely to shape the story
or battle.

|          | enemy and one random ally to be dazed until the  |   |   |

|          | damage, and the flamewing loses its ability to   | * |   |

|          | *Attack on the wing:* The flamewing can make     | * |   |
|          | attacks mid-movement as it flies past without    |   |   |
|          | taking opportunity attacks, but at a --2 attack  |   |   |
|          | penalty. It can split its *burning mace* attack  |   |   |
|          | between two enemies in two locations as it flies |   |   |
|          | past. As its wings are made of fire, the         |   |   |
|          | flamewing might accidentally set the environment |   |   |
|          | ablaze, which might benefit one side or the      |   |   |
|          | other in the battle (or harm both).              |   |   |
|          |                                                  |   |   |
|          | *Fiery temper:* When the flamewing is forced to  |   |   |
|          | land, it rolls 3d20 for its next attack roll and |   |   |
|          | takes the best result.                           |   |   |
|          |                                                  |   |   |
|          | *Flight:* The flamewing can fly, and fly         |   |   |
|          | fast---soaring on wings of flame. However, its   |   |   |
|          | turning circle isn't great and it can't hover,   |   |   |
|          | so in tight quarters it needs to land. Also, its |   |   |
|          | wings are made of fire, and overusing its        |   |   |
|          | *fireball breath* can cause the wings to gutter  |   |   |
|          | and fade.                                        |   |   |

|          | *Resist fire 16+:* When a fire attack targets    |   |   |
|          | this creature, the attacker must roll a natural  |   |   |
|          | 16+ on the attack roll or it only deals half     |   |   |
|          | damage.                                          |   |   |

|          | taking the fire damage it heals that many hit    |   |   |

|          | attack.                                          |   |   |

### Lammasu

*Flight:* All lammasu fly. Warrior lammasu fly with upright dignity,
sometimes a bit slower than is wise. Fallen lammasu fly well enough to
keep up with all but the quickest demons. Lammasu wizards and priests
fly more gracefully than the warriors, but only because they're less
eager to run into things.

*Minor servitors:* When a lammasu isn't in combat or resting in
stone-form, it's usually surrounded by a fawning retinue of spirit
servants. The servants look like people from ages the world no longer
remembers. They stick close to the lammasu, seldom or never speak, and
in truth may be a projection of the lammasu's spirit or will. The
spirits are no use in combat, but they can manipulate small objects such
as combs and scented perfumes to use upon the lammasu's beard, hair, and
jewelry.

*Stone rest:* Outside the overworld, lammasu who wish to rest can
transform themselves into solid stone. A lammasu can see and hear as if
it were still made of flesh. It can change back to flesh as a free
action, but must wait a day before returning to stone, which is no great
delay for lammasu guardians whose positions extend for decades or
centuries. Considering that many sculptors carve stone lammasu to place
in front of or within important structures, it's deliberately difficult
for a thief or assassin to know whether he is facing a stone statue or a
transformed beast.

Note that this form of solid stone is different from the living stone
form sometimes adopted by the lammasu warrior, wizard, and priest during
battle.

|          | three death saves, and the effect is             |   |   |
|          | cumulative). In addition, the crit range of      |   |   |
|          | attacks by the lich against the target expands   |   |   |
|          | by the escalation die and the lich heals 40 hit  |   |   |

|          | ghostly hands reach up from the ground and grab  | * |   |
|          | the target (as they try to pull the target's     | H |   |

|          | *Ghostly grasping hands:* When a creature is     | * |   |
|          | being grabbed by the ghostly hands, it takes 30  |   |   |
|          | negative energy damage at the start of its turn  |   |   |
|          | and must make a last gasp save. On the fourth    |   |   |
|          | failed last gasp save, the creature's soul is    |   |   |
|          | torn from it and it dies. Unconscious creatures  |   |   |
|          | take a --4 penalty to their last gasp saves.     |   |   |
|          | Note, grabbed creatures take a --5 penalty to    |   |   |

|          | *Blink and you missed it:* Once per battle when  |   |   |
|          | an attack would hit the lich prince, the attack  |   |   |
|          | misses instead and the lich teleports to a       |   |   |
|          | nearby location it can see as a free action.     |   |   |
|          |                                                  |   |   |
|          | *Heartstopper:* When the lich prince scores a    |   |   |
|          | critical hit, if after taking damage the target  |   |   |
|          | still has hit points, it drops to 0 hp, falls    |   |   |
|          | unconscious, and begins making death saves. When |   |   |
|          | the target saves against this effect, it regains |   |   |
|          | hit points equal to the amount it had before     |   |   |
|          | dropping to 0 hp (after the crit damage). In     |   |   |
|          | addition, the crit range of attacks by the lich  |   |   |
|          | against the target expands by an amount equal to |   |   |
|          | the escalation die and the lich heals 60 hit     |   |   |
|          | points.                                          |   |   |

|          | *Immortality:* When the lich drops to 0 hit      |   |   |
|          | points, it crumbles to dust but does not die. It |   |   |
|          | begins to reform near its phylactery, taking a   |   |   |
|          | number of days to regain its full strength equal |   |   |
|          | to its level. If the phylactery has been         |   |   |
|          | destroyed, the lich dies when it drops to 0 hit  |   |   |

|          | if the target has 120 hp or fewer, it's dazed    |   |   |
|          | (--4 attack) and does not add the escalation die |   |   |

|          | *Mortal terror:* The presence of a mummy         |   |   |
|          | unnerves opponents, giving it an unusual *fear   |   |   |
|          | aura*. While engaged with this creature, enemies |   |   |

### Naga

[Nastier Special for all naga:]{.underline}

Arcane balance: Whenever the naga rolls a natural 1--5 with an attack
roll, it can cancel one magical effect created by a spell or magic item
that is affecting the naga or a nearby creature (including beneficial
effect on a PC). It can be an ongoing effect, an effect that only lasts
a round, or even an effect that was supposed to last until the end of
the battle. Use your sense of what is magical and what isn't: a bard's
song is clearly magical, but a rogue's Shadow Walk talent probably
isn't, despite the wizard's arguments that it *should* be.

|          | in its black charger form and happily mounts the | D |   |
|          | beast (treat it as a teleport for simplicity's   | * |   |
|          | sake). Once they are astride, the waterhorse     | * |   |
|          | attempts to flee into the nearest body of water, |   |   |
|          | taking the rider with them. To prevent this, the | * |   |
|          | rider can attempt a DC 25 Strength-based control | * |   |
|          | check as a quick action (1d20 + level + Strength | H |   |
|          | modifier + any relevant background + escalation  | P |   |
|          | die). If they succeed, the rider gains control   | * |   |
|          | of the creature and can either dismount or steer | * |   |
|          | it to where they wish, potentially with a view   |   |   |
|          | to stealing its bridle on their next turn        |   |   |
|          | (requiring a successful attack roll with that    |   |   |
|          | specified aim). If the rider does not attempt to |   |   |
|          | steal the bridle on their next turn, they must   |   |   |
|          | make another DC 25 check to remain in control.   |   |   |
|          | Stealing the bridle turns the waterhorse into    |   |   |
|          | its humanoid form and throws the rider clear. If |   |   |
|          | the rider fails to control the creature at any   |   |   |
|          | point, it converts its next standard action to a |   |   |
|          | move action, using it and any other move actions |   |   |
|          | it may have to enter the water and trigger its   |   |   |
|          | watery grave attack 1 round later. The rider can |   |   |
|          | continue to make control checks until *watery    |   |   |
|          | grave* is activated.                             |   |   |

|          | longer make control checks and instead begin to  |   |   |
|          | make last gasp saves. If they accrue five        |   |   |
|          | failures, they drown. Their bones will make a    |   |   |
|          | nice addition to the pile, as soon as the        |   |   |
|          | waterhorse has finished gnawing on them.         |   |   |

### Nymph

[Standard powers for all nymphs]{.underline}

*Domain bound:* Nymphs are tied to an area of land or water. Land areas
will be at most a couple miles wide; water areas might be much larger.
As a rule, nymphs can't leave the area they're bound to.

*Limited immortality:* A nymph that drops to 0 hit points or is
otherwise slain will eventually return to life in its domain, so long as
its domain and its secret survives. After an hour, a nymph needs a hard
save to return to life. After eight hours, a nymph needs a normal save
to return to life. If the nymph has still not returned, roll an easy
save at the end of each 24 hours until the nymph succeeds.

*Note on types:* The following nymphs with the humanoid type probably
remember themselves. Nymphs that have probably forgotten their original
selves have the elemental type.

|          | *prismatic blast* attack during battle must      |   |   |
|          | write down one true personal trait or preference |   |   |
|          | about their character such as: "Yellow hair",    |   |   |
|          | "Afraid of spiders", "Prefers white wine to      |   |   |
|          | red", or "Tattoo of a halfling on left bicep".   |   |   |
|          | These personal traits are shuffled and randomly  |   |   |
|          | distributed equally by the GM after the battle   |   |   |
|          | is over. Whichever trait each player receives is |   |   |
|          | now true for their character as well as for the  |   |   |
|          | character of the player who wrote it down        |   |   |
|          | (unless there has somehow turned out to be a     |   |   |
|          | swap...). These traits don't alter game          |   |   |
|          | mechanics (feats, powers, backgrounds, icon      |   |   |
|          | relationships, attributes, bonuses, etc.). They  |   |   |
|          | are personal details that have been warped and   |   |   |
|          | scrambled by the prismatic ogre mage's magic.    |   |   |

### Ooze

All oozes have the following two abilities:

*Flows where it likes:* The ooze is immune to opportunity attacks.

*Ooze:* The ooze is immune to effects. When an attack applies a
condition to an ooze (dazed, hampered, weakened, ongoing damage, etc.),
that condition doesn't affect it.

|          | *Resist fire 16+:* When a fire attack targets    |   |   |

|          | 16+ on the attack roll or it only deals half     |   |   |
|          | damage.                                          |   |   |

|          | *Spectacular effects:* When the phoenix is dealt |   |   |
|          | a critical hit, it must roll an easy save (6+).  |   |   |
|          | If the save fails, the phoenix drops to 0 hit    |   |   |
|          | points; see the *reborn in fire* ability below!  |   |   |

|          | 0 hit points, roll a d20 and add the escalation  |   |   |
|          | die. For each time this phoenix has rolled its   |   |   |
|          | *reborn in fire* ability earlier this battle,    |   |   |
|          | subtract 10 from the roll. For example, a        |   |   |
|          | phoenix making its second *reborn in fire* roll  |   |   |
|          | (because its first roll ended up being 20+!)     |   |   |
|          | when the escalation die is 6 would roll the d20  |   |   |
|          | and subtract 4.                                  |   |   |

|          | **20+:** The flamebird phoenix is immediately    |   |   |
|          | reborn, healing to 40 hit points, and keeps      |   |   |
|          | fighting!                                        |   |   |

|          | **15--19:** The phoenix is reborn in fire, but   |   |   |
|          | vaults into the overworld, removed from the      |   |   |
|          | battle. On the other hand, it's not done with    |   |   |
|          | the PCs! Add the phoenix to an upcoming battle   |   |   |
|          | by surprise, adding it as an additional monster  |   |   |
|          | not accounted for by the usual                   |   |   |

|          | **8--14:** The flamebird phoenix is reborn in    |   |   |
|          | fire but wants nothing more to do with this      |   |   |
|          | battle. It makes the following attack, but when  |   |   |
|          | the attack is over it shoots off into the        |   |   |
|          | overworld so quickly that it's a teleport        |   |   |
|          | effect, and does not return to the battle, nor   |   |   |
|          | to the adventure.                                |   |   |

|          | somewhere nearby in a few hours, days, months,   |   |   |
|          | or years. Probably not relevant to the PCs       |   |   |
|          | unless they or the phoenix bear a special        |   |   |
|          | grudge.                                          |   |   |

|          | then instead of taking damage the flamebird      |   |   |
|          | phoenix heals that amount instead.               |   |   |

|          | engaged with the phoenix.                        |   |   |

|          | *Resist fire 16+:* When a fire attack targets    |   |   |
|          | this creature, the attacker must roll a natural  |   |   |
|          | 16+ on the attack roll or it only deals half     |   |   |
|          | damage.                                          |   |   |

|          | *Spectacular effects:* When the phoenix is dealt |   |   |
|          | a critical hit, it must roll an easy save (6+).  |   |   |
|          | If the save fails, the phoenix drops to 0 hit    |   |   |
|          | points; see the *reborn in fire* ability below!  |   |   |
|          |                                                  |   |   |
|          | *Reborn in fire:* Whenever the phoenix drops to  |   |   |
|          | 0 hit points, roll a d20 and add the escalation  |   |   |
|          | die. For each time this phoenix has rolled its   |   |   |
|          | *reborn in fire* ability earlier this battle,    |   |   |
|          | subtract 10 from the roll. For example, a        |   |   |
|          | phoenix making its second *reborn in fire* roll  |   |   |
|          | (because its first roll ended up being 20+!)     |   |   |
|          | when the escalation die is 6 would roll the d20  |   |   |
|          | and subtract 4.                                  |   |   |

|          | **20+:** The resurgent phoenix is immediately    |   |   |
|          | reborn, healing to 70 hit points and keeps       |   |   |
|          | fighting!                                        |   |   |

|          | **15--19:** The phoenix is reborn in fire, but   |   |   |
|          | vaults into the overworld, removed from the      |   |   |
|          | battle. On the other hand, it's not done with    |   |   |
|          | the PCs! Add the phoenix to an upcoming battle   |   |   |
|          | by surprise, adding it as an additional monster  |   |   |
|          | not accounted for by the usual                   |   |   |

|          | **8--14:** The resurgent phoenix is reborn in    |   |   |
|          | fire but wants nothing more to do with this      |   |   |
|          | battle. It makes the following attack, but when  |   |   |
|          | the attack is over it shoots off into the        |   |   |
|          | overworld so quickly that it's a teleport        |   |   |
|          | effect, and does not return to the battle, nor   |   |   |
|          | to the adventure.                                |   |   |
|          |                                                  |   |   |

|          | **7 or less:** The phoenix flares back to life   |   |   |
|          | somewhere nearby in a few hours, days, months,   |   |   |
|          | or years. Probably not relevant to the PCs       |   |   |
|          | unless they or the phoenix bear a special        |   |   |
|          | grudge.                                          |   |   |

|          | *Flaming wings:* The solar phoenix deals 20 fire | * |   |
|          | damage to each enemy that ends it turn engaged   | * |   |
|          | with the phoenix.                                |   |   |

|          | *Resist fire 16+:* When a fire attack targets    |   |   |
|          | this creature, the attacker must roll a natural  |   |   |
|          | 16+ on the attack roll or it only deals half     |   |   |
|          | damage.                                          |   |   |
|          |                                                  |   |   |
|          | *Spectacular effects:* When the solar phoenix is |   |   |
|          | dealt a critical hit, it must roll an easy save  |   |   |
|          | (6+). If the save fails, the phoenix drops to 0  |   |   |
|          | hit points; see the *reborn in fire* ability     |   |   |
|          | below!                                           |   |   |

|          | *Reborn in fire:* Whenever the phoenix drops to  |   |   |
|          | 0 hit points, roll a d20 and add the escalation  |   |   |
|          | die. For each time this phoenix has rolled its   |   |   |
|          | *reborn in fire* ability earlier this battle,    |   |   |
|          | subtract 10 from the roll. For example, a        |   |   |
|          | phoenix making its second *reborn in fire* roll  |   |   |
|          | (because its first roll ended up being 20+!)     |   |   |
|          | when the escalation die is 6 would roll the d20  |   |   |
|          | and subtract 4.                                  |   |   |
|          |                                                  |   |   |
|          | **20+:** The solar phoenix is immediately        |   |   |
|          | reborn, healing to 400 hit points and keeps      |   |   |
|          | fighting!                                        |   |   |

|          | **15--19:** The phoenix is reborn in fire, but   |   |   |
|          | vaults into the overworld, removed from the      |   |   |
|          | battle. On the other hand, it's not done with    |   |   |
|          | the PCs! Add the phoenix to an upcoming battle   |   |   |
|          | by surprise, adding it as an additional monster  |   |   |
|          | not accounted for by the usual                   |   |   |
|          | encounter-building calculations.                 |   |   |

|          | **8--14:** The solar phoenix is reborn in fire   |   |   |
|          | but wants nothing more to do with this battle.   |   |   |
|          | It makes the following attack, but when the      |   |   |
|          | attack is over it shoots off into the overworld  |   |   |
|          | so quickly that it's a teleport effect, and does |   |   |
|          | not return to the battle, nor to the adventure.  |   |   |
|          |                                                  |   |   |

|          | **7 or less:** The phoenix flares back to life   |   |   |
|          | somewhere nearby in a few hours, days, months,   |   |   |
|          | or years. Probably not relevant to the PCs       |   |   |
|          | unless they or the phoenix bear a special        |   |   |
|          | grudge. But who are we kidding? This is a solar  |   |   |
|          | phoenix. It has its own agenda, and the PCs just |   |   |
|          | got onto the agenda, one way or another.         |   |   |

### Pixie

All pixies have the *glamour* ability.

*Glamour*: Outside of combat, pixies can create complex illusions at
will. For the PC, it's usually a normal or hard skill check to sort out
what's real.

|          | *\[Special trigger\]* **Madness +8 vs.           | * |   |
|          | MD**---The target is maddened until the end of   | * |   |
|          | the pixie's next turn. The first thing the       | M |   |
|          | creature does on its turn is use a standard      | D |   |
|          | action to make a display of power that has no    | * |   |
|          | practical benefit. The GM chooses the attack,    | * |   |
|          | spell, or other power, which should be the most  |   |   |
|          | powerful one the character has, preferably a     | * |   |
|          | daily. The target expends the power in a great   | * |   |
|          | show of prowess, aimed for display rather than   | H |   |
|          | effect. Wizards cast their fireballs into the    | P |   |
|          | sky, monks demonstrate flawless form while       | * |   |
|          | shadow-boxing, and clerics bless the very stones | * |   |
|          | underfoot instead of allies.                     |   |   |
|          |                                                  |   |   |
|          | When the madness effect gets old, substitute any |   |   |
|          | of the following effects, by choice or at        |   |   |
|          | random:                                          |   |   |
|          |                                                  |   |   |
|          | *1:* You love pixies and hate those who threaten |   |   |
|          | them. The target is confused until the end of    |   |   |
|          | the pixie's next turn.                           |   |   |
|          |                                                  |   |   |
|          | *2:* Brains knocked loose. The target takes 4    |   |   |
|          | psychic damage each time it takes an action      |   |   |
|          | (save ends; yes that could be 3 times per round  |   |   |
|          | or more).                                        |   |   |
|          |                                                  |   |   |
|          | *3:* Reality bender. The target takes 5 ongoing  |   |   |
|          | psychic damage. Each time the target fails the   |   |   |
|          | save, the ongoing damage increases by 5,         |   |   |
|          | cumulative.                                      |   |   |
|          |                                                  |   |   |
|          | *4:* Massive attack on the unconscious mind. The |   |   |
|          | target chooses one: either let the onslaught     |   |   |
|          | slam its mind (take 15 psychic damage), or steel |   |   |
|          | its mind against the onslaught (stunned until    |   |   |
|          | the end of the pixie's next turn).               |   |   |
|          |                                                  |   |   |
|          | *5:* Compulsion to dance. The target takes 5     |   |   |
|          | ongoing psychic damage (no save) until it spends |   |   |
|          | a standard action to dance maniacally. Dancing   |   |   |
|          | ends all such ongoing damage, even if the target |   |   |
|          | has been hit multiple times with this effect.    |   |   |
|          |                                                  |   |   |
|          | *6:* Pacifism. The target can't attack until the |   |   |
|          | end of the pixie's next turn.                    |   |   |
|          |                                                  |   |   |
|          | *Dazzling lights:* During battle, pixies fill    |   |   |
|          | the air with the light and sound of countless    |   |   |
|          | flashy illusions. The effects are disorienting   |   |   |
|          | enough that the PCs don't get to add the         |   |   |
|          | escalation die to their attacks.                 |   |   |
|          |                                                  |   |   |
|          | *Flight:* Pixies make flying look like a lot of  |   |   |
|          | fun.                                             |   |   |
|          |                                                  |   |   |
|          | *Invisibility:* When an enemy attacks a pixie    |   |   |
|          | and misses, the pixie turns invisible until the  |   |   |
|          | start of its next turn (even if it makes         |   |   |
|          | opportunity attacks). A pixie can also turn      |   |   |
|          | invisible as a standard action, in which case    |   |   |
|          | the invisibility still lasts until the start of  |   |   |
|          | its next turn.                                   |   |   |

|           | location. But its control sucks. The teleport     | P |   |

|           | invisible and extremely difficult to even detect. |   |   |
|           | A PC who wants to locate the pixie-pod must spend |   |   |
|           | a standard action searching and succeed at a DC   |   |   |
|           | 25 skill check using Wisdom. Backgrounds          |   |   |
|           | connected to plants and the wilderness help       |   |   |
|           | normally, and general searching skills and magic  |   |   |
|           | talents might help a bit but not at full          |   |   |
|           | strength. Once located, the plant can be attacked |   |   |
|           | like a normal invisible creature. When it         |   |   |
|           | teleports, however, it must be located all over   |   |   |
|           | again.                                            |   |   |

|           | count toward the total when building a battle     |   |   |

|          | out of its mouth. Roll a hard save (16+); on a   |   |   |

|          | *Larval feeding:* The worm's stomach also        |   |   |

### Rakshasa

[Nastier Special for all rakshasas]{.underline}

*Lockheart:* The first time a rakshasa is dropped to 0 hit points, it
dies but will definitely be reborn, even if the PCs attempt to use an
icon die result to prevent the resurrection. A PC who scores a critical
hit against the rakshasa can attempt to nullify *lockheart* by choosing
to ignore all other effects of the critical hit (all damage, not just
the doubling) and attempting a normal save. If the save succeeds,
*lockheart* is ignored this battle. If the save fails, *lockheart* is
still in effect. A rakshasa can only use *lockheart* once in its
lifetime.

Alternatively, instead of rolling saves, the PCs could go on a quest to
find the lockheart's key before confronting the rakshasa! That's a story
angle you get to manipulate as you choose.

*Backwards palms:* When staggered, the rakshasa's hands shapeshift so
that its palms trade places with the backs of its hands. It not only
looks extremely weird, it also presents the player characters with an
odd choice: The next time the escalation die would advance, the PCs have
to choose whether the escalation die will decrease by 1 (minimum 0) or
whether this rakshasa gets to use the escalation die until the end of
the battle. If the PC group is split, the decision goes to the character
with the highest initiative.

### Redcap

All redcaps have special abilities based on *The Bad Word*. Before every
battle against redcaps, the GM should determine the *bad word* for that
battle. Whenever a PC or a player at the table says the word, every
redcap in the battle can use their associated ability as a free action
that interrupts whatever action is currently happening.

### Salamander

[Abilities for All Salamanders]{.underline}

*Escalating inferno:* If the salamander is in an area with flames, lava,
or that it has set on fire, it gets to use the escalation die, adding it
to its attack rolls. Even when not fighting in such an environment, a
salamander attacked with a spell or attack that deals fire damage gets
to use the escalation die until the end of its next turn, or longer if
it's a powerful or lingering spell. Avoid casting fireball in battle
with a salamander!

*Resist fire 16+:* Fire attacks against the salamander must roll a
natural 16+ attack roll or the attack does half damage. Whether or not
such an attack hits, see escalating inferno!

[Nastier Special]{.underline}

against a salamander and who roll a natural 1 or 3 take ongoing fire
damage equal to twice the salamander's level unless they drop their

|           | blow' will detect that the creature is still      |   |   |
|           | alive. Shadow mongooses like to fake their deaths |   |   |
|           | so that they can escape battle with their stolen  |   |   |
|           | icon relationships. Since shadow anatomy isn't    |   |   |
|           | entirely biological, this ability functions like  |   |   |
|           | fleeing the battle if it succeeds, the PCs can go |   |   |
|           | ahead and blast away at what they think is the    |   |   |
|           | corpse, but they'll be fragging the mongoose's    |   |   |
|           | shadows, not the mongoose itself.                 |   |   |

|           | though not mid-battle. Shadow mongoose destroyers |   |   |
|           | of fate use this ability to seem innocuous until  |   |   |

|           | to their owners. The person who killed the shadow |   |   |

|           | *Drop the loot:* The shadow mongoose flees the    |   |   |
|           | battle. One nearby enemy of the shadow mongoose   |   |   |
|           | has their icon relationships flip positive to     |   |   |
|           | negative and vise-versa (conflicted relationships |   |   |
|           | are unaffected). This relationship inversion is   |   |   |
|           | temporary, lasting only until the end of the next |   |   |

|           | is moving in this form. When it returns to its    |   |   |

|           | (6+); if it succeeds, the warder becomes the      | H |   |

|           | attack target itself instead as an interrupt      |   |   |
|           | action. If the attack roll doesn't hit against    |   |   |
|           | the warder's defenses, the attack misses.         |   |   |
|           | Otherwise, the warder takes all damage and        |   |   |
|           | effects of the spell for that ally. When the      |   |   |
|           | warder takes damage this way, it can make an      |   |   |

|          | usually will, provided some of its enemies are   |   |   |

### Specter

[Nastier Specials for all specters]{.underline}

*Aura of loss:* The first time during a battle the specter is staggered,
each nearby enemy with 30 hp or fewer is hampered until the end of the
specter's next turn. (9^th^ level dread specter affects enemies with 60
hp or fewer.)

*Healing drain:* When an enemy engaged with a specter heals, it heals
only half the normal hit points, and the specter heals the other half
(round down).

*Spectral evasion:* Once per battle as a free action when an enemy
attacks the specter, it can force the attacker to reroll the attack and
use the result the specter prefers.

[Champion Tier: Star-Masks & Cultists]{.underline}

To change things up, here are some additional nastier-special abilities
to give to the star-mask cultists and puppets the PCs face. The
abilities key off who the star-mask cultist was before they were taken
by the mask.

[Dwarf (or maybe Half-Orc)]{.underline}

*\[Group ability\] Stronger than stone:* Once per battle, a staggered
dwarf heals to full health as a free action. No matter how many dwarves
there are in the battle, only one can use this ability.

[Elf (or maybe Halfling)]{.underline}

*\[Group ability\] Elf-like grace:* Once per battle, an elf can take a
second standard action during its turn. No matter how many elves there
are in the battle, only one can use this ability.

[Human (or maybe Half Orc)]{.underline}

*\[Group ability\] Sudden cunning:* Once per battle, a human can turn
one of its missed attacks into a hit, or a hit into a critical hit. No
matter how many humans there are in the battle, only one can use this
ability.

[Halfling or Gnome (or maybe Elf)]{.underline}

*\[Group ability\] Quicker than that:* Once per battle, a halfling or
gnome can turn a hit against it into a miss, or can ignore the miss
effects of an attack against it. No matter how many halflings or gnomes
there are in the battle, only one can use this ability.

[Epic Tier: Star-Mask Brains]{.underline}

The epic tier star-mask creatures are all star-mask brains. Star mask
brains warp the reality around them, creating odd effects that can
surprise the unwary

[Star-Mask Brain Effects]{.underline}

At the start of each round in a battle with one or more star-mask
brains, roll a d10 to see what happens. Some effects are immediate,
others last the entire round:

**1. Consumption.** One brain can consume any lower-level xombie,
star-mask, or brain ally to heal back to half hit points if it's
staggered, or to full health if not staggered. If there are no allies
present, 1d4 xombies or cultists show up (note, they may be too low
level to have any effect except to be swiftly eliminated by the PCs or
consumed in a later round).

**2. De-escalating illusion.** The star-mask brain blasts the minds of
the adventurers with illusions---the escalation die decreases by 1 (to a
minimum of 0).

**3. Delusions.** The star-mask brain messes with the adventurers'
perceptions. Once this round as a free action, the brain can roll a save
to avoid a ranged attack that hits it. If it succeeds, the attack misses
instead. If it rolls 16+ on the save, the attack is redirected and
automatically hits a nearby enemy other than the attacker of the brain's
choice.

**4. Mental empowerment.** Each star-mask brain or cultist in the battle
gains a +2 bonus to saves and MD this round.

**5. Intrusive thoughts.** The star-mask brain is thinking hard about
the characters---each PC takes 2d12 psychic damage.

**6. Magical flux.** When the PCs use spell attacks or other magic
attacks, they must roll twice and use the lower result.

**7. Magical reflux.** When a PC casts a spell this round, they take
2d20 force damage.

**8. Matter warp.** Everything shudders and twists for a moment, and
each engaged creature pops free from engagement.

**9. Possession.** The hive mind possesses a PC, who is automatically
confused until the end of their next turn. Each adventurer can be
confused only once per battle from this effect.

**10. Steal the momentum.** The star-mask hive mind temporarily steals
the escalation die; this round, so the monsters get the benefit of the
die and the adventurers don't.

|          | or fewer can't target the omnipotent brain with  |   |   |

|          | *Telekinetic grasp:* As a move action the brain  |   |   |
|          | can move an ally or enemy, causing them to fly   |   |   |
|          | about. An enemy can roll a save to avoid being   |   |   |
|          | moved against its will. If it succeeds, there's  |   |   |
|          | no effect. Enemies hurled against solid objects  |   |   |
|          | or other allies take 2d20 damage, or possibly    |   |   |
|          | more if hurled into dangerous terrain.           |   |   |

|          | *Absorb:* When an enemy engaged with the         |   |   |
|          | star-mask brain omnipotent rolls a natural 1--5  |   |   |
|          | on a disengage check, it's absorbed into the     |   |   |
|          | omnipotent brain's flesh. Absorbed characters    |   |   |
|          | are stuck, weakened, and move with the           |   |   |
|          | omnipotent (hard save ends all, 16+). Creatures  |   |   |
|          | can also be freed from an omnipotent brain's     |   |   |
|          | flesh with a DC 30 skill check as a standard     |   |   |
|          | action. If the check fails by 5 or more, the     |   |   |
|          | assisting ally is also now absorbed with the     |   |   |
|          | same effects.                                    |   |   |

|          | omnipotent brain with a ranged attack and rolls  |   |   |
|          | a natural 1--5, it must reroll the attack        |   |   |
|          | against an ally engaged with the brain, if any,  |   |   |
|          | as if it had fumbled.                            |   |   |

|          | *Psychic command:* The omnipotent brain can use  |   |   |
|          | a standard action to allow a nearby ally to make |   |   |
|          | an attack as a free action with a +4 attack      |   |   |
|          | bonus. If the ally misses it takes 1d8 damage    |   |   |

#### Star-Mask Host Template

Star-mask cultists can range from those who are simple followers who are
unaware of the cult's true purpose, to fully controlled puppets, to
individuals who welcome their star-mask "partners."

A star-mask brute normally begins life as a large beast or a dragon, but
becomes host to dozens of star-masks. The star-masks warp and mutate
their host, and eventually it is no longer recognizable.

To convert a regular monster or NPC to a star-mask host, give it a
couple abilities from those listed under psychic powers, physical
warping, and tentacles. In addition, increase its attack bonus by +4.
The base creature's level increases by 1 for purposes of building
battles.

[Psychic Powers]{.underline}

The star-mask hosts have psychic powers granted to them by their
symbiotic masks. Such hosts usually have some outward sign of their
powers---swollen skulls or throbbing veins.

[Choose one or more of the following:]{.underline}

**C: Dysthymic ray +5 + level vs. MD (one nearby enemy)**---10 psychic
damage (champion: 20 damage; epic: 30 damage)

*Natural 18+:* The target is confused (save ends) and any confusion
effect from the ray on a previous target ends.

*Quick use:* 1/round, as a quick action.

*Group mind:* Provided there is a star-mask brain around (it doesn't
have to be in the fight, just in the general vicinity), the host gains a
+4 bonus to MD and knows everything that the star-mask brain knows (and
vise-versa). If there isn't a star-mask brain in the area, the host only
gains a +1 bonus to MD.

*Healed by the hive mind:* Once per battle as a standard action, the
host heals 25% of its maximum hit points, as does one of its nearby
allies.

*Hive mind puppet:* When an enemy drops to 0 hp or below, it must roll a
save. If it fails, it's "turned" to the star-masks' side. A turned
creature recovers during its next turn with temporary hp equal to its
normal maximum hit points, but it's now an ally of the star-masks (hard
save ends, 16+). Once that creature saves and breaks free, it must roll
a normal save. If it fails, it loses the temporary hit points.

**R: Psychic chains +5 + level vs. MD**---5 ongoing psychic damage
(champion: 10 ongoing damage, epic: 20 ongoing damage)

*Aftereffect:* When the target saves against the ongoing damage, if the
save was a natural odd roll, the target becomes confused until it hits
an ally with an attack.

*Limited use:* 1/battle.

*Psychic illusion:* The host looks normal. It requires a DC 30 skill
check to notice things like tentacles or bulging muscles on it. If a
creature's MD is 17 or less, it won't even notice the mask itself.

*Telekinetic flight:* The host can fly. When an enemy misses the host
with an attack and rolls a natural 1--5, it pops free from that enemy.

**C: Woe betide you +5 + level vs. MD (one nearby enemy)**---10 psychic
damage (champion: 20 damage; epic: 35 damage), and the target can't heal
using a recovery (save ends)

*Limited use:* 1/battle.

[Physical Enhancements]{.underline}

The star-mask host has been physically enhanced by the star-mask.
Hunched and twisted forms or skin split open over bulging red muscles
are common side effects. The greater the physical enhancements the more
brutish and less intelligent the host becomes (and the easier for the
star-mask to influence).

[Choose one or more of the following:]{.underline}

*Amazing endurance:* The host gains +2 AC and +1 PD, or double that
bonus while it is defending a star-mask brain.

*Leap:* Once per battle when the escalation die is even, the host can
pop free from all enemies and leap somewhere nearby or far away as a
move action. If the host engages an enemy with this movement and
attacks, it gains a +1 bonus to that attack.

*Trampling charge:* As a standard action, the host moves through an
enemy's space without taking an opportunity attack and finishes its move
out of engagement, making the following attack against that enemy.

**Trample +5 + level vs. AC**---10 damage (champion: 20 damage; epic: 40
damage)

*Natural even miss:* Half damage.

*Natural even hit:* The target pops free from the host and is hurled far
away from the host.

[Tentacles]{.underline}

The star-mask grips to its host with tentacles, but this star-mask has
gone further than that.

[Choose one or more of the following:]{.underline}

*Barbed tentacles:* Enemies that pop free of the host or move away from
it without first disengaging take 10 damage.

*Climbing tentacles:* The host can climb up walls and across ceilings as
easily as it moves on the ground.

*Grasping tentacles:* Enemies engaged with the host must roll twice for
disengage checks and take the lowest result.

*Tentacles everywhere:* If the star-mask host is intercepted, it can
make a *probing tentacles* attack as a free action.

**C: Probing tentacles +5 + level vs. PD (an enemy intercepting
it)**---The enemy becomes stuck and takes 5 ongoing poison damage (save
ends both) (champion: 10 ongoing damage; epic: 20 ongoing damage)

*Target dies while still stuck:* If a creature dies while stuck in the
tentacles, the host lays 1d4 star-mask eggs in it, which hatch into
scuttling star-masks after 1d3 -- 1 rounds (0 rounds mean the eggs hatch
almost instantly).

**R: Whipping tentacles +5 + level vs. AC**---10 damage (champion: 20
damage; epic: 35 damage)

*Quick use:* 1/round, as a quick action.

### Taranar

[Special Abilities for All Taranar]{.underline}

*All-rock (resist weapons and negative energy 16+):* All taranar are
resistant to physical damage as a result of their stony nature. If an
assailant fails to make a natural roll of 16+ when using a weapon
against a taranar, the attacker deals only half damage. The resistance
also applies to negative energy damage, which tends to fizzle
ineffectively against the ancient stones.

*Lightning-flare:* As a last ditch defense, when a taranar is reduced to
between 1 and 10 hp, it can discharge its remaining stored energy as a
counterattack (no attack roll required) against the character who
delivered the telling blow, dealing 1d6 lightning damage per level of
the taranar. The taranar immediately returns to its immobile rock form
and cannot take any further role in the battle. It will then remain
torpid unless destroyed or the cycle turns full circle and the
conditions for it to wake are met again (providing they can be). Such
severely damaged creatures reawaken as broken taranar, regardless of
what they were before.

*Thick-skinned:* Being made of stone has its benefits. The taranar are
immune to almost all effects---they cannot be dazed, weakened, confused,
or made vulnerable to anything beyond those energies they are already
vulnerable to (fire and cold; see below). Taranar are also immune to
ongoing damage.

[Cracking Up]{.underline}

Taranar are big and tough. But even big, tough creatures have a weakness
(or, at least, you really have to hope they do if you don't want to get
squashed). For the stone people, their two main fears are fire and ice.
This may stem from their clashes with their ancient foes the frost and
fire giants, or it may be due to the actions of those who, over the
centuries, have used heat and cold to smash their bodies into manageable
fragments.

As a result, the taranar are vulnerable to fire and cold energy, both of
which play havoc with their physiology---so much so that a hit from a
fire attack followed immediately (either in the current or subsequent
round) by a hit from a cold attack will cause double cold damage,
irrespective of whether a critical (normally 18+) has been rolled. If a
critical is rolled, triple the damage inflicted.

[Iconic Powers]{.underline}

Centuries of existence as free-standing monoliths have exposed the
taranar to many of the world's most powerful magical traditions. There's
something about a circle or avenue of standing stones that inspires
druids, cultists, chaos magicians, and wizards to get a ritual going.

Part of the taranar's remarkable success at hiding through the ages
comes from the fact that they don't wake up just because someone is
using their stone as an altar for a goblin sacrifice or a ritual of
rebirth. But sleeping through centuries of ritual magic doesn't mean
that the taranar have been unaffected by the experience. It's possible
that a taranar could have acquired lingering magical abilities.

You can use the following special abilities in at least five ways:

1: As a consequence of a story connection between a taranar and its
location in the world, obviously exposed for a long period of time to
magicians associated with an icon.

2: As a reaction to a PC's use of an icon advantage, particularly as a
possible complication of an icon advantage used when the taranar are in
play or in the story.

3: To cast the taranar as heroes or villains relative to the player
characters' intentions.

4: As lower impact nastier specials in battles that seem overly easy on
the PCs.

5: In combination with each other, since it's entirely possible that the
magic of more than one icon has shaped a stone!

**Magic Icon (The Flying Stones):** In sympathy with the magic that
keeps the Magic Icon city aloft, a taranar influenced by the Magic
Icon's magic can fly until the end of a battle after it has either
scored or suffered a critical hit. The flight isn't quick or agile. More
like empowered levitation, about what you'd expect from an airborne
monolith.

**Demonic Icon (The Stones are Red):** Roll a random demon ability. The
taranar will use that ability once this battle, and once only.

**Graceful Icon (Repose):** Roll a normal save when dropped to 0 hit
points. If the save succeeds, the taranar only drops to 1 hit point and
teleports somewhere far away to sleep for a while. And then it wakes up.
And remembers everything...

**Nature Icon (The Call):** The first time the escalation die reaches
5+, another taranar surfaces in the battle, called up from hidden
slumber.

**Undead Icon (Simple Fear):** The taranar has the *fear* ability,
affecting creatures at or beneath the fear threshold for its level
indicated on the DIY monster tables.

**Brute Icon (Savagery):** −2 to all defenses. +2 to all attacks.

**Draconic Icon (Fight the Claw):** Taranar are usually enemies of the
dragons. Exposure to their magic has taught the taranar to use the
escalation die whenever it is odd.

|          | The tarrasque can make one close attack and one  | * | 25 |
| Wrecker  | melee attack each round as a standard action.    | * |    |
|          | Note that flying is usually no defense against   |   | 21 |
| Beast    | the tarrasque, which is huge and powerful enough | * | 30 |
|          | to pluck or whack enemies out of the sky with    | * |    |

|          | *Natural even hit:* The tarrasque grabs the      | * |    |
|          | target. It will swallow a grabbed enemy in 1d3   | * |    |
|          | rounds (see *swallow whole*).                    | M |    |

|          | *Natural 16+:* The tarrasque swallows the target | * |    |
|          | immediately (see *swallow whole*).               | * |    |
|          |                                                  |   |    |

|          | *Natural 16+:* The target takes 9d6 extra damage | P |    |

|          | *Natural 16+:* The target is stunned (save       |   |    |

|          | **C: Cataclysmic tail slam +18 vs. PD (each      |   |    |
|          | nearby enemy in a group)**---170 damage          |   |    |
|          |                                                  |   |    |
|          | *Natural 16+:* The target is vulnerable (save    |   |    |
|          | ends).                                           |   |    |
|          |                                                  |   |    |
|          | *Miss:* The target is dazed until the end of its |   |    |
|          | next turn.                                       |   |    |
|          |                                                  |   |    |
|          | *Amphibious:* The tarrasque can swim and breathe |   |    |
|          | underwater (or it holds so much air in its vast  |   |    |
|          | lungs that it makes no difference).              |   |    |
|          |                                                  |   |    |
|          | *Enormously bulky:* The tarrasque is so huge     |   |    |
|          | that it ignores opportunity attacks. In          |   |    |
|          | addition, normal-sized enemies are like fleas to |   |    |
|          | it, and disengaging from the tarrasque requires  |   |    |
|          | only an easy save (6+), unless the target is     |   |    |
|          | grabbed.                                         |   |    |
|          |                                                  |   |    |
|          | *Immortal:* The tarrasque can't be killed, save  |   |    |
|          | by the explicit will of a god (and not some      |   |    |
|          | jumped-up local god, either) or, perhaps, the    |   |    |
|          | sacrifice of a great icon. The tarrasque's HP    |   |    |
|          | total indicates the amount of damage required to |   |    |
|          | make it disgorge swallowed enemies and flee to   |   |    |
|          | go hibernate while it regenerates the damage it  |   |    |
|          | suffered and decide if it wants to rampage       |   |    |
|          | again.                                           |   |    |
|          |                                                  |   |    |
|          | *Inflexible:* The tarrasque can't easily fight   |   |    |
|          | foes that get onto its back, and may not even    |   |    |
|          | notice them if they aren't attacking it. When it |   |    |
|          | does tire of a passenger, it can either use its  |   |    |
|          | *tail slam* attack (--2 attack penalty: on a     |   |    |
|          | hit, the target only takes half damage and is    |   |    |
|          | knocked off the tarrasque \[possibly falling     |   |    |
|          | damage\]; on a miss, the target takes no damage) |   |    |
|          | or a *drag* attack as a standard action,         |   |    |
|          | crushing the rider between its shell and a       |   |    |
|          | mountainside or other high, hard obstacle.       |   |    |
|          |                                                  |   |    |
|          | **Drag +21 vs. PD (each creature on its          |   |    |
|          | back)**---130 damage, the target pops free of    |   |    |
|          | the tarrasque, and the target is hampered (save  |   |    |
|          | ends)                                            |   |    |
|          |                                                  |   |    |
|          | *Legendary resistance:* The tarrasque is immune  |   |    |
|          | to normal conditions and effects (stunned,       |   |    |
|          | weakened, etc.), but it isn't completely         |   |    |
|          | impervious. Bypassing its resistances requires   |   |    |
|          | icon-supported effort. A PC can use one 5 or 6   |   |    |
|          | they acquired from icon relationship dice rolls  |   |    |
|          | to overcome the resistance each time they use an |   |    |
|          | attack or power that would apply a condition or  |   |    |
|          | effect upon the tarrasque. Of course, they must  |   |    |
|          | also provide a story to go along with the reason |   |    |
|          | the tarrasque is affected.                       |   |    |
|          |                                                  |   |    |
|          | *Leveler:* When the escalation die is even, as a |   |    |
|          | move action the tarrasque can demolish any       |   |    |
|          | ordinary structure it can reach, such as a       |   |    |
|          | house, castle wall, temple, or ship. The beast   |   |    |
|          | automatically reduces the structure to rubble,   |   |    |
|          | rendering it useless. Each creature on top of or |   |    |
|          | within the structure is subject to a *collapse*  |   |    |
|          | attack.                                          |   |    |
|          |                                                  |   |    |
|          | **Collapse +18 vs. PD (each creature in/on the   |   |    |
|          | structure)**---90 damage, and the target is      |   |    |
|          | stuck and takes 20 ongoing damage (hard save     |   |    |
|          | ends both, 16+)                                  |   |    |
|          |                                                  |   |    |
|          | *Swallow whole:* Once a creature is swallowed,   |   |    |
|          | it goes inside one of the tarrasque's gigantic   |   |    |
|          | stomachs. It can still act while inside the      |   |    |
|          | tarrasque, but it will have to deal with the     |   |    |
|          | beast's stomach acid that is splashing around. A |   |    |
|          | swallowed creature must deal 400 damage to the   |   |    |
|          | tarrasque to force it to disgorge the contents   |   |    |
|          | of its gullet, freeing the creature. During the  |   |    |
|          | tarrasque's turn, it can make a *gullet          |   |    |
|          | digestion* attack against the target as a free   |   |    |
|          | action.                                          |   |    |
|          |                                                  |   |    |
|          | **Gullet digestion +19 vs. PD**---80 acid        |   |    |
|          | damage, and 20 ongoing acid damage               |   |    |
|          |                                                  |   |    |
|          | *Miss:* 5d12 acid damage.                        |   |    |
|          |                                                  |   |    |
|          | *Soft-ish innerbelly:* The tarrasque doesn't     |   |    |
|          | have scales on the inside. It takes a --5        |   |    |
|          | penalty to all defenses against attacks from     |   |    |
|          | inside its gullet, though only melee and close   |   |    |
|          | attacks can be made in there. The tarrasque's    |   |    |
|          | insides are immune to acid damage, however.      |   |    |
|          |                                                  |   |    |
|          | [Nastier Specials]{.underline}                   |   |    |
|          |                                                  |   |    |
|          | *Fear:* While engaged with the tarrasque,        |   |    |
|          | enemies that have 216 hp or fewer are dazed (--4 |   |    |
|          | attack) and do not add the escalation die to     |   |    |
|          | their attacks.                                   |   |    |
|          |                                                  |   |    |
|          | *Regeneration 230:* While a tarrasque is         |   |    |
|          | damaged, its malign magical flesh heals 230 hit  |   |    |
|          | points at the start of the tarrasque's turn. It  |   |    |
|          | can regenerate five times per battle. If it      |   |    |
|          | heals up to its maximum hit points, then that    |   |    |
|          | use of *regeneration* doesn't count against the  |   |    |
|          | five-use limit. With this power, the monstrosity |   |    |
|          | is likely unstoppable without a powerful magical |   |    |
|          | artifact designed specifically to bind, wound,   |   |    |
|          | or otherwise hamper the tarrasque.               |   |    |

### Treant

All treants except awakened tress have the *demolish* ability.

*Free-form ability---Demolish:* Given time, treants are capable of
pulling apart just about anything that's been put together. Their roots
squeeze into spaces between paving stones, slowly pulling them up and
out of place. Their branches can likewise worm their way into spaces in
walls, doors, and gates, and with steady pressure they can pull down
most human-made structures. This slow-motion destruction takes minutes
for the simplest efforts and hours for major demolition.

### Troglodyte

[For all troglodytes]{.underline}

*Trog stench:* Trogs spray scents that stink so badly that other
humanoids take penalties to all attacks, defenses, and saves when
engaged with a troglodyte or when nearby three or more troglodytes.
Non-humanoids aren't affected.

Humanoids affected by *trog stench* can make a normal save (with a
penalty) at the end of each of their turns. If the save succeeds, the
humanoid can ignore all *trog stench* for the rest of the battle.

*Trog stench* penalties vary for different humanoid races:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  Elves, gnolls, gnomes                                   -4

  Humans, halflings, half-elves, holy ones, tieflings,    -3
  etc.

### Warbanner

Warbanners have a number of abilities in common. The feral warbanner has
the full version of these abilities. You may customize the feral
warbanner by giving it icon-associated abilities.

A warbanner generally commands large groups of mooks that are simple to
play. Creatures in a warbanner's band are allies fully under its
control. It could also have allies not in its band.

|           | lower-level ally in its band and designate that   |   |   |
|           | ally as its bearer. Alternately, it can release   |   |   |

|           | enemies that engage the bearer. The bearer is     |   |   |

|           | in the warbanner's band dropped to 0 hp since the |   |   |
|           | start of the current round, an enemy attacking    |   |   |
|           | the warbanner must roll a natural 16+ on the      |   |   |
|           | attack roll or it only takes half damage. This    |   |   |
|           | ability has no effect if the warbanner has no     |   |   |

|           | *Flight:* Warbanners fly quickly, fluttering in   |   |   |
|           | winds only they can feel, preferably never        |   |   |
|           | touching the ground. They can't fly off the       |   |   |
|           | ground higher than a flag on a pole can be        |   |   |
|           | carried into battle, so enemies on the ground can |   |   |
|           | still target them. At best, a warbanner might     |   |   |
|           | gain a +2 bonus to defenses against attacks made  |   |   |

### Werebeasts

Each werebeast can take one of three forms as a quick action once per
round: a humanoid form, a beast form, or a hybrid form that combines the
two. The hybrid form is the most powerful in combat, but the humanoid
and beast forms are useful for various activities outside of combat as
well.

The stats below work for the beast and hybrid forms. If a werebeast ends
up fighting in humanoid form, subtract 2 from all its defenses and halve
its normal attack damage.

The following powers are common for werebeasts.

*Beast heart (all three forms):* Animals of the werebeast's type are
intuitively on good terms with the were, even dire animals. If the
werebeast betrays them, however, retaliation is certain and merciless.

*Cursed bite (hybrid or animal form only):* While the moon is full, the
first time each battle a creature takes damage from a werebeast melee
attack, it takes 10 extra damage (champion: 20 damage; epic: 40 damage).
The malignant curse, transmitted through the attack, shocks the mortal
flesh. Further attacks, even from weres of different types, don't cause
extra damage. Unless blessed, purged, or otherwise cured, the damaged
creature will turn into a werebeast on the night of the next full moon.
Heroes powerful enough to fight werebeasts can usually find benefactors
or rituals to cure them, but there's an exception to every rule. GM, if
you're unsure whether it's a full moon, roll a d10. On a 1--3, the moon
is full enough.

*Resilient shifting (all three forms):* As mentioned above, a werebeast
can shift forms once per round as a quick action. When a werebeast
shifts, it can roll a save against one save ends effect.

[Nastier Specials for all werebeasts]{.underline}

The following ability is extremely nasty when combined with the *bestial
fury* most werebeasts have. It's possibly better used as a story option,
a consequence of a problem with a skill check or an icon relationship,
or a situation that should have been avoided and may require sacrifices
to deal with:

*Moon fury (hybrid form only):* While fighting in moonlight, a werebeast
gains a bonus to damage equal to its level (champion: double its level;
epic: triple it).

All xorn have the following abilities:

*Rock swimming:* As a move action the xorn can swim through the ground,
or through a wall.

*360 degree vision:* The xorn can't be surprised, and rogues can't use
their Sneak Attack class feature on them.

*Penetrating vision:* The xorn can see through all types of rock and
soil for some distance, let's say "nearby".

*Resist cold and fire 16+:* Xorn are used to the fires of the deep and
the cold of solid rock---when a cold or fire attack targets a xorn, the
attacker must roll a natural 16+ on the attack roll or it only deals
half damage.

## Monster Creation

### Initiative

Establish a monster's initiative bonus by adding its level to a modifier
between --1 and +9.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Modifier    Speed                             Example
  ----------- --------------------------------- --------------------------
  --1         Super-slow and utterly clumsy     oozes, zombies

  +0          Slow and clumsy                   animated statues

  +1          Awkward or small                  city guards, dire rats

  +2          Average                           hellhound, human thug

  +3          Just above average                derro sage

  +4          Quick                             owlbear

  +5          Fast                              wyvern

  +6          Really fast                       gnoll ranger

  +7          Fast like a fast PC               ogre mage

  +8          Blindingly fast                   rakshasa

  +9          Competing with the rogue          
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Attack Bonus

Add or subtract 1 to adjust how accurate a monster is.

### Strike Damage

Orient yourself around the average damage for a monster's attack at any
given level. When it comes to large (or double-strength) or huge (or
triple-strength) monsters, you don't have to put all their damage into
one strike. Split damage up into smaller attacks or use conditional
follow-up attacks.

### HP & AC

Use the defense numbers as the top-end rather than the baseline unless
you want the difficulty to scale up.

### Better Defense/Lesser Defense

Make either PD or MD better than the other, in general.

### Fear Threshold

If the monster has a fear ability, it's the number of hit points where
creatures are dazed (--4 attack) while engaged with the monster and
can't use the escalation die. It's based on level, so that higher-level
monsters are more fearsome.

### Stat Adjustments

Ad hoc adjustments work fine when limited to adjustments of 1 or 2
points. If you raise a couple scores, drop a couple others.

-   Scrapper: Sharp but thin: attacks +1 to +3, hp --10% to --30%

-   Offensive: Soft but strong: defenses --1 to --3, attacks +1 to +3

-   Oaf: Tough but clumsy: AC +1 to +3, attacks --1 to --3

-   Defensive: Tough but weak: AC +1 to +3, hp --10% to --30%

-   Lunk: Big and squishy: hp +15% to +40%, defenses --1 to --3

-   Brittle: Tough but thin: +1 to +3 AC, hp --10% to --30%

If you want to add a full level to a monster...

-   ...and you only want to boost its attack: Give the monster a +6
    attack boost.

-   ...and you only want to boost AC: Give the monster a +6 AC boost.

-   ...and you only want to increase the monster's hit points: Double
    the monster's hit points.

-   ...and you only want to increase the damage the monster deals: Add a
    second attack or ongoing damage.

-   ...and you only want to increase every stat: Add +1 to attack, +1 to
    all defenses, multiply its damage output by 1.25, and multiply its
    hit points by 1.25.

### Powers to Avoid

Avoid defensive powers that make it harder for the monsters to be killed
unless there's an offense to unlock the defense.

## Underkrakens

While not monsters in and of themselves, underkrakens are enormous,
city-sized dungeons in which monsters (like soul flensers) abide. They
may be alive, or they may be complex vehicles, or colonies from another
dimension or unknown portion of the world.

# Magic Items

There are two types of magic item. True magic items are permanent magic
items used as loot during adventures and rewards for success. One-use
items (mainly potions, oils, and runes) are magical treasure on which to
spend hard-won gold. (See Loot: Treasure Rewards for notes on the wealth
successful characters earn each adventure.)

## One-Use Items

The common types of one-use items include potions, oils, and runes.

### Potions

You can buy potions that fall in the tier of the environment you're in.
You can carry as many potions as you wish. Drinking a potion takes a
standard action, even if you don't have it in hand already. Feeding a
potion to an unconscious ally is also a standard action.

You can only be under the effect of a single potion at a time. If you're
using a potion that has a lingering effect, drinking another potion ends
the first effect. Non-healing potions tend to have effects that last
until the end of a battle, or around five minutes if you're prepping for
a battle and drinking potions beforehand.

#### Healing Potions

A healing potion lets the creature drinking it heal using one of their
recoveries. Potions provide bonus healing on top of what you'd generally
get with a recovery, but there's a hit point cap for the maximum healing
you can get from a potion, no matter how well you roll your recovery.

#### Healing Potion Costs

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Tier               Cost         Effect                      HP Cap
  ------------------ ------------ --------------------------- -------------
  Adventurer         50 gp        Recovery +1d8 hp            30

  Champion           100 gp       Recovery +2d8 hp            60

  Epic               200 gp       Recovery +3d8 hp            100

  Iconic             300 gp       Recovery +4d8 hp            130
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Potion of \[Energy\] Resistance

When you drink one of these potions, you gain resistance to a single
specified energy type dealt by creatures or hazards of a specific tier
for the rest of the battle or for five minutes. Resistance from a potion
is always 16+. Attackers of the tier covered, or lower, must roll a
natural 16 or higher on their attack roll to overcome your resistance
and do full damage of a type you're resistant to, otherwise they deal
half damage. Damage from a source that's a higher tier than your potion
ignores your resistance. See Resistance. For the types of resistance
available, see Other Damage Types.

#### Resistance Potion Costs

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Tier                       Resistance                 Cost
  -------------------------- -------------------------- -----------------
  Adventurer                 Resist 16+                 100 gp

  Champion                   Resist 16+                 200 gp

  Epic                       Resist 16+                 400 gp
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Oils

While potions affect creatures, magic oils affect items. Oils provide
temporary magical enhancement to weapons, armor, and spellcasters'
implements.

It's a quick action to pour magic oil on your weapon, implement, or
armor. The effect lasts until the end of a battle or for five minutes
before fading.

Each oil confers a bonus of +1 (adventurer), +2 (champion), or +3
(epic). Used on a weapon or a spellcasting implement, the bonus applies
to attack and damage rolls. Used on armor, the bonus applies to AC.

Bonuses from oils don't stack with magic items' inherent bonuses. Use
the higher bonus.

#### Oil Costs

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Tier                            Bonus               Cost

  Adventurer                      +1 Oil              100 gp

  Champion                        +2 Oil              200 gp

  Epic                            +3 Oil              400 gp
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Runes

Runes function exactly like magical oils, but in addition to the
expected +1/+2/+3 bonus, each rune also provides an additional random
enhancement to the item it is applied to. Roll for the effect when the
rune is applied to the item. An item can only have one rune applied to
it at a time.

#### Rune Costs

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Tier                          Bonus                  Cost

  Champion                      +2 Rune                300 gp

  Epic                          +3 Rune                600 gp

  61--80    +1 additional attack bonus if spell has more than one target

  81--100   Reroll one missed attack roll with implement
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

## True Magic Items

Magic items are permanently enchanted objects. You can find them during
an adventure or receive them as gifts and rewards from NPCs, but you'll
seldom find anyone willing to sell one.

### Magic Item Personalities & Quirks

Every magic item in is alive, in a sense, and possesses a personality
you have to interact with when you start using the item, establishing
and maintaining a rapport with it. What that rapport means varies from
item to item and is usually controlled by the GM. Some items talk with
their user. Others communicate in bursts of emotion or slight motion.

Each item has a personality that is largely defined by its quirk. What
you can count on as a default is that nearly all magic items want to be
used and used well.

As an adventuring hero, you can handle a number of true magic items
equal to your level. Items one tier above you count as two items, and
epic items count as three items if you are an adventurer tier character.

If you are carrying and wielding a number of items that is equal to or
lower than your current level, the magic item personality quirks will
tug at you, giving you sudden urges and desires that will feel natural
to give in to. But you'll be in charge.

If you are carrying and wielding a number of items that is greater than
your current level, the magic item personality quirks are going to have
more power over you. You're no longer running the show; instead, the
magic items are, to some extent, running you. Herein lies a roleplaying
challenge for the player and the GM.

## Chakras

You can only have one of each type of magic item (or one pair, for boots
and gloves). Rings are one for each hand. You can have as many wondrous
items as your overall capacity for magic items allows.

+-------------------------+--------------------------------------------+

### One Size Fits

Magic items shape themselves to suit the person who has given them their
chakra.

## Magic Item Basics

Some magic items are available at any level, with greater bonuses or
other effects for champion- and epic-tier versions. Others can be found
only at champion or epic levels.

### Default Bonuses

Default Bonuses are on unless they specify otherwise. Magic necklaces
have the only default bonus that is defined as provisional, a save bonus
that kicks in when your hit points are low.

### Magic Item Powers

Unless otherwise specified, magic item powers with a recharge chance
have to be activated and require a free action to use. They will also
have a trigger condition that you must meet to use the item.

Magic item powers that do not specify a recharge chance or a specific
usage pattern have powers that are always available.

The majority of magic item powers list a recharge number (6+, 11+, or
16+). You can count on using a recharge power once a day, but subsequent
uses depend on successful recharge rolls. After the battle in which
you've used an item's power, roll a d20. If your roll equals or exceeds
the recharge number for that item, you can use that item power again
that day. If the roll fails, the item power is expended until you take a
full heal-up.

### Useful Magic Items by Class

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Class         Magic Items of Particular Use
  ------------- -----------------------------------------------------------
  Barbarian     two-handed weapon, light armor

  Bard          light weapon, light armor, wand/staff

  Chaos Mage    wand/staff, shirt (armor)

  Cleric        symbol/staff, heavy armor, simple one-handed weapon, shield

  Wizard        wand/staff, shirt (armor)
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Artifacts

Artifacts are a special type of unique magic item that have their own
story. They're capable of providing multiple powers and benefits to
their bearer, although that power comes at a cost.

Each artifact functions like a normal true magic item of its type,
possessing the same default bonus, if any, and occupying one of its
bearer's chakras, if that's how that type functions.

Unlike other true magic items, artifacts have more than one power, each
with its associated quirk. When you first attune an artifact, choose one
of its powers from your tier or lower. Each time you gain a level after
that, you can choose to learn another of the artifact's powers from your
tier or lower.

The artifact's default bonus depends on the highest tier power you have
chosen from the artifact. If you have an artifact magic weapon but have
only attuned one of its adventurer-tier powers, it functions as an
adventurer-tier weapon, granting only a +1 bonus to attack and damage.
Attune one of its champion-tier powers and the weapon will blossom into
its champion-tier potential, granting a +2 bonus to attack and damage.

On the other hand, you don't have to attune all of an artifact's powers
and you don't have to take them in order.

Only one artifact may be carried at a time. In addition, each power you
choose from an artifact counts as an additional magic item for the
number of true magic items you are allowed to use before your item's
quirks overpower you.

Since acquiring an artifact is a major campaign event and such a big
deal, even the icons will take notice. Each artifact should have a
section on icon relationships that the artifact more or less requires.
If you attune an artifact and don't have the required relationships, you
will soon, as fate and destiny reshape around you! Otherwise the
artifact will eventually disappear on you, finding a bearer more to its
taste.

## Magic Item Descriptions

Each name/characteristic includes its action type, usage, description,
power, and quirk (as applying to the item's user), if applicable. Magic
items in the adventurer tier can be used by players in any tier. Magic
items in the champion tier cannot be used by players in the adventurer
tier. Epic level magic items are limited to epic-tier players.

### Arrow, Crossbow Bolt, Slingstone

In general, ammunition is one-use, hit or miss. It also doesn't take up
a chakra, and, like other one-use items, ammunition doesn't confer
quirks on its user.

#### Default Bonus

Expands crit range by 1 (adventurer, champion, and epic tier, always a
1-point expansion rather than 1 point per tier). Ammunition takes the
bonus of the weapon that shoots it, just like mundane ammunition does.

#### Adventurer

##### Energy

This ammunition has been enchanted with one of the following types of
energy: acid, cold, fire, holy, lightning, thunder. An attack using this
ammunition deals that type of damage.

##### Forceful Impact

When you hit with an attack using this ammunition, the target also pops
free from each enemy engaged with it.

##### Keen

When you make an attack with this ammunition, the crit range of that
attack expands by 1 (usually 18+ including the default bonus).

##### Lethal Strike

You deal +1d10 damage on a hit (champion: +2d10; epic: +4d10).

##### Lucky Stray

On a miss, you can make a basic ranged attack against another foe that
is near the target or along your line of sight to the target (between
you and the original target or past the original target).

##### Nemesis

This ammunition has been enchanted against one of the following groups
of monsters: dragon, giant, orc, or undead. An attack against the
designated nemesis with this ammunition can be rerolled once if it
misses. When you use this ammunition, however, it allows each monster of
the same group to reroll one attack against you that misses this battle.
If you use this type of ammunition two or more times against the same
creature group this battle, monsters of that type can instead reroll
each attack against you that misses this battle (once per attack).

##### Seeking

You deal +4 damage on a miss (champion: +10; epic: +25).

##### Twin

When you attack with twin ammunition, a second projectile materializes
out of the first and targets the same or a different enemy. Make a free
action basic ranged attack for it with a +8 attack bonus instead of your
normal bonus (champion: +12; epic: +16).

##### Vulnerability

When you hit with an attack using this ammunition, if the target is from
the same tier or lower than the ammunition, it's also vulnerable to all
attacks until the start of your next turn.

##### Wing-clipper

When you hit with an attack using this ammunition, if the target is from
the same tier or lower than the ammunition, it loses the *flight*
ability (save ends). If the target is presently flying, it must attempt
to land during its next turn.

#### Champion

##### Flaming

Bursts into fire as it flies. You deal 8 extra ongoing fire damage on a
hit (epic: 20 ongoing fire).

#### Epic

##### Death

When you hit with this ammunition and deal damage, if the target has 40
hp or fewer after the hit, the creature drops to 0 hp. If it hits but
fails to drop its target, the ammunition is not used up. It must of
course be retrieved.

##### Uncanny

It warps the forces of necessity and miracle as it flies. When you
attack with this ammunition, use the target's lowest defense instead of
the defense your attack would normally target.

### Armor, Robe, Shirt, Tunic

Most magic armor powers can apply to heavy armor, light armor, or even
no armor (robes or other clothing).

#### Default Bonus

+1 AC (adventurer); +2 AC (champion); +3 AC (epic).

#### Adventurer

##### Clever Step 

(Usually light armor)

You gain a +4 bonus to all defenses against opportunity attacks. Quirk:
Likes to dance little jigs.

##### Heedlessness

You gain a +4 bonus to all defenses during your first turn in battle.
Quirk: Needlessly provocative.

##### Iron Will

The default AC bonus applies to Mental Defense as well. Quirk: Prone to
abstract speculation.

##### Last Stand 

(Usually heavy armor)

You gain a +4 bonus to AC while you have no recoveries left. Quirk: Has
a high pain tolerance.

##### Perfection

(Usually heavy armor)

You gain a +1 bonus to all defenses while at maximum hit points. Quirk:
Made uneasy by the sight of blood.

##### Perseverance

(Quick action -- daily)

If you are staggered, you regain an expended power as if you had taken a
quick rest. You automatically regain a once-per-battle power, but a
recharge power requires a successful recharge roll. You can regain a
racial power, class power, or magic item power this way. Quirk: Repeats
stories over and over.

##### Splendor

Enemies engaged with you take a --2 attack penalty against allies
without splendor. Quirk: Fastidious about clothing and gear.

##### Stone Flesh

The default AC bonus applies to Physical Defense as well. Quirk:
Extremely stubborn.

##### Warding

You gain resistance 12+ against attacks targeting Physical Defense or
Mental Defense. Quirk: Stretches and meditates whenever inactive.

### Belt, Swordbelt, Kilt, Skirt, Girdle, Sash

#### Default Bonus

Increase your maximum recoveries: by 1 (adventurer); by 2 (champion); by
3 (epic).

#### Optional Default Bonus

Don't increase your recoveries depending on the tier. Instead, the item
gives you one extra recovery. But when you heal using that recovery, you
don't roll and the hit points you heal depend on the tier of the item:
20 hp (adventurer); 50 hp (champion); 125 hp (epic).

#### Adventurer

##### Blademaster's Belt

One magical sword sheathed on this belt gains a +2 bonus to recharge
rolls for its own powers. Quirk: Worries too much about tiny details.

##### Brutal Vigor

(Recharge 6+)

When you rally, make a basic attack. Quirk: Plays with their weapons.

##### Glorious Rally

When you rally, you gain 4 temporary hit points that last until the end
of your next turn (champion: 10 temp hp; epic: 25 temp hp).

##### Heroic Resolve

(Recharge 11+)

You can use a recovery to prevent all damage from an attack (including
ongoing damage), but not effects. Quirk: Has terrible heartburn.

##### Last Word

When you heal using your last remaining recovery, you heal 30 additional
hit points (champion 75 hp; epic: 200 hp). Quirk: Stubbornly
independent.

##### Potion Belt

(Recharge 16+)

Drink a potion stored on this belt as a quick action instead of a
standard action. (It also provides slots for up to six potions.) Quirk:
Constantly attempts to refill everyone else's drinks. Or potions. Or
ration bags.

##### Resilience

(Recharge 16+)

When you rally, you can use a second recovery to heal after using the
first (and seeing the recovery roll). Quirk: Grinningly optimistic.

##### Victory by Inches

You must carry a single magic melee weapon that you keep attached to
this item for it to manifest its power. When using that weapon, apply
the weapon's magic bonus to miss damage. Quirk: Have a hard time taking
no for an answer.

#### Champion

##### Resurgence

(Recharge 16+)

When you drop to 0 hit points or lower, heal using a recovery before
falling unconscious. Quirk: Bursts forth with wildly optimistic comments
from time to time.

##### Sash of Suppleness

(Recharge 6+)

A silky sash worn as a belt. When an attack hits your AC and deals 16
damage or less, change that hit into a miss (epic: 40 damage or less).
Quirk: Always stretching, even when it would be more polite or sensible
to not be doing so.

#### Epic

##### Kilt of the Mad Archmage

(Recharge 11+)

When you drop one or more foes with an arcane spell attack, heal using a
recovery and gain a +4 bonus to attack rolls with spells until the end
of your next turn. Quirk: Roll eyes and giggle too often for comfort.

##### Totem Kilt

A hide-and-fur skirt bedecked with garish tribal charms, totemic
symbols, and spirit knots. You can reroll the first death save you make
each battle. Add +2 to the roll. Quirk: Sometimes speaks with the voices
of ancestors.

##### Vitality

Whenever you take ongoing damage, roll an immediate save to end the
effect without taking damage first. Quirk: Fascinated by patterns.

### Book, Scroll, Tome, Grimoire

Mastering a book requires a course of study and practice, usually
accomplished over a day or more. Sometimes a book will reject a reader,
leaving them either confounded or disturbed.

#### Default Bonus

None.

#### Adventurer

##### Codex of Foreshadowed Victory

(Recharge 16+)

When you roll initiative, gain a +10 bonus to your roll after seeing it.
Quirk: Jumpy.

##### Manual of Enlightened Flesh

You gain a +1 bonus to all skill checks based on Str, Con, or Dex.
Quirk: Takes heightened satisfaction in their own physical prowess.

##### Scroll of the Fortuitous Outlook

#### Champion

##### Manual of Puissant Skill at Arms

(Recharge 11+)

When you miss with a melee attack, reroll the attack using +15 as your

checking self out and flexing, and seems to want to be caught doing
that.

### Bracers

Bracers occupy the same chakra as magic melee weapons.

Monks get magic-weapon style powers from magical bracers. A monk wearing
magical bracers can't use a magical melee weapon at the same time.

Non-monks generally don't benefit from bracers.

Bracers have the same types of powers as other melee weapons. Use the
melee weapon magic items to determine bracer powers, and assign one of
the following monk-specific quirks.

-   Speaks too often in terse shouted syllables.

-   So disciplined that dancing, hanging out, and even sitting down is a
    mental hurdle.

-   Unable to sleep without performing an exhausting workout first.

-   Certain that intimacy with another being depletes one's ki.

-   Unable to avoid helping smaller innocent creatures in distress.

    group, community, or adventuring band.

-   Unable to curse or say negative things about people, even if they
    are true.

-   Uncomfortable sleeping in the same spot they slept in the night
    before.

-   Likes to paint watercolors in their spare time.

-   Longs for victory in official martial tournaments.

    centuries.

-   Always uses a quick action to pose over the prone body of a
    just-defeated foe.

-   Corrects everyone else's posture, sometimes even in the middle of
    battle.

-   Has a fondness for sweets, followed by a punishment regimen of only
    fish soup.

-   Compelled to climb stairs using their hands instead of feet.

-   Insists on always moving silently, breezing in and out of situations
    that in social terms require small noises and acknowledgements.

-   Can't abide "fancy" food without heartburn (or at least complaints
    of heartburn).

-   Insists on being the first to go into a room.

#### Default Bonus

Physical defense: +1 PD (adventurer); +2 PD (champion); +3 PD (epic).

#### Adventurer

When an attack or effect deals ongoing damage to you that a save ends,
you can roll an immediate save against it. Quirk: Doesn't notice social

finest things in life; of course, they are elven.

defending.

#### Epic

##### Ambidexterity

(Recharge 11+)

turn while wielding a weapon in your off-hand, make a melee attack with
the weapon in your off-hand as a free action, using +10 as your attack
bonus (champion: +15; epic: +20). Quirk: Writes with both hands at the
same time on different parts of the page. It freaks people out.

##### Arcane Contact

These gloves improve your ability to contact, detect, and distinguish
supernatural forces, provided you can touch some material object
connected to a force. If, for example, you are improvising a ritual to
gain a vision related to the scary artifact you just found, touching the
artifact will help. The benefit is modest, determined by the GM, and
possibly secret. The gloves provide no protection against the
supernatural forces that touching an artifact might usher into your
soul. Quirk: Always cracks knuckles.

##### Archer's Gauntlets

(Recharge 16+)

When you miss with a ranged weapon attack, reroll it using +10 as your
attack bonus (champion: +15; epic: +20). Quirk: You're quiet. Too quiet.

but you know it's all in their minds and often explain that to them.

##### Jeweled Glove

(Recharge 6+)

When you cast a divine spell, allow one nearby ally to roll a save
against one ongoing save ends effect as a free action. Quirk:
Alternately paranoid that people are looking too closely at your
precious jeweled glove and upset that people aren't paying enough
attention to your amazing jeweled glove.

##### Musical Touch

While you wear these fine silk gloves, you can play any musical
instrument without instruction. The gloves, however, don't make you any
more of a musician than you already are. Quirk: Hums and picks up tunes
easily.

##### Sure Fingers

You gain a +2 bonus to any skill check that involves sleight of hand,
strength of grip, hand-eye coordination, or similar abilities. Quirk:

Mental defense: +1 MD (adventurer); +2 MD (champion); +3 MD (epic).

#### Adventurer

##### Circlet of Approachability

While wearing this circlet, in regular social situations, you appear to
others as someone who belongs there. You easily fit in with new groups
of people, unless there is some particular reason for others to be
suspicious. The circlet has no power in unusual social situations.
Quirk: Peppers speech with needless foreign words.

##### Helm of Fortunate Dodging

(Recharge 11+, and see below)

When an enemy misses you with an attack against your AC or PD, change
that miss into a fumble (no damage or possibly a negative outcome).

amazing dream I had last night."

damage). Quirk: Stares into space often.

##### Helm of the Undaunted Hero

(Recharge 6+): When your turn starts, roll a save against one ongoing
save ends effect. Quirk: Favors traditional battle hymns.

##### Skullcap of Wit

You can banter with a lively wit. If you already have a lively wit, it
doesn't make much of a difference. Interpret this ability narrowly
enough that it might provide a bonus to a die roll that anyone really
cares about only once in a campaign. Quirk: Banters with lively wit.

#### Epic

##### Crown of the Mighty Strike

(Recharge 16+)

This slim but elegant crown wants to share your glory and thus needs you
to be glorious. It continually presses you to take bold actions. If the
escalation die is 3+, use your next daily attack power this battle as a
quick action. Quirk: Likely to make bold statements or undertake bold

left (champion: two or fewer, epic: three or fewer). Quirk: Loves

The stones in the necklace breathe, ever so slightly. You gain a +5
bonus to death saves, if failure would kill you. You also gain a +5
bonus to last gasp saves. Quirk: Chides others for taking risks when
they have lesser magical protection.

##### Momentous Harmony

The pendant brings out the best in other magic items you carry, so that
their quirks turn more positive, or at least become weaker if they cause
trouble. If you go over your magic item limit, the pendant ceases to
function (including the default bonus) and the formerly subdued magic
items express themselves with renewed fervor. Quirk: Treats all their
magic items well---talks to them as if they're alive, refers to them as
"children," etc.

##### Paragon

(Recharge 16+)

This necklace changes shape and jewels depending on the race of the
wearer. When you use this necklace, you gain another use of your racial
power in the battle. Quirk: Sometimes unwittingly speaks in a language
that sounds like it could be the original language of their race, if
anyone else could understand it.

##### Water Breathing

(Recharge 6+)

This band of aquamarine and pearls enables you to breathe water for a

whatever that entails). Everyone can see it, even if they don't know
why. Quirk: Becomes more and more obsessed with the idea that all their
accomplishments are undeserved and that they themselves are frauds. This
obsession often drives them to heroic acts.

##### Instant Vengeance

When you take damage from an enemy's attack, choose one ally you can
see. That ally can make a basic attack (melee or ranged) against the
attacker as a free action. Quirk: Sticks close to their friends, real
close.

##### Iron Grip

When you make a skill check involving climbing, holding something, or
otherwise using your hands to grip things, you can use +10 as your bonus
in place of your normal bonus (level + ability mod + background; other
magic item bonuses still count) (champion: +15; epic: +20). Quirk: Loves
to arm wrestle, thumb wrestle, drum fingers on tables, etc.

##### Jack of All Trades

When you make a skill check, if your background bonus for that check is
+1 or +0, you gain a +2 bonus for your background bonus instead (if your
bonus is +2 or higher, this ring has no effect). Quirk: Talks as though
they know everything.

##### Relentless Strike

(Standard action -- recharge 16+)

Make a basic attack ignoring any effects that give you an attack
penalty, prevent you from attacking, keep you from taking actions, or

##### Thief's-Eye

While the ring is on your finger, if you shut both eyes and concentrate,
you can see through the ring, allowing you to peer around corners and
such. Quirk: You're always prying into things that should maybe be left
shut; doors, topics of conversation, taboos....

##### Wild Heart

Animals accept you and may even show you affection. The animals,
however, still react normally if you threaten them, and well-trained
guard animals are especially wary of you. Quirk: Seems out of place in
civilization.

### Shield

by +25 (epic).

On a hit, the attack deals 2d6 damage; on a miss, it deals 2 damage
(champion: 4d8 damage, or 5 on a miss; epic: 8d10 damage, or 12 on
miss). Quirk: Compares everything to dragons or to draconic things, and
judges actions by how they stack up to draconic expectations.

##### Termination

(Recharge 6+)

When you make a basic melee attack, roll a save against one ongoing
damage effect. Quirk: Continually fails to finish sentences, stopping in

individual item power once ever. Quirk: Becomes certain that they are
destined to rule.

### Symbol, Holy Symbol, Relic, Sacred Branch

Sometimes a symbolic magic item is a gem or rune that can be attached to
any of various holy symbols. Typically a divine spellcaster pries the
gem or other adornment off a foreign holy symbol and affixes it to their
own mundane holy symbol. Symbols are only appropriate for adventurer-
and champion-level characters. For epic-level spellcasting items, get a
staff.

contests.

##### Liberation

(Melee weapon -- quick action -- recharge 6+)

If you have attacked with this weapon this turn, allow an ally to roll a
save against an ongoing save ends effect as a free action. Quirk: Drones
on about how healing grace will save all the worlds.

##### Mauling

(Two-handed melee weapon -- move action)

You gain a +1 attack bonus to your next attack you make this turn.
Quirk: Yells battle cries during battle.

##### Mighty Swing

(Two-handed melee weapon -- move action)

You deal +1d8 damage with your next melee attack with this weapon that
hits this turn (champion: +2d8; epic: +4d8). If you miss, you take that
damage instead. Quirk: Tends to break things.

##### No Mercy

(Ranged weapon)

If your target is attempting to flee from the battle, a natural even hit
against it is a critical hit instead. Quirk: Develops a surprising
lip-curl sneer that shows up a bit too often.

##### Protection

(Melee weapon -- recharge 6+)

When you make a basic attack with this weapon, gain a +4 bonus to all
defenses until the end of your next turn (champion: +5; epic: +6).
Quirk: Has urges to watch over the helpless or innocent.

##### Puissance

(Melee weapon -- recharge 16+)

When you make a basic attack with this weapon, make a recharge roll for
one power. Quirk: Tremendous appetite for meat.

##### Steady

(Ranged weapon -- recharge 11+)

Before rolling a ranged attack with this weapon, choose 10 as the
natural roll for that attack. Quirk: Talks too much about the weather.

##### Unstinting Virtue

(Melee weapon -- recharge 11+)

When you make a basic attack with this weapon, roll a save against a
save ends effect. Quirk: Insists that all weakness is an illusion.

##### Vanity

(Melee weapon)

When you hit with this weapon, deal +1d6 damage to that enemy if you are
the only one engaged with it (champion: +2d6; epic: +4d6). Quirk: Tells
their name (their real one) to everyone.

##### Vengeance

(Melee weapon)

When you hit with this weapon while you are staggered, deal +1d6 damage
to that enemy. Quirk: Quick to take offense.

#### Champion

##### Longbow of Fallen Grace

(+3 longbow -- recharge 16+)

If your elven grace racial ability roll failed this turn, use the
natural result of this bow's attack roll as another elven grace roll,
after you see the roll. Quirk: Complains too often that the glorious
centuries of old are gone forever.

##### Mighty Stunning

(One-handed blunt 1d6 melee weapon -- recharge 16+)

When you roll a natural even hit with this weapon and have more hit
points than the target, that creature is also stunned until the end of
its next turn. Quirk: Warns of impending doom.

##### Reckless

(Melee weapon -- recharge 6+)

Reroll one of your attack rolls with a +4 bonus. In addition, until the
end of the battle, enemies attacking you add the escalation die to their
attack roll (no effect if the enemy already adds it for some reason).
Quirk: Low impulse control, particularly when it comes to impulsive
movements through doors, onto railings, or over tables.

#### Epic

##### Greatsword of Utter Night

(+3 greatsword -- recharge 6+)

When you hit with this weapon, you spirit away that enemy and yourself
to an empty void beyond time where only the two of you face each other
for a short time. Neither you nor your foe can move, but you can sure
fight. Your enemy acts first, then you, and then you are both spirited
back to the real world exactly where you were when the power triggered.
Bystanders only see a flash of black. Quirk: Has disturbing dreams that
can't be remembered, or at the very least must not be.

##### Incomparable Axe of Wyrm Chopping

(+3 axe)

miss. The GM determines just how broadly the term "dragon" applies.
Quirk: Speaks in Draconic, first just curses, but then more and more
elements of speech.

### Wondrous Items

You can attune multiple wondrous items. They don't fill up a chakra.

#### Default Bonus

None.

#### Lore Bottle

A bottle of translucent glass, sealed with lead, with a ghastly face
that peers out at you. When you ask it questions, it answers in the form
of vague hunches. For tough questions, the face might fade out for a
while, apparently searching somewhere for an answer. Owning the bottle
gives you +2 bonus to Intelligence-based skill checks, if you have the
time (and privacy) to consult the lore bottle. Chances are, your
particular lore bottle has some sort of specialty or bias, which you
will discover only through use. Unlike most magic items, lore bottles
can often be found for sale, but you probably don't want those. Quirk:
The connection formed with the face in the bottle can be compelling and
unsettling, as the spirit literally "gets in your head." Each bottle has
a different effect on its owner.

#### Dwarven Mug

One in four mugs of ale you drink from this mug will be magically
transformed into the very finest non-magical dwarven ale. If your
relationship with the mug is good, the variety might even suit your
current mood and the odds of getting a good brew might improve in your
favor. But really, who's going to complain about putting down a second,
or even third, mug for the chance to get a taste of the best stuff? When
that excellent ale does show up, you can share a sip or two with a
friend, but other attempts to capitalize on this mug's magic will just
shut it down until it can find a more suitable owner. Quirk: Speaks in
dwarven, especially while drunk, even if ordinarily unable to speak
dwarven.

#### Rope of Entangling

Fifty feet of fine, spidersilk rope, woven so closely that it seems like
a solid, flexible cable. Once you attune the rope during a full heal-up,
you can make it entangle things with standard action commands. In
combat, it's not that useful, because it's slow compared to a living
thing. If the target is stationary, however, the rope excels at
reaching, climbing, snaking, coiling, and entangling. You might be able
to get the rope to bind a ferocious monster, but the rope is likely to
get destroyed in the process. Quirk: Speaks in sentences for which
"convoluted" is the only proper term.

### Chuul Symbiote Magic Items

***Quirks:*** Chuul-derived items are symbiotic, weaving their flesh
with the flesh of their wielder. Instead of affecting the personality of
the wielder, their quirk is that they warp the wielder's body in minor
yet often disturbing ways. Over-attuning causes obviously monstrous
mutations that are hard to hide.

***Chuulish Recharge:*** Chuulish items draw life energy and vital
essences directly from their hosts. Any chuul-derived item that has a
recharge has the following *chuulish recharge* rule.

The item has a recharge roll like normal magic items, but it's easier to
recharge it if the user is willing to use their own life force to help.
These items recharge normally on 16+, or on 11+ for a cumulative --1
penalty to all saves until the next full heal-up, or on 6+ for a
cumulative --2 penalty to all saves until the next full heal-up, or
recharge without a roll for a cumulative --3 penalty to all saves until
the next full heal-up.

#### Chitin Claw

(ring)

This fleshy multi-eyed loop sheaths a finger in sharp carapace.
*Always:* When you pick a lock, disarm a trap, or otherwise perform a
task that having a tiny shape-changing blade and tiny eyes attached to
your finger would be aided by, you gain a +2 bonus to the roll. *Quirk:*
Gnarled over-long fingers on that hand.

#### Chuul Helm

(helm)

This insectile segmented helm is lined with ganglia that link with your
brain. *Always:* +1 MD (adventurer); +2 MD (champion); +MD (epic).
*Chuulish recharge:* You gain *resist psychic 12+* until the end of the
battle (champion: *resist psychic 16+*; epic: *resist psychic 18+*).
*Quirk:* Bone-ridged holes in skull.

#### Chuulish Cuirass

(heavy armor)

The many eyes and symbiotic nervous system in this torso armor give you
warning of danger. *Always:* +1 AC (adventurer); +2 AC (champion); +3 AC
(epic). *Chuulish recharge:* You gain a +4 bonus to all defenses against
ranged attacks until the end of the battle. *Quirk:* Over-large
protruding ribs.

#### Clawed Tentacles

(gloves)

These claw-covered tentacles normally reside under the skin of the
forearm, completely concealed. *Chuulish recharge:* Choose an enemy
engaged with you. Until the end of the battle, whenever that enemy tries
to disengage from you or pop free from you, it must first succeed at an
easy save (champion: normal save; epic: hard save). *Quirk:* Tentacles
writhe in and out of the skin unexpectedly.

#### Death Claw

(gloves)

A lobster-clawed gauntlet that fits over your forearm. The eyes at the
fleshy joints blink unnervingly. *Chuulish recharge:* Reroll a missed
melee attack with a +1 attack bonus (champion: +2; epic: +3). *Quirk:*
The claw flexes and snaps reflexively when wearer is excited.

#### Evil Eyes

(gloves)

This gauntlet has eyes on the knuckles, aiding archers and spellcasters.
*Always:* Bonus to attacks and damage with ranged attacks: +1
(adventurer); +2 (champion); +3 (epic). The bonus doesn't stack with
bonuses from magic weapons or implements. *Chuulish recharge:* Until the
end of the battle or for five minutes, you can see the unseen. Invisible
creatures are visible to you, and you spot illusions for what they are.
*Quirk:* Bone ridges and oddly patterned callouses on the arms.

#### Glandular Parasite

(cloak/mantle

The parasite sits along your spine, feeding off your life force but also
dampening your reactions to extreme stimuli and pain. *Always:* +1 PD
(adventurer); +2 PD (champion); +3 PD (epic). *Chuulish recharge:* You
are immune to fear effects until the end of the battle or for five
minutes. *Quirk:* Strangely pronounced spine.

#### Implanted Aventail

(light armor)

The symbiote is normally hidden. When commanded, a wave of small
crab-like creatures pours out of concealed gill-like openings in your
skin, providing you with scale-like armor. *Always:* +1 AC (adventurer);
+2 AC (champion); +3 AC (epic). Unleashing the armor is a quick action,
and you retain the AC bonuses as long as it is in place. When the
insects are retracted as a move action, you don't appear to be (or count
as) wearing armor. *Quirk:* Gill-like slits cover body even when the
armor is not up.

#### Neural Blade

(any bladed weapon)

A boney blade with a spine and brain. *Always:* Bonus to attacks and
damage: +1 (adventurer); +2 (champion); +3 (epic); and the weapon deals
psychic damage. *Chuulish recharge:* Choose a nearby enemy. That enemy
is now vulnerable to psychic damage until the end of the battle.
*Quirk:* Large sphincters on arm where the ganglia-tentacles from the
blade's hilt insert themselves.

#### Neural Whip

(light one-handed melee weapon)

A tentacle snakes one end around your arm, inserting filaments beneath
the skin. The whip stretches and flexes at your mental command, the tip
studded with hardened pulsing nerves. *Always:* Bonus to attacks and
damage: +1 (adventurer); +2 (champion); +3 (epic). *2/battle:* You can
use a reach trick with the whip (*13^th^ Age* core book, page 44), and
the attack deals psychic damage. *Quirk:* Grows eyes in unusual places.

#### Rachis Girdle

(belt)

The pulsating band of chuul-flesh inside a bony cage sits on your lower
back, exchanging blood and injecting substances into your organs.
*Always:* Increase your maximum hp by +4 (champion: +10 hp; epic: +25
hp). Whenever you take ongoing damage, reduce that damage by your level.
*Quirk:* Odd gait from reconfigured pelvis.

#### Rasping Greaves

(boots)

A carapace covers each of your legs and has an unblinking armored eye on
the knee. Unfolding blade-like appendages whip out at those engaged with
you. *Always:* When you make an opportunity attack, the target takes
+1d6 extra damage on a hit (champion: +2d8; epic: +4d10). *Quirk:* A
billow-like lung inside each greave makes a breathing sound.

#### Strider Symbiote

(cloak/mantle -- champion tier item)

This living "backpack" clings to you with tentacles and inserts
mouthparts into the top of your spine. The segmented limbs of the
strider usually lie flat against your body but may be commanded to
spring out and carry you like a long-legged spider. *Always:* +2 PD
(champion); +3 PD (epic). *Chuulish recharge:* Until the end of the
battle or for five minutes, you can move on walls or ceilings as easily
as you do across the ground. (epic: chuulish recharge starts at 11+)
*Quirk:* Twitching antenna.

#### Xenoteros

(cloak/mantle)

Insectile wings hide in slits under the always itching skin of your
back. *Always:* +1 PD (adventurer); +2 PD (champion); +3 PD (epic).
*Chuulish recharge:* As a standard action, you can fly clumsily for one
round (champion: 1d3 + 1 rounds; epic: 2d4 rounds). *Quirk:* Insectile
mouthparts grow at the back of the throat and squiggle out when wearer
talks excitedly.

### Cursed Magic Items

Cursed items can be useful, though all of them have significant
drawbacks.

*Shadow Dragons*

Players will often find cursed items such as these when approaching a
Shadow Dragon lair. However, detecting the curse on any of these cursed
items requires a DC 35 Intelligence check:

**30 or less:** Nothing seems to be wrong.

**31--34:** Something isn't right about the item. It could be cursed, or
just has a bad quirk.

**35+ or natural 20:** The item is cursed!

**Natural roll is 1--5:** The creature attempting to discern the item's
magic accidentally attunes to the cursed item!

#### General

##### Dancing Shoes

(boots)

Shiny red shoes with golden wings. *Always:* The shoes force you to
dance whenever you hear music (even off-key whistling will work). The
shoes magically re-appear on your feet if taken off for more than 10
minutes. *Recharge 6+:* You gain a +3 bonus to disengage checks until
the end of the battle (or five minutes).

##### Deck of Many Cards

(wondrous item)

A divination deck. *Always:* The deck of cards continually grows, and
you find your pockets and pouches filling with cards that spill out
leaving a trail for anyone to follow. Occasionally, the cards spill out
in a prophetic pattern that might have meaning to the owner or an ally.

##### Disappointment Hat

(hat)

Green conical hat. *Always:* Each time you cast a spell outside of
combat or a spell is cast near you, it has some side effect (GM's
choice) that inconveniences you. *Recharge 6+:* As a move action you
pull out an item from the hat. Roll a d6 to see what you get: 1--2: You
get a useless or disgusting item. 3--6: You pull a useful non-magical
item that grants a +d6 bonus to your next skill check until the end of
your next turn.

##### Tome of Misfortune

(implement)

Book with an embossed face inside its cover. *1/day:* Regain one
expended daily spell that you have cast. When you cast the recovered
spell, roll a d6. 1--3: The book chooses the targets for the spell and
can consider you and your allies as enemies, or your enemies as allies.
4--6: You choose targets normally.

##### Treasured Chest

(wondrous item)

It follows you on little feet, obeys you, and is much larger on the
inside (able to hold the same amount of stuff as a large closet).
*Always:* You can't move faster than the chest, and the chest is slow.
You travel at half speed everywhere and can't use actions to move twice
during a turn in battle.

#### Adventurer

##### Acrobat's Stick

(staff)

A glowing rod that expands into a longer pole. *Always:* Bonus to
attacks and damage: +2 (adventurer). In addition, if you are a rogue
with the *swashbuckle* ability, you gain an extra use of that ability,
but whenever you roll a natural 1 or 2 with any d20 roll, the staff
flings you into danger (you take 2d6 damage and possibly provoke
opportunity attacks in battle).

##### Anger Armor

(heavy armor)

Platemail or similar with leering faces on the pauldrons. *Always:* +2
AC (adventurer). In addition, when you miss with an attack and the
escalation die is odd, roll a save; on a failure, you are enraged until
the start of your next turn and take a --4 penalty to all defenses.

##### Backbiter Bow

(bow)

Gold bow with no string. It creates a glowing string and "energy
arrows." *Always:* Bonus to attacks and damage: +2 (adventurer). In
addition, when you miss with an attack and the escalation die is odd,
roll a save; on a failure, you instead hit yourself with the attack.

##### Blade of Unerring Panache

hp; epic: 25 hp). Quirk: Tells the same stories over and over.

as it deflects melee attacks. *Always:* +3 AC (champion) against melee

(heavy two-handed melee weapon)

A strangely glowing crude wooden club. *Always:* Bonus to attacks and

to find traps and see through illusions.

#### Epic

Any lower item bumped up, or...

(shield)

A fancy cavalier's shield. *Always:* +35 hp (epic). In addition, when

check, take opportunity attacks).

##### Danger Bracers

(light armor)

Chains welded into forearm armor. *Always:* +4 AC (epic). In addition,
you can't disengage from enemies.

##### Procrastination Tome

(implement)

This book contains instructions for being a better spellcaster.
*Always:* Bonus to spell attacks and damage: +5 (epic). In addition,
during the first round of each battle you must spend all your actions
either moving or "limbering up." This means not using any abilities,
you're just jogging and stretching.

##### Great Low Sickle

(+5 weapon)

You deal +5 damage with missed attacks, but all of your defenses take a
--3 penalty.

##### Staff of Dark Karma

(3/day)

When you hit with a spell attack, deal extra damage to one target. If
