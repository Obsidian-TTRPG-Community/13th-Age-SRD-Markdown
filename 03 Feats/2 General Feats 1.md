# General Feats

These are general feats available to any character. A character can’t take a specific feat more than once. A few general feats only have adventurer-tier versions; others also have champion- and epic-tier versions that can be added later in your career.

> __13th Age SRD Markdown Note__: An all-in-one list is maintained here, and the Feats are also kept in individual files in the Feats folder for character sheets/linking purposes if needed. You may delete them if you do not need them. 

## Further Backgrounding

__Adventurer Tier__
Add a total of 2 points to backgrounds you already have, or choose 2 points of new backgrounds that make sense for your character. 

`You still can’t go over the 5-point-per- background maximum.`

__Champion Tier__
Add a total of 3 points to backgrounds you already have, or choose 3 points of new backgrounds that make sense for your character. 

`You still can’t go over the 5-point-per- background maximum.`

__Epic Tier__
Add a total of 2 points to backgrounds you already have, or choose 2 points of new backgrounds that make sense for your character. 

`These points can take one of your backgrounds over 5, to a maximum of 7.`


## Improved Initiative

__Adventurer Tier__

Gain a +4 bonus to Initiative checks.


## Linguist

__Adventurer Tier__

This feat allows you to speak enough arcana, dwarven, elven, gnomish, gnoll, goblin, orcish, and other standard humanoid languages to comprehend enough of what most other humanoids are saying or screaming during battle. 

You are not fluent in all these languages, no one will mistake you for a native speaker, and your vocabulary is adventurer-centric (heavy on words connected to danger rather than philosophy or emotions).

You can also read enough to get by in all these languages.

__Champion Tier__

You can speak, read, and write all the humanoid languages fluently. Stranger languages are no problem for you either. If someone is speaking it, you can figure it out.

## Precise Shot

__Adventurer Tier__

When your ranged attack targets an enemy who is engaged with an ally, you have no chance of hitting that ally.
