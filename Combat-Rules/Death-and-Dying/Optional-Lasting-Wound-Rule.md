## Optional Lasting-Wound Rule

If youâ€™re dropped to 0 hp or below one or more times during a fight, you take a lasting-wound. Each lasting-wound reduces your maximum hp by an amount equal to 2 + your level. Lasting-wounds are cumulative. *Staggered* is still half or less of your maximum hit points. A full heal-up removes all lasting-wounds.
