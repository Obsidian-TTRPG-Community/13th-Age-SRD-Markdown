## Death and Dying

When you drop to 0 hp or below, you fall unconscious and can’t take any actions (except to make death saves).

To make a death save, roll a d20 at the start of your turn. If you roll 16+, use a recovery to return to consciousness and heal up to the number of hit points you rolled with your recovery. If you roll a natural 20, you get to take actions normally that turn. If you roll 15 or less, you take one step toward the grave. After the fourth failed death save in a single battle, you die.

You also die when you reach negative hit points equal to half your maximum hit points.

If you’re able to use one of your recoveries (or otherwise get healed) while you are dying, ignore your current negative hit points. Start from 0 and add the hit points you’ve regained.

If one of your allies is unconscious and you don’t have magic to heal them, you can still stabilize them to keep them from dying. Get next to them and make a DC 10 healing skill check using Wisdom as a standard action. Failure wastes your standard action, but doesn’t hurt your friend. Success stabilizes your ally. If your stabilization check is 25+, you treat their wounds so quickly that it only takes a quick action; you can use your standard action normally that turn.

A stabilized character is still unconscious, rolling death saves on their turn, but failed death saves no longer take them a step closer to death. Ignore failed death saves while stabilized.

Feeding a dying character a healing potion gets them conscious and back on their feet, but always takes a standard action.
