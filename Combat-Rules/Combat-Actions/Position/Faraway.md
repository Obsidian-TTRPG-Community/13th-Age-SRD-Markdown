## Faraway

Generally, the heroes and their enemies are nearby each other and you can use a single move action to reach any of them (provided no enemy intercepts you). If you want to be faraway, two moves away from the enemies, make that clear to the GM and make sure thereâ€™s room for that maneuver. Wizards and other casters sometimes like to be faraway.
