## Saves

The save mechanic, a d20 roll with no standard modifiers, handles everything from power recharge to saves against power effects to death saves. There are three difficulty values for saves. If a save doesn’t specify what type it is, it’s a normal save: 11+.

- **Easy:** Roll 6+ on a d20

- **Normal:** Roll 11+ on a d20

- **Hard:** Roll 16+ on a d20

There are no standard bonuses to saves, but there are occasional talents, feats, and magic items that provide small bonuses to saves.
