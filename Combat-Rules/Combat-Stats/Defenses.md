#### Defenses

There are three different defenses: Armor Class, Physical Defense, and  
Mental Defense. Each uses three ability scores as part of its  
calculation. PCs also add their class level to their defenses.

##### Armor Class (AC)

AC protects you from weapon attacks. It is equal to the middle value  
among Con, Dex, and Wis. Disregard the higher and the lower values.

##### Physical Defense (PD)

PD protects you from other physical attacks. It is equal to the middle  
value among Str, Con, and Dex. Disregard the higher and the lower  
values.

##### Mental Defense (MD)

MD protect you against mental attacks. It is equal to the middle value  
among Int, Wis, and Cha. Disregard the higher and the lower values.
