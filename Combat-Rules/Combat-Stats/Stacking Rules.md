#### Stacking Rules

Bonuses and effects to a single stat stack with each other, with these  
exceptions:

- Magic item bonuses don’t stack. Only the best one counts.

- Many condition penalties don’t stack. Only the worst one counts.

- Powers, spells, and abilities don’t stack with themselves or with  
  other game elements with the same name. This works for both PCs and  
  monsters.
