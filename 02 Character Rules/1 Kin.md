# Kin
Every character has a kin (see Kinships). Pick one for your character. If you want to make a non-standard kin for your character, the rules wonâ€™t hinder you. The system is designed to be flexible enough to allow for improvisation.

Each kinship provides a +2 bonus to one of your [ability scores](3%20Abilities.md).
