## Magic Item Basics

Some magic items are available at any level, with greater bonuses or other effects for champion- and epic-tier versions. Others can be found only at champion or epic levels.

### Default Bonuses

Default Bonuses are on unless they specify otherwise. Magic necklaces have the only default bonus that is defined as provisional, a save bonus that kicks in when your hit points are low.

### Magic Item Powers

Unless otherwise specified, magic item powers with a recharge chance have to be activated and require a free action to use. They will also have a trigger condition that you must meet to use the item.

Magic item powers that do not specify a recharge chance or a specific usage pattern have powers that are always available.

The majority of magic item powers list a recharge number (6+, 11+, or 16+). You can count on using a recharge power once a day, but subsequent uses depend on successful recharge rolls. After the battle in which you’ve used an item’s power, roll a `dice: 1d20`. If your roll equals or exceeds the recharge number for that item, you can use that item power again that day. If the roll fails, the item power is expended until you take a full heal-up.
