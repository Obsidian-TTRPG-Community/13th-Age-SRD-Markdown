# Multiclassing Basics

This is the guide to creating a multiclass character. If there’s an element of character class configuration not mentioned, assume that it works the same for multiclass characters as it does for single-class characters.

For character class specifics, see below. Note that many multiclasses offer bonus feats that help make up for some disadvantages when multiclassing.

## Terminology

Your multiclass is a combination of your two classes separated by a slash. There’s no significance to the order. A fighter/wizard is the same as a wizard/fighter.

Technically, the rules presented here are for dual-classing, i.e. combining only two classes.

## Level progression

You gain levels like any other character. For example, a 3rd level fighter/wizard is a 3rd level character, with 3rd level hit points and three feats (or four for a human). You add your level (3) to your attacks, to your defenses, and to your skill checks. You level up as fast as other characters and you never have to worry about gaining specific or separate class levels.

On the other hand, leveling up is not exactly like a single-class character. Multiclass characters have the class powers, attacks, maneuvers, bonus talents, and spells of a character that is one level lower than their actual level.

For example, as a 3rd level fighter/wizard, you’ll use the fighter and wizard level progression tables for 2nd level. In this example, as a fighter, you’ll know 4 maneuvers and they’ll all still have to be from the 1st level pool. As a wizard, you’ll know six 1st level spells. At 4th level, you then gain the maneuvers of a single-class 3rd level fighter and the spells of a single-class 3rd level wizard.

What you get as a 1st level multiclass character
Each multiclass option in the class-by-class list’s level progression sections tells you what you get as a 1st level character when your class abilities are a level lower.

### Talents as a 1st level character

Choose one talent from each of your two class choices. Then choose your third talent from either of those classes.

### Bonus talents as part of class progression

If your class gets bonus talents (barbarian, commander, fighter, monk, occultist, paladin, ranger), you still get them, but at one level later than a single-class character does.

## Class features

Many classes contribute all of their class features to a multiclass. Others only allow some class features, or limit you from taking some talents or feats. The details are in the class-by-class multiclass list.

### Ability score bonuses at character creation

You can select your ability score class bonus from the options available to either of your classes. For example, if you are a fighter/wizard, you can gain a single +2 class bonus to Strength, Constitution, Intelligence, or Wisdom.

### Key ability scores & key modifiers

To be fully effective, multiclass characters have to be good in at least two ability scores, generally one for each class.

A multiclass character uses a special modifier for most of their attacks and other powers, called the key modifier. This modifier is the lower of two ability modifiers determined by your particular class combination. You use the key modifier whenever you would use either of those two ability scores for an attack or an effect of powers or spells.

You don’t necessarily use the key modifier for all attacks, only for attacks that would normally use one of the two ability scores in question. For example, a bard/cleric whose key modifier is Wis/Cha would use that modifier for all their spell attacks based on Wisdom or Charisma, but that character would still make cleric melee attacks with Strength, and bard melee attacks with Strength too.

You don’t use the key ability scores for skill checks. Skill checks live outside the class framework and use your normal ability scores, though if both scores are equal you will not notice the difference.

The Key Modifier table lists the modifier relevant to each multiclass combination. For example, a rogue/wizard’s primary abilities are Dexterity and Intelligence, so that character’s key modifier is the lower of the character’s Dexterity and Intelligence modifiers. You’ll use this key modifier in place of any Dexterity modifier or Intelligence modifier you use for all attacks, powers, spells, and class features or effects from the rogue or wizard class.

Core character stats like AC, PD, MD, and Initiative are not considered elements of your class, so they use the normal ability modifiers rather than the key modifiers.

## Basic attacks

You have the basic attacks from both your classes. If your ability scores suggest that one of your basic attacks is better than the other, each time you make a basic attack you’ll have to specify which class you are using.

## Hit Points

Your hit points are the average of the base HP of your two classes, + CON modifier, multiplied by 3, then rounded down.

## Recovery dice

Average the dice from both classes, then round up to the next higher die size (d6, d8, d10, or d12). For example: d6 + d8 = d8; d6 + d10 = d8; d6 + d12 = d10; d8 + d10 = d10; d8 + d12 = d10; d10 + d12 = d12.

## Armor and AC

Use the highest base AC provided by either of your classes for whichever type of armor you are wearing. However, you also retain the penalties for wearing shields or heavy armor while using attacks and spells from classes that have those penalties.

For example, a 1st level wizard/fighter has a base AC of 16 in heavy armor from the fighter class. But while the character’s fighter attacks would be fine, any of the character’s wizard attacks (including spells) would take a –2 penalty.

## PD & MD

Use the best PD and MD from either of your classes.

## Weapon attacks

Use the better weapon attack abilities among your two classes.

### Weapon damage penalty

Most multiclass characters must drop all of their weapon damage dice down one step. That means d12s become d10s; d10s become d8s; d8s become d6s; d6s become d4s; and d4s stay as d4s. This reduction does NOT apply if your multiclass contains only classes from the following list of skillful warriors: barbarian, bard, commander, fighter, paladin, ranger, or rogue.

If you’re one of the many multiclass characters affected by the weapon damage penalty, it applies only to your own attacks, not to the attacks of animal companions, summoned creatures, and the like.

The reduction also applies when you’ve found a way to gain a larger weapon damage die temporarily. For instance, a cleric casting the hammer of faith spell would get to use d12 damage dice for the rest of the battle, but a fighter/cleric (or any other cleric multiclass) would have to use d10 damage dice with the spell.

## Feats

You can choose feats from either of your classes. You gain one feat per level like everyone else.

## Gear

As a 1st level character, you’ve got all the gear you need from both your classes, as well as the normal starting gold pieces: 25 gp or 10 x d6 gp.
