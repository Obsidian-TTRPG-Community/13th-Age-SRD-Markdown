# Sorcerer Multiclass

You lag one level behind in the spells known columns of the Sorcerer Level Progression table. 

At 1st level, you know three 1st level spells.

## Diverse Gathering

**Adventurer Tier**
Once per day, you can cast a non-sorcerer spell after you have gathered power. You double the damage of the spell as if it were a sorcerer spell.

**Champion Tier**
You can now also gather power for a non-sorcerer spell as per the adventurer-tier feat once per battle while the escalation die is 4+ (so in a four battle day, you could use it up to five times assuming the escalation die allows it).
