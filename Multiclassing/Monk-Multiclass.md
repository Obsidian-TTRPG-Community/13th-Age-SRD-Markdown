# Monk Multiclass

A multiclass monk does get a +2 class bonus to three abilities, but does
not get to use Focus abilities as the other class.

You lag one level behind in the three columns of the Monk Level
Progression table: class talents, forms, and ki.

The multiclass monkâ€™s JAB, PUNCH, and KICK attacks damage dice decrease
one size just like the WEAPON attacks of all classes. Yes, this means
your:
JAB dice are d4s
PUNCH dice are d6s
KICK dice are d8s
