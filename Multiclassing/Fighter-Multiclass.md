# Fighter Multiclass

You lag one level behind two columns of the Fighter Level Progression
Table: Maneuvers Known and Maneuver Pool Available. You also won’t get
the fighter’s normal bonus talent at 6th level, instead
receiving it at 7th level.

As a 1st level multiclass fighter, you start knowing two
maneuvers from the 1st level pool.

## Armored Warfare

### Adventurer Tier

Once per battle while wearing heavy armor, use an attack from a class
that normally takes an attack penalty while wearing heavy armor without
taking that penalty.

### Champion Tier

You can now ignore heavy armor attack penalties while the escalation die
is 3+.
