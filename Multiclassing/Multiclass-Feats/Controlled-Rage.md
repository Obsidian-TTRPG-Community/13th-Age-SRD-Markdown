# Controlled Rage

## Adventurer Tier

You can use powers and attacks from your other class while raging. You can’t use the extra d20 that Barbarian Rage gives you while making an attack from the other class, but at least you can slip out of your rage long enough to use a power or attack from your other class.

## Champion Tier

Once per battle while raging, you can use a melee attack from your other class as if it was a barbarian attack, rolling `dice: 2d20` (2d20) for the attack. 

(Examples of possible uses include a bard’s flexible attack battle cries, a commander attack using the Lead from the Front talent that will garner command points, a fighter’s flexible attacks, a ranger’s double melee attack, and so on.)
