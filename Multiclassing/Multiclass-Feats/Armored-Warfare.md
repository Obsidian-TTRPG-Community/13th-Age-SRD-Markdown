# Armored Warfare

## Adventurer Tier

Once per battle while wearing heavy armor, use an attack from a class that normally takes an attack penalty while wearing heavy armor without
taking that penalty.

## Champion Tier

You can now ignore heavy armor attack penalties while the escalation die is 3+.
