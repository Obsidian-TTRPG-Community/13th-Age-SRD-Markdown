# Seize the Momentum

## Adventurer Tier

Once per day when you hit with an attack from your non-rogue class, you can gain *momentum* as if you had used a rogue attack.

## Champion Tier

In addition to using the adventurer-tier feat once per day, you can also use it once per battle (so in a four-battle day, you could use it five times).
