# Diverse Gathering

## Adventurer Tier

Once per day, you can cast a non-sorcerer spell after you have gathered power. You double the damage of the spell as if it were a sorcerer
spell.

## Champion Tier

You can now also gather power for a non-sorcerer spell as per the adventurer-tier feat once per battle while the escalation die is 4+ (so in a four battle day, you could use it up to five times assuming the escalation die allows it).
