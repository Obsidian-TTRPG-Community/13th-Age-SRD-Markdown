# Continual Warp

## Adventurer Tier

If you have a warp effect already going, drawing the stone from your other class doesn’t cancel the warp effect. The warp effect continues until it’s replaced by another warp effect or the end of the battle, as usual.

## Champion Tier

If you invested in high weirdness, your high weirdness effects don’t stop when you draw a multiclass stone.
