# Commander Multiclass

You lag one level behind in the class-specific elements of the Commander
Level Progression table—so it only affects the number of commands and
tactics you have and the pool you can draw them from.

## Many Fronts

### Adventurer Tier

Once per battle, use a melee attack from your non-commander class in
place of a commander attack when you use your Front Line Fighting
feature.

### Champion Tier

You can now use the adventurer-tier feat twice per battle.
