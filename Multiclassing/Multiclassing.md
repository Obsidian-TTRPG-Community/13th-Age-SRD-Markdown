# Multiclassing

A multiclass character belongs to two classes instead of one. Multiclassing provides versatility—two classes offer more options than one at the expense of raw power.

You can start at 1st level with a multiclass character or convert to being a multiclass character when you gain a level. Changing from a single-class character to a multiclass character during a campaign is often a consequence of some powerful story event.

The core multiclass rule is that you can’t apply a talent, feat, or class feature to a spell or attack from a different class. For example, a barbarian/rogue who is raging makes barbarian attacks, rolling 2d20s to hit, but can’t add rogue Sneak Attack damage on top of the barbarian melee attack. Likewise, a rogue that uses _shadow walk_ has to make a rogue attack upon returning to play, not a barbarian rage attack. Another example: a sorcerer/wizard or sorcerer/cleric can’t gather power as a sorcerer and then get double damage casting a spell from their other class.

Some multiclass feats might break these general rules.

These prohibitions usually don’t apply to effects you create that don’t require actions to maintain. A cleric/barbarian could use an invocation at the start of the battle, cast a spell, and then start raging. The effects of the invocation would continue since it doesn’t require new actions to sustain it.

Rage, on the other hand, is a special case, preventing actions from other classes even though you don’t have to use actions to keep raging.
