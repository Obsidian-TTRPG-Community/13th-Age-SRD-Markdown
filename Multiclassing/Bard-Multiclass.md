# Bard Multiclass

You lag one level behind in the battle cries and spells/songs known
columns of the Bard Level Progression table.

As a 1st level bard, you start with only one 1st level battle cry and one 1st level spell or song.

As usual, the Battle Skald or Spellsinger talents could still add a battle cry or spell/song to what youâ€™re getting as a multiclass bard.

Note that the Jack of Spells advantages would only apply to spells jacked by the talent, not to spells known through the multiclass.

If you multiclass with another class that has flexible attacks, such as the fighter or a druid that takes that talent, consider the two feats that follow. Without the feats, you must always declare whether you are using a bard flexible attack or a flexible attack from your other class.

## True Flexibility

#### Adventurer Tier

Once per battle, as long as both classes use flexible attacks for the type of attack you are making, you can choose to roll a flexible attack without deciding which of your two classes it is linked to. Choose from *all* your flexible attacks after you see the result of the roll.

#### Champion Tier

You can now use the adventurer-tier feat twice per battle.
