## Class Features

All commanders have class features associated with _commands_ and _tactics_.

Commands allow you to help your allies fight better. You issue them as interrupt actions during their turn. To issue a command, the ally must be conscious, but line of sight isn’t required.

All commands are at-will powers, though they do cost command points, and are usually limited to once per round (as an interrupt). You start each battle with 1 command point and generally gain more via the two standard commander features: _Fight from the Front_ and _Weigh the Odds_. Excess command points go away at the end of the battle.

Your powers also include tactics that have immediate effect during your turn. Tactics, as opposed to commands, don’t use command points. You also don’t have to wait around for an ally’s turn to use them. However, tactics don’t always recharge after a battle.

You can choose the commands and tactics you want to use. A 1st-level commander starts with a total of 4 commands and tactics. An effective commander should choose a good balance of commands and tactics.

### Fight from the Front

When you hit with a commander melee attack during your turn, gain 1d3 command points.

#### Adventurer Feat

You now gain 1d4 command points when you hit with a melee attack during your turn instead of 1d3.

#### Champion Feat

When you make a melee attack during your turn and miss with a natural even roll, gain 1 command point.

#### Epic Feat

Twice per day when you hit with a melee attack, you can gain additional command points equal to double your Strength modifier.

### Weigh the Odds

Standard action

**Effect:** Gain 1d4 command points.

#### Adventurer Feat

Once per day, add your Charisma modifier to the number of command points you gain when you use this action.

#### Champion Feat

Once per battle while the escalation die is 3+, you can gain 1d4 command points as a quick action.

#### Epic Feat

You now gain 1d6 command points instead of 1d4 when you use this action.

## Class Talents

Choose three of the following class talents. You get an additional commander talent at 5th level.

### Armor Skills

Unlike other commanders, you take no attack penalties for fighting in heavy armor. (As indicated on your class chart, your base AC in heavy armor is 14.)

#### Adventurer Feat

When an enemy misses you with a melee attack and rolls a natural 1 or 2, you gain 1 command point.

#### Champion Feat

Once per day as a free action when you are hit by an attack that targets AC, you can take half damage from that attack instead.

#### Epic Feat

Once per day as a free action, you can gain a bonus to AC equal to the _current_ escalation die until the end of the battle. (The AC bonus increases or decreases as the escalation die increases or decreases.) This bonus can’t be higher than the number of icon relationship points you have with warrior or leader icons in your game.

### Battle Captain

Once per battle when you have 2 or more command points left after giving a command, you can use another interrupt action on a different ally’s turn before the start of your next turn.

#### Adventurer Feat

You now only need to have 1 or more command points left instead of 2.

#### Champion Feat

You can use this talent twice per battle.

#### Epic Feat

You gain an additional command point at the start of each round while the escalation die is 4+.

### Combat Maneuver

Choose a fighter maneuver of your level or lower. You can use it like a fighter. You can also switch it for a different maneuver each time you level up.

#### Adventurer Feat

You gain the adventurer feat for the maneuver you chose, if any.

#### Champion Feat

Choose a second fighter maneuver of your level or lower to use.

#### Epic Feat

You gain the adventurer and champion tier feats, if any, for both your fighter maneuvers.

### Destined to Lead

When you roll a 5 or 6 on an icon relationship die, you gain 2 bonus command points that last until the end of the current game session, no matter what events occur due to the advantage gained with that icon.

When you use one or more of these bonus command points, tell a story about how something related to the icon (or icons!) comes into play to make you a better/luckier/destined commander.

#### Adventurer Feat

You now gain the 2 bonus command points when you roll a 4 with an icon relationship die as well.

#### Champion Feat

Once per session when you roll icon relationship dice, you can reroll one die that isn’t a 5 or a 6.

#### Epic Feat

When you roll icon relationship dice, for each 6 you get, you and each nearby ally gain a +1 bonus to death saves until the next full heal-up.

### Forceful Command

When you give a command that lets an ally roll a d20 (an attack, a save, etc.), you can spend additional command points before the roll up to the escalation die value, or 1 point if the escalation die is still 0. That ally gains a +2 bonus to the roll for each point you spend this way.

#### Adventurer Feat

You begin each battle with 1 additional command point.

#### Champion Feat

Once per battle, you can use a command on a faraway ally.

#### Epic Feat

Once per day when you use this talent to grant an ally a bonus to a d20 roll, you can also allow that ally to reroll that roll once as a free action.

### Into the Fray

At the start of each battle before you and your allies roll initiative, roll a d4. A number of your allies equal to the roll gain the following benefit of your choice: a +4 bonus to initiative that battle; OR a +2 bonus to AC until the end of the first round.

#### Adventurer Feat

You also gain the chosen bonus.

#### Champion Feat

The +2 bonus to AC also applies to PD and MD.

#### Epic Feat

The chosen allies now gain both bonuses (+2 to all defenses for the first round and +4 to initiative this battle).

### Martial Training

Unlike other commanders, you don’t take a –2 attack penalty when fighting with heavy or martial weapons.

#### Adventurer Feat

You gain 1 command point whenever you roll a natural 19 or 20 with a melee attack.

#### Champion Feat

Twice per day as a free action (once per turn), you can reroll one of your melee attack rolls.

#### Epic Feat

Twice per day as free action (once per turn) when you hit with a melee attack, you can deal 1d10 extra damage to the target for each positive or conflicted icon relationship point you have with warrior or leader icons in your game.

### Moment of Glory

When you roll initiative, also roll a d4 and record the result. As a free action, you can add the result to a single attack roll made by one of your nearby allies later this battle. (It’s a free action, so you can add the result after seeing the roll.)

#### Adventurer Feat

You can also add the d4 result to a save or dicey-move roll made by an ally.

#### Champion Feat

Roll a d6 instead of a d4.

#### Epic Feat

In addition to the d6 you roll with initiative, roll a d4. You can also use that roll the same way, but not during the same turn you use the d6 result.

### Never Say Die

Once per battle when an enemy scores a critical hit against you or a nearby ally, you can increase the escalation die by 1.

#### Adventurer Feat

Once per day, you can use this talent twice in the same battle.

#### Champion Feat

When you use this talent, the target of the critical hit can heal using a recovery.

#### Epic Feat

When you use this talent, you and each of your nearby allies gains a +2 bonus to all defenses until the end of your next turn.

### Strategist

You rely on planning, teamwork, and calm execution of orders as a commander instead of charismatic presence. Any time an element of the commander class refers to Charisma, you can replace that element with a reference to Intelligence.

In addition, you start every battle with 1 additional command point.

#### Adventurer Feat

You gain 1 additional point in a background related to military history, strategy, command, or warfare. You can use this background point to raise that background beyond the normal maximum of 5.

#### Champion Feat

When you roll a die to find out how many allies one of your commands or tactics targets, add +1 to the result.

#### Epic Feat

Once per day as a free action, you can gain a number of command points equal to your Intelligence modifier.

### Sword of Victory

When your melee attack drops a non-mook enemy to 0 hp, or drops three or more mooks, you gain 1 command point.

#### Adventurer Feat

You only have to drop 2 or more mooks instead of 3 to gain the command point.

#### Champion Feat

You gain 2 command points instead of 1 when you drop a non-mook enemy to 0 hp.

#### Epic Feat

Once per day as a quick action, you can gain command points equal to the number of icon relationship points you have with the any one icon associated with battle or victory.

### Tactician

You rely on perception, intuition, and common sense as a commander instead of charismatic presence. Any time an element of the commander class refers to Charisma, you can replace that element with a reference to Wisdom.

In addition, one battle per day, you can reroll your initiative if you don’t like the first result. You must take the re-rolled result.

#### Adventurer Feat

You gain 1 additional point in a background related to military history, strategy, command, or warfare. You can use this background point to raise that background beyond the normal maximum of 5.

#### Champion Feat

Once per day after a battle, you can gain a bonus to all recharge rolls you make for your expended tactics equal to your Wisdom modifier.

#### Epic Feat

Once per day as a free action, you can choose a tactic you don’t normally possess and use it as if you did (you don’t get any feats associated with it).
