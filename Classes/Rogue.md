## Class Features

All rogues fight better when they gain momentum, are good at stabbing enemies in the back, and have a knack for avoiding the traps that their clueless allies would stumble into.

### Momentum

Many of the rogue’s powers function only when the rogue has momentum.

You gain momentum by hitting an enemy with an attack.

You lose momentum when you are hit by an attack.

The default is that you can use momentum powers without losing momentum, but a few powers specify that you must spend your momentum to use them. You don’t have to use attacks that require momentum against the foe you hit to gain that momentum.

Momentum powers that do not require you to spend your momentum are generally classified as interrupt actions. You can only use one interrupt action a round, which keeps your momentum powers from dominating the battle.

### Sneak Attack

Once per round when you make a rogue melee weapon attack against an enemy engaged with one or more of your allies, you can deal extra damage if your attack hits.

| Rogue Level | Extra Damage |
|-------------|--------------|
| 1           | +1d4         |
| 2           | +1d6         |
| 4           | +2d6         |
| 6           | +3d6         |
| 8           | +5d6         |
| 10          | +7d6         |

#### Adventurer Feat

Your Sneak Attack feature also works the first round of combat against enemies with a lower initiative than you.

#### Champion Feat

Your Sneak Attack feature also works against enemies who are confused, dazed, stunned, vulnerable to your attack, or weakened.

#### Epic Feat

Once per battle when you miss with an attack that would have allowed you to deal Sneak Attack damage, replace the normal miss damage with your full Sneak Attack damage.

### Trap Sense

Even rogues whose backgrounds don’t have anything to do with noticing, avoiding, or disarming traps have a unique knack for dealing with traps.

If a rogue’s skill check involving a trap is a natural even failure, the rogue can reroll the skill check once. If a trap’s attack roll against a rogue is a natural odd roll, the rogue can force the trap to reroll the attack once.

#### Adventurer Feat

The trap attack reroll can also apply to a nearby ally of the rogue as the rogue shouts a warning or acts to prevent the trap from hitting.

#### Champion Feat

You gain a +3 bonus to skill check rerolls you make against traps.

#### Epic Feat

You only take half damage from trap attacks.

## Class Talents

Choose three of the following class talents.

### Cunning

You can use your Intelligence in place of your Charisma for any rogue attacks, talents, or powers that use Charisma (e.g. _shadow walk_ and _slick feint_). You also gain two extra points of backgrounds to spend on knowledge-related backgrounds and gain a +2 bonus to skill checks involving traps.

#### Adventurer Feat

You gain a +1 bonus to Mental Defense.

#### Champion Feat

Once per battle, reroll a save against an effect from an attack that originally hit your Mental Defense.

#### Epic Feat

Your once-per-battle save reroll is now once per save.

### Improved Sneak Attack

Your Sneak Attack damage is better than other rogues. Use the following Sneak Attack bonus damage progression instead.

| Rogue Level | Extra Damage |
|-------------|--------------|
| 1           | +1d6         |
| 2           | +1d8         |
| 4           | +2d8         |
| 6           | +3d8         |
| 8           | +5d8         |
| 10          | +7d8         |

#### Adventurer Feat

Once per day as a free action, you can add your Sneak Attack damage to any hit against one target that would not otherwise have qualified for the damage.

#### Champion Feat

Once per day, roll d20s for your Sneak Attack damage instead of d8s.

#### Epic Feat

One battle per day, ignore the limitation that you can use Sneak Attack damage only once per round.

### Murderous

Against staggered enemies, your crit range with rogue attacks expands by 2.

#### Adventurer Feat

You gain a +2 attack bonus against staggered enemies.

#### Champion Feat

Your crit range against staggered enemies expands by 2 (now +4).

#### Epic Feat

Whenever a staggered enemy misses you with a melee attack, it’s vulnerable to your attacks for the rest of the battle.

### Shadow Walk

You gain the _shadow walk_ at-will power:

As a move action before you have used your standard action this turn, if you are not engaged, you can make the following “attack” against all nearby enemies, targeting the enemy among them with the highest Mental Defense.

**Attack:** Charisma + Level vs. MD

**Hit:** Remove yourself from play. At the start of your next turn, return anywhere nearby that you could have moved to normally during your turn, and deal double damage with your first rogue attack that turn.

**Miss:** No effect. You can’t attempt to _shadow walk_ again until your next turn, but you still have your standard action this turn.

#### Adventurer Feat

On a miss, you can still use your move action normally (but still can’t _shadow walk_ this turn).

#### Champion Feat

Twice per day, you can reroll the rogue attack that follows your successful use of _shadow walk_.

#### Epic Feat

Twice per day, you can reappear from your _shadow walk_ in a nearby location you wouldn’t have been able to reach unimpeded physically, for instance, on the other side of a portcullis or door, or high up a wall.

### Smooth Talk

Once per day, convince your GM with an amazing line of patter while you are using social skills to speak or interact with NPCs associated with a particular icon. If the GM is convinced by your patter, roll a normal save (11+). If you succeed, for the rest of the day you can function as if you have a 2-point positive relationship with the icon who seems to be in play. Thanks to your amazing gift of gab, for a short time, it’s more or less true. (Note that these points replace any points you normally have with the icon rather than adding to them.)

Failure on the Smooth Talk save generally arouses suspicions.

#### Adventurer Feat

Add your Charisma modifier to your Smooth Talk save rolls.

#### Champion Feat

Success with your Smooth Talk talent gives you a 3-point positive relationship instead.

#### Epic Feat

Even if you fail your Smooth Talk save, you get a 2-point conflicted relationship with the icon because the people you’re speaking with can’t be sure.

### Swashbuckle

Once per battle as a quick action, you can spend your momentum to pull off a daring stunt the likes of which others could scarcely conceive. You may make an attack as part of the stunt, but you’ll need to roll normally for the attack. This is an improvisational talent.

As a swashbuckler, you do not need a difficult skill check to pull the stunt off.

### Thievery

You have the Thief background at its full possible bonus of +5, without having to spend your normal background points on it.

#### Adventurer Feat

Regardless of your level, you gain the bonus power _thief’s strike_ in addition to your normal number of powers.

#### Champion Feat

Once per day, you can deal full damage with _thief’s strike_ instead of half damage.

#### Epic Feat

Twice per level, you can steal something with a successful _thief’s strike_ that you would not be able to steal ordinarily, but that would require a bit of magic, e.g. a dream, a spell, someone’s hope, a memory. The theft probably isn’t going to be permanent, but it should last at least a day or two. You can’t steal the same thing twice.

### Tumble

You gain a +5 bonus to disengage checks. In addition, while you are moving, if an enemy moves to intercept you, you can make one disengage roll per intercepting enemy as a free action to avoid that enemy, but you must stop the first time you fail any of those disengage checks.

#### Adventurer Feat

You ignore the penalty for disengaging from more than one enemy at a time.

#### Champion Feat

One battle per day as a free action, you can declare that you’re a tumbling fool and automatically succeed on your first disengage check each turn.

#### Epic Feat

Whenever you take critical hit damage, roll a hard save (16+). If you succeed, you somehow tumbled out of the way of whatever was about to hit you, and instead only take damage equal to the attacker’s level.

## 1st Level Powers

At-Will

**Target:** One enemy

**Attack:** Dexterity + Level vs. AC

**Hit:** WEAPON + Dexterity damage, and you can pop free from the target.

### Adventurer Feat

If you drop the target with your _evasive strike_ attack, you can pop free from all enemies instead.

### Champion Feat

If you hit with _evasive strike_ and the natural attack roll was even, you gain a +2 bonus to AC and PD against the next attack that targets you this battle (no joy if it’s an attack vs. MD).

### Epic Feat

Ok. Thanks to your slippery mind, the champion feat benefit also provides a +2 bonus to MD.

### Adventurer Feat

If you score a critical hit with _flying blade_, the target is also dazed (–4 attack) until the end of your next turn.

### Champion Feat

As long as one of your allies is engaged with the target, your _flying blade_ attack rolls no longer need to be even to add your Sneak Attack damage.

**Target:** One enemy

**Attack:** Dexterity + Level vs. AC

**Hit:** WEAPON + Dexterity damage.

### Champion Feat

Missing with _sure cut_ no longer counts as a use of Sneak Attack for the round.

## Tumbling Strike

Melee attack

At-Will

Always: You gain a +5 bonus to all disengage checks you attempt this turn. You can also move to engage an enemy, make this attack against it, and then use a quick action to attempt to disengage from it (the quick action disengage lets you move again if you succeed).

Momentum power

At-Will (once per round)

Using _deflection_ no longer spends your momentum.

### Spiky Bastard

Daily

Quick action

**Effect:** You go all-out to hurt anyone who tries to get a piece of you. For the rest of the battle, while you're conscious, using at least one bladed weapon, and are not staggered or stunned, you deal 10 damage to each enemy that makes a melee attack against you and rolls a natural odd attack roll. The damage hits the enemy before their attack damages you.

#### Champion Feat

_Spiky bastard_ damage now applies when you are staggered, though obviously not while you are unconscious.

Momentum power

At-Will (once per round)

Interrupt action; you must spend your momentum

Trigger: An enemy targets you with a melee attack.

### True Targeting

Momentum power

At-Will

Interrupt action OR free action on your turn; you must spend your momentum

Trigger: An invisible or otherwise hidden enemy attacks you, or you try to attack an invisible or hidden enemy.
