(M): Indicates columns in which multiclass characters lag one level behind.

Fighter weapon attack maneuvers deal damage based on the fighter’s level. You also don’t have to keep track of upgrading a 1st level maneuver into a 3rd level maneuver, because all the maneuvers function at your level. You can change which maneuvers you know and have ready whenever you gain a level.

# Class Features

Fighters have two class features: Extra Tough and Threatening.

## Extra Tough

You start with nine recoveries instead of the usual eight.

### Adventurer Feat

Increase your total recoveries by 1.

## Threatening

Whenever an enemy attempts to disengage from you, it takes a penalty to its check equal to your Dexterity or Constitution modifier, whichever is higher.

The penalty doesn’t apply if you are stunned, grabbed, or otherwise incapable of making an opportunity attack.

### Adventurer Feat

Whenever an enemy fails to disengage from you, you also deal damage to that enemy equal to your Dexterity or Constitution modifier. At 5th level, damage is double the modifier. At 8th level, it’s triple.

### Champion Feat

Whenever a non-mook enemy fails to disengage from you, it’s vulnerable to your attacks for the rest of the battle.

# Class Talents

Choose three of the following class talents.

You get an additional fighter class talent at 6th level.

Fighters have flexible attacks called maneuvers; you roll your attack and then choose which maneuver you want the attack to use. You only get to use one maneuver with each attack, so it’s usually best to choose maneuvers with a few different triggering rolls

## Cleave

Once per battle, make a fighter melee attack as a free action after one of your melee attacks drops an enemy to 0 hp.

### Adventurer Feat

If you have your move action available, you can use it before making your Cleave attack to reach an enemy you are not already engaged with.

### Champion Feat

You can use Cleave twice each battle, but only once a round.

### Epic Feat

You gain a +4 attack bonus with your Cleave attacks.

## Comeback Strike

Once per battle as a free action, make another attack with a –2 penalty after your first fighter attack during your turn misses.

### Adventurer Feat

You no longer take the –2 penalty to your Comeback Strike attacks.

### Champion Feat

Once per day, you can use Comeback Strike twice in a battle.

### Epic Feat

You gain a +4 attack bonus with your Comeback Strike attacks.

## Counter-Attack

Once per round when the escalation die is even and an enemy misses you with a natural odd melee attack roll, you can make a basic melee attack dealing half damage against that enemy as a free action. (The attack can’t use any limited abilities or flexible attack maneuvers.)

### Adventurer Feat

Your Counter-Attack attack now deals full damage.

### Champion Feat

You can use Counter-Attack once per turn instead of once per round (in effect, you’re free to Counter-Attack once per enemy turn).

### Epic Feat

You can now use Counter-Attack when the escalation die is 3+.

## Deadeye Archer

Your attacks with d8 ranged weapons (heavy crossbow, longbow) now deal d10 damage per level. Your attacks with d6 ranged weapons (light crossbow, shortbow) now deal d8 damage per level. In addition, your misses with basic ranged attacks deal damage equal to your level.

### Adventurer Feat

If you spend a quick action to aim before making a ranged basic attack, add your Dexterity modifier to the damage if you miss.

### Champion Feat

Once per battle, expand your crit range with a fighter ranged attack by 4 (usually to 16+) for that attack. Declare you’re using this feat power before you roll the attack.

### Epic Feat

Your crit range with ranged weapon attacks expands by 1 (usually to 19+).

## Heavy Warrior

Once per battle while wearing heavy armor, when you are hit by an attack that targets AC, as a free action, you can take half damage from that attack instead.

### Adventurer Feat

Once per day, you can use Heavy Warrior twice in a battle (against different attacks).

### Champion Feat

You can also use the power against an attack that targets PD.

### Epic Feat

Once per day, you can reroll a recharge roll for a magic armor power.

  
  

## Power Attack

Once per battle before you roll an attack, you can declare you’re using Power Attack to deal additional damage with that attack roll. If the attack hits, you deal the following additional damage:

Deal 1d4 additional damage per level if you are using a one-handed weapon.

Deal 1d6 additional damage per level if you are using a two-handed weapon.

### Adventurer Feat

You deal the additional Power Attack damage even if the attack misses.

### Champion Feat

One battle per day, you can use Power Attack twice in the battle.

### Epic Feat

One-handed weapon damage using Power Attack increases to 1d6 per level; two-handed weapon damage using Power Attack increases to 1d8 per level.

## Skilled Intercept

Once per round as a free action, roll a normal save (11+) to intercept an enemy who is moving to attack one of your nearby allies. You can pop free from one enemy to move and intercept the attack. If you are engaged with more than one enemy, the others can take opportunity attacks against you.

The moving enemy makes its attack with you as a target instead. If you’re wearing heavy armor and the attack hits, you only take half damage.

### Adventurer Feat

You can pop free from up to two enemies when using Skilled Intercept.

### Champion Feat

You gain a bonus to your Skilled Intercept save equal to the escalation die.

### Epic Feat

Enemies can’t make opportunity attacks against you during your Skilled Intercept movement.
