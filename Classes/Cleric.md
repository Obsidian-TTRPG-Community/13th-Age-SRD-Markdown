#### Class Features

All clerics have the Ritual Magic class feature. They also receive a bonus spell: *heal*.

There are certain abilities specific to the cleric that can affect their powers:

-   *Cast for power* and *cast for broad effect:* The spell can be used one of two ways—either as a more powerful effect on one target (power) or as a weaker effect on multiple targets (broad). Spells cast for power cannot target the caster. Spells cast for broad effect can.
    
-   *Free recovery*: The cleric can recover hit points as if they were using a recovery (without actually spending the recovery).
    
-   *Heal using a recovery*: The character targeted with a healing effect uses one of their recoveries and rolls their own recovery dice.
    
-   *Invocation*: A quick action that offers advantages in battle. It can be made once a day. More than one cleric in a party cannot use the same invocation during a battle.
    

##### Heal

Close-quarters spell

**Special:** You can use this spell twice per battle.

Quick action to cast (1/round)

**Target:** You or one ally you are next to

**Effect:** The target can heal using a recovery.

###### Adventurer Feat

The target can now be a nearby ally instead of an ally you are next to.

###### Champion Feat

If the target of your heal spell is an ally with 0 hp or below, that ally also adds hit points equal to 1d10 x your Charisma modifier to the recovery.

###### Epic Feat

When you cast *heal* on an ally you are next to, that ally adds +30 hp to the recovery.

##### Ritual Magic

Clerics can cast their spells as rituals. (See Rituals.)

#### Class Talents

Choose three cleric talents/domains. Each talent/domain provides an ability that can be improved by feats. It also provides an invocation you can use as a quick action once per day, per battle, per party.

##### Domain: Healing

When you cast a spell that lets you or an ally heal using a recovery, the target also adds hit points equal to double your level to the recovery.

**Invocation of Healing:** This battle, you gain an additional use of the *heal* spell. The first *heal* spell you cast after using this invocation allows the target to heal using a free recovery instead of spending a recovery.

###### Adventurer Feat

When you cast a spell that allows an ally to heal using a recovery, you can let them use one of your recoveries instead. (If you also have the Protection/Community domain, any nearby ally can expend the recovery instead of you.)

###### Champion Feat

The *invocation of healing* gives you two additional uses of *heal* this battle instead of only one.

###### Epic Feat

Increase the additional hit points the target heals to triple your level.

##### Domain: Justice/Vengeance

Once per turn when an enemy scores a critical hit against you or a nearby ally, or drops you or a nearby ally to 0 hp or below, you gain an attack-reroll blessing. Immediately choose a nearby ally and give them the blessing as a free action.

An ally with this blessing can use it to reroll an attack as a free action this battle. An ally can only have one such blessing on them at a time.

**Invocation of Justice/Vengeance:** This battle, add double your level to the miss damage of your attacks and the attacks of your nearby allies. (For example, your basic melee attack as a cleric will deal triple your level as miss damage while this invocation is active.)

###### Adventurer Feat

You can take the attack-reroll blessing yourself.

###### Champion Feat

When you gain an attack-reroll blessing to distribute, you gain two blessings to distribute instead.

###### Epic Feat

Attacks rolls from your reroll blessings gain a +4 bonus.

##### Domain: Knowledge/Lore

You gain 4 additional background points that must be used somehow in relation to knowledge or lore.

**Invocation of Knowledge/Lore:** You must use this invocation during your first round of a battle. When you do, you get a quick glimpse of the battle’s future. Roll a d6; as a free action at any point after the escalation die equals the number you rolled, you can allow one of your allies to reroll a single attack roll with a +2 bonus thanks to your vision of this future.

###### Adventurer Feat

Once per day, you can change one of your skill checks involving knowledge to a natural 20 instead. Interpret the word “knowledge” as loosely as your GM allows. GMs, be generous.

###### Champion Feat

You now roll a d4 for the invocation, not a d6.

###### Epic Feat

You gain a different positive relationship point each day with a random icon, purely because the icon has realized you know something they need to know. It changes every day and it might contradict your usual icon relationships.

##### Domain: Life/Death

You and your nearby allies gain a +1 bonus to death saves.

**Invocation of Life/Death:** This battle, you and each of your allies can each separately add the escalation die to a single save made by that character. In addition, you and your allies do not die from hit point damage when your negative hit points equal half your normal hit points. Instead, you die when your negative hit points equal your full hit points.

###### Adventurer Feat

The death save bonus increases to +2.

###### Champion Feat

Each battle, the first time an ally near you becomes staggered, that ally immediately heals hit points equal to twice your level.

###### Epic Feat

Your first use of the *resurrection* spell is free, and doesn’t count against your total.

##### Domain: Love/Beauty

Once per level, you can generate a one-point conflicted relationship with a heroic or ambiguous icon you do not already have a relationship with. The relationship point remains with you until you gain a level, and then it’s time for another one-level relationship.

###### Champion Feat

You gain two points in the relationship instead.

**Invocation of Love/Beauty:** As a free action, at some dramatic moment, you or an ally of your choice can roll for one icon relationship that might have an effect on the battle. Rolls of 5 and 6 are beneficial as usual, though the GM will have to improvise what that means in the middle of combat. The invocation’s advantage does not occur the moment you roll initiative; wait for a dramatic moment instead.

##### Domain: Protection/Community

Once per battle, you can affect two additional allies when you cast a spell for broad effect.

###### Adventurer Feat

Whenever you target one or more allies with a spell, one ally of your choice can roll a save against a save ends effect.

**Invocation of Protection/Community:** This battle, critical hits against you and your nearby allies deal normal damage instead of critical damage.

##### Domain: Strength

You can wield heavy/martial weapons without an attack penalty.

###### Adventurer Feat

Once per battle, you can deal extra damage to one target you hit with a melee attack as a free action. The damage bonus is a number of d4 equal to your Strength modifier or to your level, whichever is higher.

###### Champion Feat

You can use d8s instead of d4s for the bonus damage dice.

###### Epic Feat

Once per day, you can use d20s instead of d8s for the bonus damage dice.

**Invocation of Strength:** This battle, you and your nearby allies deal triple damage instead of double damage on critical hits with melee attacks.

##### Domain: Sun/Anti-Undead

Every attack you make deals holy damage instead of other types of damage unless you choose otherwise for a specific attack.

###### Adventurer Feat

If your attack already deals holy damage, it gains the following bonus damage—adventurer tier: +1 damage; champion tier: +2 damage; epic tier: +3 damage.

###### Champion Feat

You gain a +2 bonus to all defenses against attacks by undead.

###### Epic Feat

The invocation also affects your allies’ daily spells.

**Invocation of Sun/Anti-Undead:** When you cast a daily cleric spell this battle, roll a d6. If you roll less than or equal to the escalation die, you regain the use of that daily spell after the battle.

##### Domain: Trickery/Illusion

Once per battle, as a quick action when you are engaged with an enemy, roll a d20 (your “trick die”).

As a free action before the start of your next turn, give your trick die to a nearby ally or enemy who is about to make an attack roll. The trick die result becomes the natural result of their roll instead.

###### Champion Feat

Your trick die can be used for any one d20 roll, not just an attack.

###### Epic Feat

You get another trick die roll to use each battle the first time the escalation die reaches 3+.

**Invocation of Trickery/Illusion:** This battle, attacks against you by enemies that moved to engage you during their turn miss on natural odd rolls.

##### Domain: War/Leadership

Once per turn when you make a melee attack against an enemy, hit or miss, your allies gain a +1 attack bonus against that enemy until the start of your next turn.

###### Adventurer Feat

The attack no longer has to be a melee attack, close and ranged attacks also work.

###### Champion Feat

The bonus now applies against all enemies you attack; you no longer have to single out one foe if you use a spell that attacks multiple enemies.

###### Epic Feat

Allies now also get a damage bonus against such enemies equal to double your Charisma modifier.

**Invocation of War/Leadership:** Increase the escalation die by 1.

##### Resurrection

Ranged spell

**Special:** You can cast this spell only once per level, and a limited number of times in your life. You must have most of the corpse available to cast the spell. There’s no time limit on resurrecting a dead PC, so long as you have the corpse.

**Effect:** You can bring a creature back to life in more or less normal condition, with varying levels of recovery.

**Limited Casting:** The first time in your life that you use the spell, you can cast it with a single standard action. Using the spell removes one of your spell slots until you gain a level. (You get one less spell per full heal-up.) The person you are resurrecting comes back at roughly half strength, e.g. expending half their recoveries, being dazed (save ends), and, for each ability, having a 50% chance that it is expended.

The second time in your life you cast the spell, it takes at least three or four rounds and costs you roughly half your hit points and daily powers/spells. The person you are resurrecting comes back at something like one-quarter strength.

The third time you cast the spell it has to be as a ritual. The spell chews you up and leaves you with only a few hit points, then gnaws at the person you have resurrected, who takes days to recover well enough to qualify as an adventurer or combatant.

The fourth time you cast the spell it nearly kills you. The resurrection succeeds but the person you’ve resurrected is going to be a mess for a month or more, regardless of any other magic you use.

The fifth time you resurrect someone, that’s the end of your story and you die. There’s only a 50% chance that the resurrection spell works on the target. You’ve used up your quota of resurrection magic. You’re not coming back via this spell, either.

**Limited Resurrection:** If the target of your resurrection spell has been resurrected more times than you have cast the spell, there is a 50% chance that the experience will play out using *their* higher number of resurrections instead of the number of times you have cast the spell.

9th level spell: You no longer need to have most of the corpse to perform this spell.

#### 9th Level Spells

##### Overworld Travel

Close-quarters spell

Daily

**Special:** You must cast this spell outdoors. It enables you and a group of nearby allies to travel to most any location in the world that you can name.

Travel takes between an hour and a day, depending on distance and the amount of effort the exerted.

The destination can be in the overworld or in the land. It can’t be in the underworld.

##### Prayer for Readiness

Close-quarters spell

Daily

**Targets:** Up to 5 allies

**Effect:** You utter a powerful prayer upon your comrades, giving each a special blessing. At any point later this battle, each blessed ally can acknowledge the blessing by saying “thank you” to your god, gods, or pantheon as a free action to reroll a d20 roll. That ally must take the reroll result.

Note that you are giving the blessing and don’t receive it yourself.

###### Epic Feat

This spell is now a quick action to cast.
