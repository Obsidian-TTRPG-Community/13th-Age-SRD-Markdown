### Ability Scores

Monks gain a +2 class bonus to two of: Strength, Dexterity, or Wisdom, as long one of them isn’t the same ability you increase with your +2 racial bonus.

### Backgrounds

Possible backgrounds include: holy acolyte, mountain sanctuary guardsman, traveling circus acrobat, river guide, spider-cult assassin, tunnel vermin exterminator, bodyguard, farmer, hallucinogenic mushroom farmer, wild mountain ginseng harvester, traveling tournament organizer, civil rights organizer.

### Gear

At 1st level, a monk may start with one or two weapons, a change of clothes, and perhaps a ranged weapon—or none of those.

#### Gold Pieces

Monks may start with either 25 gp or 1d6 x 10 gp.

#### Armor

| Armor Type | Base AC | Atk Penalty |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| None       | 11      | —           |
| Light      | 11      | —           |
| Heavy      | 12      | -4          |
| Shield     | 1       | -2          |

#### Melee Weapons

A monk usually fights with his hands and feet (JAB, PUNCH, and KICK), though if he has traditional weapons from his training, he can use those. When a monk fights with weapons not from his tradition, he uses the fighter’s weapon chart with a -2 atk penalty.

### Class Features

All monks have attacks dealing JAB, PUNCH, and KICK damage, use forms as the basis of their actions during each round, use ki points, and are considered to fight with two-weapons even when they’re just fighting with their fists and feet. They also can take advantage of magical bracers.

#### JAB, PUNCH, and KICK Attacks

Under normal circumstances, melee weapons that are traditional in a monk’s style function like special effects for monks. Most monk attacks are rated as JAB, PUNCH, or KICK attacks, in the same sense that most fighter attacks are WEAPON attacks.

-   JAB attacks deal 1d6 damage per level.
    
-   PUNCH attacks deal 1d8 damage per level.
    
-   KICK attacks deal 1d10 damage per level.
    

Monks don’t use weapon damage dice unless they are using a non-traditional weapon or a basic ranged attack that is not part of one of their monk forms.

When fighting barehanded, with bracers, or with traditional monk weapons, monks use damage dice based on the form they are attacking with, or PUNCH damage for basic melee attacks. While using a magic weapon, monks add the weapon’s attack and damage bonus to their attacks, and they can use that weapon’s power(s).

All monk attacks that use Dexterity as the attack stat use Strength as the ability score that determines damage.

#### Forms

When you learn a monk form, you learn all three elements of that form: an **opening attack**, **flow attack**, and **finishing attack**. Each element generally requires a standard action to use.

Your first standard action attack in a battle must be an opening. Your second attack can be a flow attack from any form you know, or it can be another opening. After you use a flow attack, your next monk attack must be a finishing attack from any form you know, or it can be another opening. (You can’t use flow attack twice in a row.) After a finishing attack you must start over with an opening on your next standard action. If you do not attack one turn, you must start over with an opening on your next standard action. This form progression applies whether you hit or miss with your attack.

As long as you use the proper element of the form (opening, flow, or finishing attack), you can use an opening, flow, or finishing attack from ANY of the forms you know.

When you use an element of a form, you gain an AC bonus until the start of your next turn. After using an opening attack you gain a +1 bonus to AC. After using a flow attack, you gain a +2 bonus to AC. After using a finishing attack, you gain a +3 bonus to AC. If _elven grace_ or some other power lets you use multiple elements of your forms in a turn, the AC bonuses don’t stack but you do get to use the highest bonus.

#### Ki

You gain a number of _ki_ points each day equal to 1 + your Wisdom modifier. You can spend ki to modify the natural result of one of your attack rolls. Ki is a daily resource. When you take a full heal-up, you regain all your ki points. You don’t regain ki during a quick rest.

After rolling an attack, you can spend 1 point of ki as a free action to change your attack’s _natural_ result by 1, unless that result is a natural 1. The change can be +1 or -1. Spending ki is a free action, but you can only spend 1 point of ki each turn.

##### Adventurer Feat

You gain 1 additional point of ki each day.

##### Champion Feat

You can spend as much ki as you like during a turn. You must spend each point of ki on a different attack roll or a different ki power.

##### Epic Feat

Work with your GM to invent a new ki power related to your one unique thing or some other aspect of your character’s story. If the ki power is too good and overshadows your other ki powers, the GM should rule that you can only use it once a day.

#### Two-Weapon Fighting

Since monks are trained to strike with all their limbs, they can always be considered to be fighting with two weapons in melee, even when they’re barehanded. The principal advantage of “two-weapon fighting” is that you get to reroll your attack when you roll a natural 2 with a melee attack, sticking with the reroll.

#### Bracers as Magic Items

Monks get magic-weapon style powers from magical bracers. In practice, a monk fighting barehanded looks to bracers for magical advantage. A monk who fights with the monastery’s traditional weapons might use bracers or a magical weapon, but a monk wearing magical bracers can’t use a magical melee weapon at the same time.

### Adventure Tier Talents

Choose three of the following adventurer-tier class talents. You get an additional monk class talent at 6th level and 9th level.

You are free to take as many of the Seven Deadly Secrets talents as you wish (up to the class limit) but you can only use one of them per battle. You can choose which one just before using it.

#### Flurry (Seven Deadly Secrets)

_If you use_ Flurry _in a battle, you can’t use any other_ Deadly Secrets _talents that battle._

You gain the following attack:

Melee attack

At-Will (once per round), when the escalation die is 3+

Quick action

**Target:** One enemy

**Attack:** Dexterity + Level vs. AC

**Hit:** JAB + Strength damage

**Miss:** —

##### Adventurer Feat

You can now use Flurry when the escalation die is 2+.

##### Champion Feat

Your Flurry attack now deals damage equal to your level on a miss.

##### Epic Feat

When the escalation die is 4+, your Flurry attack deals PUNCH + Strength damage instead of JAB + Strength.

##### Ki Power

_(A Thousand Palms)_: You must be engaged with 2 or more enemies to use this power. After making a Flurry attack, you can spend 1 point of ki to make another Flurry attack against a target you have not already attacked with Flurry this turn.

#### Greeting Fist (Seven Deadly Secrets)

_If you use_ Greeting Fist _in a battle, you can’t use any other_ Seven Deadly Secrets _talent that battle._

The first time you make a melee attack against each enemy during a battle (including the first mook of a mob), the target takes 1d8 extra damage on a hit.

2nd level monk: 2d6 extra damage.

4th level monk: 2d8 extra damage.

6th level monk: 4d6 extra damage.

8th level monk: 4d10 extra damage.

10th level monk: 6d12 extra damage.

##### _Adventurer Feat_

Once per battle when you miss with your first melee attack against an enemy, you can use Greeting Fist against that enemy later that battle.

##### _Champion Feat_

When you successfully disengage from an enemy, that enemy takes damage equal to your level. Popping free doesn’t count; the damage only applies when you use the disengage action. (This damage doesn’t count as an attack, so if you hadn’t attacked that enemy yet, you could still use Greeting Fist on it later.)

##### _Epic Feat_

Once per battle, reroll an attack that qualified for Greeting Fist damage.

##### Ki Power

_(Opening the Death Gate)_: When you deal Greeting Fist damage, you can spend 1 point of ki to double that damage (as usual, a crit would then triple that damage).

#### Temple Weapon Master (Seven Deadly Secrets)

_If you use_ Temple Weapon Master _in a battle, you can’t use any other_ Seven Deadly Secrets _talents that battle._

Once per battle while you’re fighting with a weapon or weapons associated with your monastic tradition, you can turn a natural even miss into a hit.

##### Ki Power

(_Supreme Warrior Discipline)_: When you use your Temple Weapon Master power, you can spend 1 point of ki to gain a bonus to AC equal to the _current_ escalation die until an attack against AC misses you or until the end of the battle. (The AC bonus increases or decreases as the escalation die increases or decreases.)

###### _Adventurer Feat_

The AC bonus from the ki power also applies to your PD. An attack against your PD that misses also ends the bonus.

###### _Champion Feat_

When you roll a natural 2 with a monk attack while fighting with your monastic weapons, in addition to the reroll you get from Two-Weapon Fighting, you gain a bonus to the rerolled attack equal to your Strength modifier or your Wisdom modifier.

###### _Epic Feat_

One battle per day, the damage dice of your finishing attacks increase by one size (max d12). (For example, d10s become d12s.)

#### Diamond Focus

You gain a +2 bonus to saves while you’re not staggered.

In addition, you can go one round without using a monk attack form and still maintain your place in the attack form progression. For example, if you made an opening attack last round but don’t attack this round (or with your next standard action) for any reason, even being stunned or unconscious, you can still use a flow attack with your next standard action.

##### Ki Power

_(Diamond Soul)_: When you are dazed, weakened, or stunned, you can spend 1 point of ki to make an immediate normal save (11+). If you succeed, the effect ends. If you fail, the condition affects you normally. (This power also works on effects that aren’t save ends. It also breaks the stunned rule by letting you use a free action to spend ki.)

###### Adventurer Feat

You can also use the ki power to save when you’re confused or hampered.

###### Champion Feat

The ki power save is now an easy save (6+).

###### Epic Feat

You can also use the ki power to save against a last gasp effect (but it doesn’t count against your total if you fail).

#### Heaven’s Arrow

Unlike other monks, you have no attack penalty with ranged weapons, including thrown weapons, longbows, shortbows, and crossbows. Your basic ranged attacks also deal miss damage equal to your level.

Once per battle when you would make a melee attack as an element of one of your monk forms, you can use a ranged attack against a nearby enemy instead. This attack deals damage according to the JAB/PUNCH/KICK hierarchy that’s part of the form rather than WEAPON damage like basic attacks.

##### Ki Power

(_Wind from Heaven_): You can spend 1 point of ki to regain your Heaven’s Arrow power when it’s expended.

###### Adventurer Feat

You can now target enemies that are faraway when you use the Heaven’s Arrow power. The ranged weapon you’re using might have an attack penalty against faraway enemies, but your attack otherwise functions as normal.

###### Champion Feat

You can now use the Heaven’s Arrow power twice per battle.

###### Epic Feat

You no longer take opportunity attacks when you make ranged attacks while engaged.

#### Leaf on Wind

Once per battle when you use a move action, you can take another move action as a free action.

In addition, if you fall with a wall, tree, or other physical object next to you, you can fall up to 30 feet per level without taking damage. (You slap the surface, catch handholds, and use other maneuvers to slow your descent.)

##### Ki Power

_(Wind’s Comrade)_: You can spend 1 point of ki during your turn to gain _flight_ until the end of your turn.

###### Adventurer Feat

You gain a +3 bonus to disengage checks.

###### Champion Feat

When an enemy makes an attack against you that targets more than one creature, you only take half damage from that attack, hit or miss.

###### Epic Feat

Roll a normal save at the end of any turn in which you use the ki power. If you succeed, your _flight_ lasts until the end of your next turn. (It’s not advisable to count on this working by staying in midair, though you could of course fly next to a wall, counting on your ability to slow your fall as outlined above!)

#### Overworld Lineage, aka Phoenix-touched

If you wish, any time an element of the monk class refers to Wisdom, you can replace that element with a reference to Charisma.

In addition, while you’re staggered, when you roll a natural even attack roll, you heal damage equal to your Strength modifier or your Wisdom modifier (double that modifier at 5th level; triple it at 8th level).

##### Ki Power

(_Imperial Phoenix Flare_): Once per day when you are staggered, you can spend 1 point of ki to heal using a recovery. You heal half the hit points you roll for the recovery, and one enemy engaged with you of your choice takes the other half in fire damage.

###### Adventurer Feat

You can now use this ki power twice per day.

###### Champion Feat

Once per day after rolling a death save, you can gain +4 bonus to the roll.

###### Epic Feat

The first time you die after taking this feat, you are resurrected at a place of power like your home monastery or other sanctum between one and four days later, assuming another resurrection doesn’t find you first. (This counts against your normal resurrection limit, as normal.)

#### Spinning Willow Style

When a ranged attack or close-quarters attack that targets AC hits you, you can roll a normal save. If you succeed, you take only half damage from the attack.

##### Adventurer Feat

You can now use Spinning Willow Style to save against ranged attacks and close-quarter attacks that target PD.

##### Champion Feat

If you roll a natural 18+ on the save, you instead take no damage from the attack and can choose one nearby enemy. It takes one-quarter of the damage as you deflect the attack.

##### Epic Feat

Spinning Willow Style saves are now easy saves (6+).

##### Ki Power

(_The Willow Bends)_: You can spend 1 point of ki to turn a failed Spinning Willow Style save into a success.

### Champion Tier Talents

At 6th level, you gain an additional monk class talent. You can choose to take another adventurer-tier talent, or select from the talents that follow.

#### Disciple of the Hidden Flame

When you gain this talent, choose a class: cleric, sorcerer, or wizard. Each time you take a full heal-up, choose a non-feature spell of your level or lower from that class. You can’t choose the same spell twice in a row; you must choose a different option each time you take a full heal-up.

If the spell is at-will, you can cast it in place of a flow attack. If the spell is limited use, you can cast it in place of a finishing attacks. Use your Wisdom as the ability score that determines attack and damage with the spell.

##### Ki Power

(_Gather the Flame)_: You can spend 1 point of ki when you cast your Disciple of the Hidden Flame spell to cast it as if you possessed the adventurer-tier and champion-tier feat for that spell, if any. At 8th level, treat the spell like you possessed the epic-tier feat for it, if any, when you spend the ki.

#### Improbable Stunt

Once per battle as a quick action, you can pull off an outrageous improvisational stunt that no one else could manage, with the possible exception of a swashbuckling rogue! The stunt is not itself an attack but it might lead to one.

The outrageous action of your stunt isn’t something you have to roll for, even if it would ordinarily require a skill check to pull off, though you’ll still have to roll for an attack that follows up your stunt.

##### Ki Power

(_Ludicrous Improbability Maneuver)_: You can spend 1 ki point to use Improbable Stunt again this battle.

#### Path of the Perfect Warrior

One battle per day, you can increase your JAB damage dice to d8s, your PUNCH damage dice to d10s, and your KICK damage dice to d12s.

##### Ki Power

(_Perfect Breath)_: Once per day when you are healing using a recovery, you can spend 1 point of ki to heal using a second recovery as well. The second recovery is a free.

### Epic Tier Talents

At 9th level, you gain an additional monk class talent. As usual, you can choose a talent from a lower tier, or an epic tier. Epic-tier talents have feats but no associated ki powers.

#### Abundant Step

Once per battle when the escalation die is 1+, you can teleport to a nearby location you can see as a move action.

##### Epic Feat

You can now teleport to a faraway location you can see.

#### Champion of Three Worlds

When you make a finishing attack, roll an additional d20 (usually two) for the attack roll. Use the result of your choice.

##### Epic Feat

Once per battle when you make a flow attack, you can roll an additional d20 for the attack roll.

#### Procession of the Sun and Moon

Once per level, while meditating during a quick rest, you can decide that it’s time for the start of a new day. You and each of your willing allies can make a hard save (16+). Each character who succeeds regains all spells, powers, hit points, ki, and recoveries as if they had taken a full heal-up and started a new day.

The only character element that does not reset as if it was a new day are your icon relationship rolls and any icon relationships.

##### Epic Feat

You and each of your allies gain a bonus to the save equal to your Strength modifier or your Wisdom modifier.
