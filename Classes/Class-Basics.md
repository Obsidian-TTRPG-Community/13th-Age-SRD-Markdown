## Class Basics

### Weapon Damage Progression

The basic rule for PC weapon damage is that a character deals 1 die of weapon damage per [class](../Character-Rules/Class.md) level, plus their ability modifier (or double the modifier at 5th level, and triple it at 8th level).

See Weapons for more on weapon damage rules.

### Spell Progression

Most of the spells used by characters have higher-level versions. Those versions allow you to choose the spell as a higher-level option if you like, rather than choosing an all-new spell. You do not automatically gain access to the higher-level effects of a spell when you level up just because you have a lower-level version of it.

Higher-level spells have higher damage amounts than their lower-level counterparts, but these amounts and effects are not cumulative. Amounts from the highest level spell you have are used. New effects from higher level spells are added to the spell’s original effects.

### Shifting Choices During an Adventure

These are guidelines for allowing PCs to change their chosen spells, powers, talents, and [feats](../Character-Rules/Feats/Feats.md) during gameplay, subject to how forgiving you and your fellow players are.

#### Talents

Talents are a core element of your character. If you’re going to rearrange your talents, something extremely significant needs to have happened in your character’s story, some personal transformation or revelation. It is a sign of character transformation, usually coinciding with shifts in [icon relationships](../Character-Rules/Icon-Relationships.md).

#### Spells

You can change the spells you can cast after each full heal-up.

#### Powers

You can reselect your power choices when you gain a level.

#### Feats

If you’ve made changes to spells and powers, revise your feats appropriately. If the changes make sense for the character’s story and the GM agrees, play them.

#### Incremental Advances

You can gain a higher-level power or spell from an incremental advance. If you opt to raise an existing spell to a higher level, you can replace its lower-level spot with a new lower-level spell. If you swap out lower-level spell for a higher-level spell, you can’t replace a spell or power you have already expended.

[^1]: The base AC numbers assume that the PC is in the armor that suits  
write-ups for details. PCs who know how to fight using a shield get +1 AC when they have a shield in one hand.
[^2]: Various druid talents will change these stats.
