# Magic Items
    

There are two types of magic item. True magic items are permanent magic items used as loot during adventures and rewards for success. One-use items (mainly potions, oils, and runes) are magical treasure on which to spend hard-won gold. (See Loot: Treasure Rewards for notes on the wealth successful characters earn each adventure.)
