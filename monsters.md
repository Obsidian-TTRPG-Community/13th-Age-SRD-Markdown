# Monsters

You can use the monsters included in the *13<sup>th</sup> Age* Archmage
Engine, or you can make your own.

## Monster Rules

### Stats & Characteristics

Most monster attacks generally deal a specific amount of damage (instead
of rolling for damage) and don’t add on the escalation die. Only
exceptional monsters get to add the escalation die to their attacks.

Monsters may have particular abilities or powers that are triggered when
the attack roll is greater than a certain threshold. The default trigger
happens at a 16+ monster d20 attack roll, though unpredictable monsters
may have effects trigger on other rolls.

#### Mooks

Mooks are weaker monsters that can be cut down in large numbers in a
single turn. Damage is not tracked against single mooks, but against the
entire mob of mooks you’re facing. If you roll damage against a mook and
it is greater than the single mook’s hit points, then another mook takes
the remainder. In this way, damage can cascade to multiple mooks, and a
player can kill multiple in one turn, even if they’re not all directly
within your attack range.

A mook’s hit point value is one-fifth that of a regular monster.

Mooks move and attack individually. Mooks deal a fixed damage when they
hit, and double damage when they roll a natural 20.

Mooks can be split up into multiple mobs with different initiative
numbers and hit point pools for each.

#### Large & Huge Monsters

Large monsters generally have twice the hit points and deal roughly
double the damage of a normal-sized monster. They also count as two
monsters when you build a battle.

Huge monsters have triple the hit points, deal triple damage, and count
as three normal-sized monsters when you’re putting together a battle.

Regular-sized monsters may also have the same stats as large and huge
monsters, in which case they are labeled as double-strength and
triple-strength monsters, respectively.

#### Dire Animals

Dire animals are bigger (large-sized) versions of normal animals. Dire
animals usually have at least one dire feature, determined randomly
using the table below.

| d6  | Dire Feature      | Description                                                                                                                                   |
|-----|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Armor plates      | Add +2 to the dire animal’s AC, and add +1 to its PD.                                                                                         |
| 2   | Spiky bits        | Whenever an enemy hits the dire animal with a melee attack, deal damage equal to twice the animal’s level to that attacker.                   |
| 3   | Carnage           | The dire animal’s attacks that miss deal damage equal to its level. When staggered, its missed attacks deal damage equal to double its level. |
| 4   | Poison            | The dire animal’s main attack also deals 5 ongoing poison damage per tier (5 ongoing poison at levels 1–4, 10 at 5–7, etc.).                  |
| 5   | Dire regeneration | When the escalation die is even, this animal heals damage equal to triple its level at the start of its turn.                                 |
| 6   | Fury              | While staggered, the dire animal gains a +2 attack bonus and deals +4 damage, but at the end of each of its turns it takes 2d6 damage.        |

### Abilities

Monsters may have special abilities for use in battle.

#### Burrowing

Burrowing is a special rule for monsters that allows somewhat restricted
movement underground. Unless otherwise specified, monsters generally do
not leave functional tunnels behind them when burrowing.

A burrowing creature on the surface may attempt to burrow underground by
using a standard action. Burrowing is successful if a saving throw beats
the required save for the type of ground.

| Type of Ground                | Difficulty  | Save Needed |
|-------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Sand, dirt, forest soil       | Easy        | 6+          |
| Hard-packed dirt, loose rocks | Normal save | 11+         |
| Rock, caves, dungeon floors   | Hard save   | 16+         |

After successfully burrowing, a creature may move underground, faster or
slower depending on the hardness of the ground, out of sight of other
creatures, hidden and safe from attacks.

For breaking through to the surface, the sequence is as follows: a move
action from deeper under the ground to come close to the surface, close
enough that people see there’s something coming, followed by a quick
action to break through, and then by a standard action attack.

#### Death Attacks and Last Gasp Saves

Some deadly monsters have a special attack called a *death attack* that
can kill (petrify, paralyze, liquefy, immolate) in a single attack. Such
attacks offer the player a *last gasp save*.

A player that is affected by a death attack has a limited amount of last
gasp saves to try to throw off the condition of the death attack. On the
first turn a player is affected, the player may make a single action
(standard, move, or quick), after which they must roll a hard save
(16+). If successful, the player shrugs off the death attack condition
and can act normally on their next turn. If unsuccessful, their turn
ends and the player is now helpless and cannot take any other actions on
future turns except for further last gasp saves. Each successive last
gasp save is a hard save (16+). A successful save means that the player
can act normally on the next round, unless the player rolls a natural 20
for their last gasp save, which means that the player can take their
turn normally in the current round.

Once a player fails four last gasp saves while fighting off the death
attack, the death attack effect succeeds, and the player is adversely
affected as the attack indicates.

An ally may assist a player affected by a death attack. The ally must
use a standard action to help the player shake off the attack. This
gives the player a free last gasp save that may be rolled immediately.
(A failure doesn’t count against the four allowed saves.) In addition,
the assisted save becomes normal difficulty (11+) instead of hard.

#### Fear

Some monsters may have an aura of fear that makes them more difficult to
be attacked.

A character engaged with such a monster must have a certain amount of
hit points (according to the level of the monster with the fear aura) or
be dazed (-4 attack) and gain no benefit from the escalation die.

| Level | Fear threshold (HP) |
|-------|---------------------|
| 0     | 7                   |
| 1     | 9                   |
| 2     | 12                  |
| 3     | 15                  |
| 4     | 18                  |
| 5     | 24                  |
| 6     | 30                  |
| 7     | 36                  |
| 8     | 48                  |
| 9     | 60                  |
| 10    | 72                  |
| 11    | 96                  |
| 12    | 120                 |
| 13    | 144                 |
| 14    | 192                 |

Should the character’s hp increase past the fear threshold or the
character disengage from the monster, they lose the dazed effect and
regain the escalation die benefits.

### Group Abilities

A few monsters have limited abilities that can be used a certain number
of times in a battle for the group. Any monster within that group may
use the ability, but then the number of available uses is decremented
for the entire group. It does not matter which monster uses the ability.

Mooks cannot have group abilities.

### Leveling Up

Use these guidelines to raise an existing monster by one or more levels.

1.  Raise its attack bonuses and defenses by 1 per added level.

2.  For damage, hp, and related special abilities (like healing),
    multiply the monster’s stats accordingly:

| Levels Added | Damage Multiplier |
|--------------|-------------------|
| +1 level     | x 1.25            |
| +2 levels    | x 1.6             |
| +3 levels    | x 2.0             |
| +4 levels    | x 2.5             |
| +5 levels    | x 3.2             |
| +6 levels    | x 4.0             |

### Size/Strength and Level

These are the key stats that determine how tough a battle will be using
the creature. Sizes are regular, large, and huge. Regular-sized monster
can have double-strength (2x) and triple-strength (3x). Regular-sized
and regular-strength monsters are labeled as normal.

### Role

Monsters with different roles still use the same stats.

#### Archers

Archers are ranged attackers who use weapons rather than spells.

#### Blockers

Blockers have abilities that help them protect their allies.

#### Casters

Casters are magician-types who need space to cast their spells properly.
They’re capable of anything.

#### Leaders

Leaders have abilities that help other monster allies fight better.

#### Mooks

Mooks are minor monsters that are good cannon fodder. (See Mooks.)

#### Spoilers

Spoilers mess the PCs up with attacks that inflict harmful effects
instead of or in addition to hit point damage.

#### Troops

Troops are the default monster type that aim to hurt PCs via hit point
damage.

#### Wreckers

Wreckers really bring the pain. Enemy groups containing only wreckers
will be very dangerous to the PCs.

### Type

Some spells and magic items care about monster type. A ranger with a
favored enemy type definitely cares about it.

Types include aberration, beast, construct, demon, dragon, giant,
humanoid, ooze, and undead.

### Initiative, AC, PD, MD, HP

See Combat Stats.

### Attack

The default attack is a melee attack against one target that requires a
standard action to use. If an attack can target more than one creature,
that information follows the attack value.

When a monster makes an opportunity attack, it must use a melee attack.
If that attack action normally includes multiple attacks, it can make
only one attack roll.

The abbreviation **R:** indicates that an attack is a ranged attack
instead of a melee attack. The default ranged attack assumes a single
nearby target, but some can hit faraway targets as well, which is noted
in the targeting information or extra effect trigger.

The abbreviation **C:** refers to close-quarters attacks that can be
used without triggering opportunity attacks from engaged enemies like
ranged attacks do. Each close-quarters attack will note its targets.

Some attacks can only be used when the natural roll triggers it. These
attacks have a *\[Special trigger\]* indicator at the start of the
attack line. Other triggers allow a monster to use a normal standard
action attack as a free action.

### Extra Effect Trigger

Many monster abilities trigger randomly based on the monster’s attack
roll. Not all attacks have triggers. Most extra effect triggers are
natural even or odd attack rolls or other specific die rolls, but a few
are more unusual.

### Specials

These are other attacks and special abilities like *fear* or movement
abilities like *flight*. Not all monsters have them.

Some monsters have nastier special abilities that increase a monster’s
options and help keep monsters interesting throughout the campaign. Use
them as options whenever you like.
























## Monster Creation

### Initiative

Establish a monster’s initiative bonus by adding its level to a modifier
between –1 and +9.

| +2       | Average                       | hellhound, human thug  |
| +3       | Just above average            | derro sage             |

### Attack Bonus

Add or subtract 1 to adjust how accurate a monster is.

### Strike Damage

Orient yourself around the average damage for a monster’s attack at any
given level. When it comes to large (or double-strength) or huge (or
triple-strength) monsters, you don’t have to put all their damage into
one strike. Split damage up into smaller attacks or use conditional
follow-up attacks.

### HP & AC

Use the defense numbers as the top-end rather than the baseline unless
you want the difficulty to scale up.

### Better Defense/Lesser Defense

Make either PD or MD better than the other, in general.

### Fear Threshold

If the monster has a fear ability, it’s the number of hit points where
creatures are dazed (–4 attack) while engaged with the monster and can’t
use the escalation die. It’s based on level, so that higher-level
monsters are more fearsome.

### Stat Adjustments

Ad hoc adjustments work fine when limited to adjustments of 1 or 2
points. If you raise a couple scores, drop a couple others.

- Scrapper: Sharp but thin: attacks +1 to +3, hp –10% to –30%

- Offensive: Soft but strong: defenses –1 to –3, attacks +1 to +3

- Oaf: Tough but clumsy: AC +1 to +3, attacks –1 to –3

- Defensive: Tough but weak: AC +1 to +3, hp –10% to –30%

- Lunk: Big and squishy: hp +15% to +40%, defenses –1 to –3

- Brittle: Tough but thin: +1 to +3 AC, hp –10% to –30%

If you want to add a full level to a monster…

- …and you only want to boost its attack: Give the monster a +6 attack
  boost.

- …and you only want to boost AC: Give the monster a +6 AC boost.

- …and you only want to increase the monster’s hit points: Double the
  monster’s hit points.

- …and you only want to increase the damage the monster deals: Add a
  second attack or ongoing damage.

- …and you only want to increase every stat: Add +1 to attack, +1 to all
  defenses, multiply its damage output by 1.25, and multiply its hit
  points by 1.25.

### Powers to Avoid

Avoid defensive powers that make it harder for the monsters to be killed
unless there’s an offense to unlock the defense.

## Underkrakens

While not monsters in and of themselves, underkrakens are enormous,
city-sized dungeons in which monsters (like soul flensers) abide. They
may be alive, or they may be complex vehicles, or colonies from another
dimension or unknown portion of the world.
