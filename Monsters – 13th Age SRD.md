## Animal/Critter

Dire animals are bigger and nastier versions of normal animals. Large-sized dire animals usually have at least on dire feature, determined randomly on the table below. As a nastier special, the GM can give a particular dire animal two dire features.

| d6 | Feature | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Armor plates | Add +2 to the dire animal’s AC, and add +1 to its PD. |
| 2 | Spiky bits | Whenever an enemy hits the dire animal with a melee attack, deal damage equal to twice the animal’s level to that attacker. |
| 3 | Carnage | The dire animal’s attacks that miss deal damage equal to its level. When staggered, its missed attacks deal damage equal to double its level. |
| 4 | Poison | The dire animal’s main attack also deals 5 ongoing poison damage per tier (5 ongoing poison at levels 1–4, 10 at 5–7 etc.). |
| 5 | Dire regeneration | When the escalation die is even, this animal heals damage equal to triple its level at the start of its turn. |
| 6 | Fury | While staggered, the dire animal gains a +2 attack bonus and deals +4 damage, but at the end of each of its turns it takes 2d6 damage. |

## Azer

Each time an attack hits an azer during the battle, the lava pool becomes more agitated. After every three attacks that hit any azers in the battle, the pool makes a _lava shot_ attack as a free action. The pool is full of molten rock but not actually a monster, so it can’t be killed normally. There might be other ways to cool it down though. Anyone who ends up in the lava takes 4d8 fire damage per round until they leave the pool.

**Lava shot +9 vs. PD (one random nearby enemy of the azers)** — 10 fire damage, and 10 ongoing fire damage  
 _Miss:_ 5 fire damage, and 5 ongoing fire damage.

## Bat

All bats have the following abilities:

-   Echolocation: Bats rely on sound waves to sense their surroundings. A bat can “see” in total darkness, and can detect creatures using invisibility or visual illusions to hide.
-   Flight: Small bats fly quickly and turn easily. Bigger bats fly more awkwardly.
-   Wall-crawler: A bat can climb on ceilings and walls as easily as it moves on the ground.

## Couatl

In addition to their standard abilities, all elder couatls and some 8<sup>th</sup> level couatls have another ability or attack (sometimes even two) that flows from the power of the icon or icons they are presently associated with. Memory keeper couatls who are associated with icons that no longer exist should be given whichever ability or attack that seems right. Alternatively, make up a new ability/attack that suits the former icon you’ve created.

## Demon

Demons may or may not have a special demonic ability. Roll 1d10 for each non-mook normal-sized demon. If you roll less than or equal to the demon’s level, it has a random ability. Large or huge (or double- or triple-strength) demons automatically get one at least one random ability.

When a demon has an ability, roll a d6 or d8 (GM’s choice) on the table below to determine what it is.

| d6 or d8 | Demonic Ability | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | True seeing | The demon is immune to invisibility and ignores any illusions. |
| 2 | Resist fire 18+ | You’ll see that the demon resists fire the first time you use fire against it. |
| 3 | Invisibility | The first time the demon is staggered each battle it becomes invisible until the end of its next turn. |
| 4 | Resist energy 12+ | The demon’s resistance to all energy types puts a damper on enemy spellcasters, but at least the resistance is only 12+. |
| 5 | Fear aura | Enemies engaged with the demon who are below its fear hit point threshold are dazed and can’t use the escalation die. See Fear. |

## Devil

Although devils vary between campaigns, they need to retain certain key elements. Devils:

-   Come from somewhere unearthly.
-   Embody evil.
-   Act through stealth, calculation, and guile.
-   Covertly interfere in mortal affairs.
-   Respect power and hierarchy—theirs, if no one else’s.
-   Are clearly distinguishable from demons.
-   Have horns.

Devils have a unique ability called _devil’s dues_. Player characters that attack a devil don’t automatically get to use the escalation die. If you want to add the escalation die to your attack, you have to decide before rolling the attack to give the devil its due. Each type of devil (except for those with the weakling ability) will specify what it gets when you give it its due. Note that an attack that targets more than one devil would require multiple devil’s due decisions and trade-offs.

Devils have other special abilities that can be picked randomly or purposely. Choose 0 to 2 abilities per devil. Some abilities may be conditional. For example, a devil may only get a special ability while a boss devil is commanding them.

<table><tbody><tr><td><b>d10</b></td><td><b>Devil Ability</b></td><td><b>Description</b></td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Alternative element</td><td>Change the <i>resist fire 13+</i> ability to a different element, e.g. lightning or acid.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Beast form</td><td>This rare special ability lets a devil pass unnoticed through populated areas, though with a tell-tale sign that it’s preternatural, such as a big cat that looks normal except for its forked tongue. Changing forms is a move action.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Devilish resilience</td><td>The devil gains a +4 bonus to saves.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Fear</td><td>The devil gains fear aura. Players with fewer hit points than double the devil’s current hit points are dazed. They cannot use the escalation die.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Final-gasp strike</td><td>When the devil drops to 0 hp, it stays up until its turn, at which point it can take one last standard action before dropping. The devil will drop without getting that last action if it takes enough damage to reduce its hit points to negative 25% of its starting hp.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Humanoid form</td><td>This rare special ability lets the heroes meet a pit fiend over dinner and not know it until too late. Changing forms is usually a move action.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Resist non-damage effects</td><td>The devil resists the effects (but not the damage) of attacks with a natural attack roll of 12 or less. Ongoing damage isn’t affected by this ability. If the attack deals energy damage that the devil is resistant to (like fire), that damage is halved as normal. This ability is tied to a devil’s energy resistance number, so if you increase that number for a devil with this ability, the non-damage range also increases.</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Summon other devils</td><td>This ability is better used as a conditional feature of a particular battle than as a standard special ability. On the first round of battle, a group of devils keens eerily, and everyone knows they’re summoning something, but no one knows exactly what, or when it will show up.</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>True seeing, see invisible</td><td>Powerful devils might have the ability to see through simple ruses and illusions.</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Unearthly toughness</td><td>If a devil takes X damage or less, negate that damage. Bigger blows have full effect, but petty blows are beneath the devil’s notice. Set X at the devil’s level + 1. It will be immune to normal miss damage from enemies that are its level or lower. Or set X at 5% of its starting hit points to have the value scale up faster at higher levels.</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Fury Devil (Erinyes)

Hellbent

Fury devils become hellbent against a creature for story reasons outside the scope of a single battle. PCs could give devils ample reason to hate them. Or a succession of 5s as relationship dice with icon interactions that involve the devils might suffice to make the fury devil hellbent. More often than not, it won’t be one of the PCs who is the target, but getting in the way of hellbent furies is a problem. They will try to bypass defenders, however, to concentrate on killing their target or targets.

Typically, a single fury devil leaves the Pit to exact retribution. If heroes manage to beat that erinyes back, then three new fury devils rise up to try to finish the mission that the first one failed at, and whoever killed the first erinyes is on their hit list, too. If those devils fail, five erinyes come next, with another hero added to their list. If stout-hearted heroes defeat all five fury devils, they’re safe. Maybe.

## Devil, Fang

Fang Devil is a singular river creature. The first time the heroes encounter the devil, it should be a 7<sup>th</sup> level monster. If the PCs slay the devil near water, you may foreshadow that the devil will be back as a multiplicity of 10<sup>th</sup> level river devils. In 13<sup>th</sup> Age, threats don’t necessarily die the first time you deal with them. In the case of Fang Devil, it’s a localized threat within one river at a time at 7<sup>th</sup> level. When it becomes a multiplying group of 10<sup>th</sup> level creatures, it could spread out wherever the campaign requires it.

## Dragon, Chromatic

**Standard dragon abilities:** All dragons have the following two abilities:

_Escalator:_ A dragon adds the escalation die to its attack rolls.

_Flight:_ A dragon flies reasonably well, powerful and fast in a straight line though not as maneuverable as more agile fliers.

**Breath attack:** Dragons have a breath attack. Unlike most close attacks that target a number of enemies, dragon breath attacks don’t care about whether the targets are in a group.

**Size:** Young dragons are medium-sized, adult dragons are usually large-sized. Huge dragons are either prodigies of power or ancient beings, having outgrown their vulnerabilities of weaker dragons.

**Personalities:** All dragons have distinct personalities. A few have unique features. They are smart enough not to fight to their own death.

**Random dragon abilities:** Dragons may have random abilities. For GMs who are uncertain whether a medium dragon should have a random ability, roll a d8. Otherwise, roll a d12. If the roll is less than or equal to the dragon’s level, it gets a random ability according to the table below. Some huge dragons have two abilities. If you want to give the dragon a chance of having one of the abilities that has campaign implications, add +2 to the roll.

| d8, d12, or d12 + 2 | Chromatic Dragon Ability | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | True seeing | The dragon is immune to invisibility and ignores any illusions. |
| 2 | Whipping tail | When an enemy engaged with the dragon rolls a natural 1 or 2 with an attack roll, the dragon can make an opportunity attack against that creature as a free action. The attack is set up by the dragon’s whipping tail but delivered by the dragon’s usual melee attack. |
| 3 | Tough Hide | The dragon has a +1 bonus to AC. |
| 4 | Twisted Mind | The dragon has a +2 bonus to MD. |
| 5 | Nimble | The dragon has a +2 bonus to PD. |
| 6 | No vulnerability | Unlike other dragons of its color, this dragon has no vulnerability. The PCs will figure that out the first time they try to use its supposed vulnerability against it. |
| 7 | Now I’m mad! | The first time the dragon is staggered each battle, it uses its _breath weapon_ attack as a free action that does not count against the normal uses of its breath. |
| 8 | Serious threat | Disengage checks against the dragon take a –5 penalty. When a creature fails to disengage from the dragon, it takes damage equal to double the dragon’s level. |
| 9 | PC-style racial power | The dragon has one of the racial powers of a player character race. The most common expressions per color are: white (halfling); black (halfling, half-orc, human, wood elf); green (dwarf, dark elf); blue (high elf, half-orc); red (half-orc, human, wood elf). |
| 10 | Raw power | Until it is staggered, the dragon rolls 2d20 with its melee attacks and uses the higher roll. |
| 11 | Damage aura | When an enemy starts its turn engaged with the dragon, it takes damage equal to the dragon’s level (adventurer tier), double the level (champion tier), or triple the level (epic tier). The damage type is the same as the dragon’s breath weapon. |
| 12 | More breath | The dragon can use its _intermittent breath_ 1d4 more times each battle. If its breath weapon isn’t intermittent (white and green dragons), the dragon gains the extra uses anyway, making it more dangerous than lesser specimens of its color. |
| 13 | Humanoid form | The dragon is capable of shapechanging into a humanoid form, usually of a warrior or spellcaster appropriate to its nature and usually not obviously draconic, registering as a normal humanoid. The dragon has the PC-style racial power of their humanoid form, but only while in shapechanged form. |
| 14 | Some Unique Thing | The dragon has an entirely unique characteristic, something akin to a player character’s one unique thing except that the dragon’s version may be relevant to combat. GM, if you don’t feel like making something up, choose an ability from the list above. |

Before battle, if the PCs are able to see the hoard while the dragon speaks to them, each PC that can hear the dragon must roll a Wisdom check. On a result of 24 or less, that PC is charmed as per the <i>charm person</i> spell and considers the dragon a friend. On a result of 25–29, the PC is lulled by the dragon’s words and the sight of the hoard; if combat occurs, the PC will be stunned during their first round. The dragon will make a suggestion to charmed PCs to leave and bring it more treasure for its hoard (while it prepares surprises for their return). Charmed PCs won’t attack the dragon, but can make a normal save each round in battle to break the charm effect (or every day outside of combat).</p></td><td><p><b>AC</b></p><p><b>(In&nbsp;Lair)</b></p><p><b>PD</b></p><p><b>MD</b></p><p><b>HP</b></p></td><td><p><b>25</b></p><p><b>26</b></p><p><b>24</b></p><p><b>18</b></p><p><b>360</b></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

## Dragon, Metallic

**Standard dragon abilities:** All dragons have the following two abilities:

_Escalator:_ A dragon adds the escalation die to its attack rolls.

_Flight:_ A dragon flies reasonably well, powerful and fast in a straight line though not as maneuverable as more agile fliers.

**Inspire awe:** Some metallic dragons inspire debilitating awe in their enemies. The _inspire awe_ ability is similar to _fear_, but it’s not fear, so its effect can combine with the dazed condition. Enemies at a hit point threshold or lower take a –4 penalty to limited attacks (attacks that aren’t basic or at-will) against the dragon — The enemy’s confidence in their own heroism/puissance is shaken.

**Variable breath weapon:** When a metallic dragon makes a _breath weapon_ attack, use the natural result of the first attack roll to determine how long the dragon must wait before it can use the breath weapon again.

| Attack roll | Recharge |
| --- | --- |
| 1–5 | The dragon can use its breath weapon again next turn. |
| 6–10 | The dragon must wait one turn before it can use its breath weapon. |
| 11+ | After waiting one turn, the dragon rolls a normal save at the start of its next turn. If it succeeds, it can use its breath weapon that turn. Otherwise it keeps rolling a save at the start of each turn until it regains its breath weapon attack. Once it uses its breath again, use the attack roll again to determine its next breath weapon attack. |

**Random dragon abilities:** Roll a d20 on the table below if you don’t feel that the story of the dragon’s abilities are already clear.

| d20 | Metallic Dragon Ability | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | True seeing | The dragon is immune to invisibility and ignores illusions. |
| 2 | Whipping tail | When an enemy engaged with the dragon rolls a natural 1 or 2 with an attack roll, the dragon can make an opportunity attack against that creature as a free action. The attack is set up by the dragon’s whipping tail but delivered by the dragon’s usual melee attack. |
| 3 | Tough hide | The dragon has +1 bonus to AC. |
| 4 | Fortress mind | The dragon has +2 bonus to MD. |
| 5 | Nimble | The dragon has +2 bonus to PD. |
| 6 | Murderous | The crit range of the dragon’s melee attacks expands by 2. |
| 7 | Now I’m mad! | The first time the dragon is staggered each battle, it uses its breath weapon attack as a free action that does not count against the normal uses of its breath. |
| 8 | Serious threat | Disengage checks against the dragon take a –5 penalty. When a creature fails to disengage from the dragon, it takes damage equal to double the dragon’s level. |
| 9 | PC-style racial power | The dragon has one of the racial powers of a player character race. If the dragon’s story suggests a specific power, choose that. Otherwise, use the most common exression per color: brass (gnome, halfling); bronze (dark elf, dwarf, half-orc, human); copper (dwarf, human, wood elf); silver (forgeborn, wood elf); gold (high elf, holy one, human, wood elf). |
| 10 | Raw power | Until it’s staggered the dragon rolls 2d20 with its melee attacks and uses the higher roll. |
| 11 | Damage aura | When an enemy starts its turn engaged with the dragon, it takes damage equal to the dragon’s level (adventurer tier), double the level (champion tier), or triple the level (epic tier). The damage type is the same as the dragon’s breath weapon. |
| 12 | More breath | The dragon gains a +5 bonus to saves to regain its breath weapon. |
| 13 | Spellbreaker | When the dragon hits a creature with an attack, one spell effect that creature created is negated (hard save ends, 16+). Once the creature saves, the effect returns. |
| 14 | Shake off | At the start of each of its turns, the dragon can roll a save against one save ends effect on it. |
| 15 | Free to flee | Like the PCs, the dragon can escape at any time by giving up what amounts for it to a campaign loss. If the PCs are the ones to benefit from this, they should experience this as a major victory. But the dragon is still out there. |
| 16 | Air supremacy | The crit range of the dragon’s attacks against flying creatures expands by an amount equal to the escalation die. |
| 17 | Denial | If a PC or other creature uses an attack against the dragon that is related to an icon that the dragon also has a relationship with, the dragon gains a +5 bonus to all defences against that attack, and it only takes damage from the attack without suffering any of its effects. |
| 18 | Survivor | Each time the dragon drops to 0 hit points, it can roll a save. The first save in a battle is easy (6+), the second normal, the third and subsequent saves are hard (16+). If it succeeds, the dragon stays conscious and takes no damage from the attack or effect that would have dropped it. |
| 19 | Humanoid form | The dragon is capable of shapechanging into a humanoid form, usually of a warrior or spellcaster appropriate to its nature and usually not obviously draconic, registering as a normal human or elf or whatever. This ability is best used for long-term dragon characters that make it worth the GM’s time to create a double- or triple-strength humanoid monster to represent the shapechanged form. The dragon has the PC-style racial power of their humanoid form, but only while in shapechaged form. Shapechanging is a move action. |
| 20 | Some unique thing | The dragon has an entirely unique characteristic, something akin to a player character’s one unique thing except that the dragon’s version may be relevant in combat. GM, if you don’t feel like making something up, choose an ability from the list above. |

## Drow

Drow may optionally include one of these abilities as nastier specials: _Drow Cruelty_ or _Poisons and Potions_.

Drow Cruelty

Choose one of the following abilities for all non-mook drow in a battle to have:

_Poisoner:_ When the drow scores a critical hit, it can forego damage to force the target to start making last gasp saves. On the fourth failure, the target falls unconscious (and can’t be woken normally) for 2d4 minutes.

_Take advantage of weakness:_ Whenever an enemy nearby a drow rolls a save, it takes its level in damage.

_Umbral caul:_ As long as at least one drow uses a standard action each round to maintain the supernatural darkness, each non-drow creature in the battle becomes dazed (save ends) whenever it rolls a natural 1–5 with an attack roll.

_Venomous:_ The first time each battle a drow hits with a weapon attack, the target also takes 5 ongoing poison damage.

Poisons and Potions

Drinking a potion, applying a poison, or using a substance requires only a quick action for a drow with one of these options. Characters who acquire any of these drow items must use a standard action to drink/apply them.

_Draft of Eschaton_ (potion): When drunk it immediately purges the body of all poisons and toxins and ends any ongoing conditions. All the drinker’s saves (including last gasp saves and death saves) automatically succeed for the rest of the battle or for five minutes. Immediately after the battle, the drinker must make a DC 30 Constitution check or be completely debilitated and unable to travel far or to fight for a day.

_Dragon Apples:_ Small ceramic spheres that explode. Make a basic ranged attack against a nearby enemy (or level + 5 for drow); on a hit, the target takes 10 ongoing fire damage.

_Midnight Tincture:_ When this glass vial is broken, the nearby area is shrouded in clinging darkness. The darkness lasts 3 rounds. Each creature in the darkness except drow takes a –4 attack penalty. The tincture can be attached to an arrow or bolt.

_Potion of Spider Climbing:_ For one battle or five minutes the drinker can climb on ceilings and walls as easily as it moves on the ground.

_Spider Venom:_ A creature hit by a melee weapon coated in the venom takes 5 ongoing poison damage when the attack roll is a natural 16+.

_Web Dust:_ Made from desiccated spiders, this dust can hold a door shut or stick an object to a wall for five minutes. Champion-tier creatures can make a DC 20 skill check to rip through something held by _web dust_ before it fully dissolves, and epic-tier creatures can rip through such objects in a round. Further applications increase the effectiveness: three applications lasts for fifteen minutes, requires 3 successful checks, and takes 3 rounds for epic-tier characters to get through.

## Ghoul

For nastier specials, instead of a slow, poisonous bite, a more deadly bite can also make things challenging for adventurers. Each time a ghoul bites a character, that PC immediately loses a recovery. If they run out of recoveries before their next full heal-up, that character must start making last gasp saves at the start of each battle. If the character fails their fourth last gasp save this way, they turn into a ghoul.

## Hag

Hags get two of the following abilities, and a single death curse.

Abilities: Choose TWO

**Adept Illusionist:** The hag gains a +5 bonus to initiative checks due to being not quite where she seems.  
 _Hag ability:_ As a distraction, the hag creates an illusion of her doing one thing, when she is in fact setting a trap. The hag throws out a bear-trap or other impediment and one nearby enemy becomes stuck (save ends). While stuck this way, the target takes 6 damage at the start of each of its turns.

**Another skin:** On the hag’s first round of combat each battle, she gains a +2 attack bonus due to her victims being shocked as she bursts out of her false outer skin.  
 _Hag ability:_ The hag coughs up a glob of liquid pseudo-flesh that globs onto a nearby enemy (no attack roll). The glob solidifies causing an effect of the hag’s choice: the target is stuck (save ends); OR the target is unable to cast spells during its next turn (the pseudo-flesh covers their mouth and face).

**Blood pact:** Each creature allied to the hag through a pact gains a +2 bonus with their first attack each battle if the hag is present.  
 _Hag ability:_ The hag spits blood in the face of the target and makes a command. The target must roll an immediate save; on a failure, as a free action it makes basic attack against an ally or against itself (target’s choice).

**Breath stealing:** The hag starts combat with 10 temporary hit points.  
 _Hag ability:_ The hag steals a recovery from the target and heals 20 hp.

**Death shriek:** When a melee attack hits the hag, she lets out a shriek as a free action and the attacker takes 2d4 thunder damage.  
 _Hag ability:_ The hag begins to shriek, and each enemy in the battle takes a –4 attack penalty with spells until the start of her next turn.

**Dusk walk:** Once per day the hag can implant a suggestion in the mind of a target sleeping within a day’s travel of her. The hag rolls an attack: **+10 vs. MD**; on a hit, she implants a suggestion in the target that they must obey when a condition she chooses is met. Suggested actions can’t cause direct harm (the target can’t be forced to fight another or harm themselves), can be no longer than 12 words, and affects the target for a week or until triggered. GM keeps the roll hidden.  
 _Hag ability:_ The hag becomes immaterial, pops free from all enemies engaged with her, and enters the land of dreams, re-appearing next to any nearby conscious creature (or a nearby or far away creature that is unconscious). The hag then makes the following attack: **C: +10 vs. MD (each nearby unconscious enemy)** — The hag implants a suggestion in the target that they must obey when they become conscious (usually “When you awake, flee this fight and discard your equipment.”) Suggested actions can’t cause direct harm. The round after the target acts on the implanted suggestion it can start rolling normal saves to throw off the effect.

**Fateful visions:** The hag uses a +2 magical weapon traded to her for her services (she gains a +2 bonus to attack and damage with melee attacks).  
 _Hag ability:_ The hag has seen this fight in a vision. Her crit range expands by 2 until the end of the battle. Each increase is cumulative.

**Foul-touched:** When an enemy is battling the hag, at the start of each of its turns, it takes 2d6 psychic damage from the horror of the hag’s visage unless it takes precautions to avoid directly glancing at her terrible face (mirror, blindfold, etc., which might cause attack penalties).  
 _Hag ability:_ The hag chooses a nearby enemy and glares at it. That target must roll an immediate save; on a failure, the target is stricken blind by her ugliness. While blinded this way, the target is hampered, weakened, and can’t make ranged attacks. The target can end the effect by splashing liquid into their eyes or using a similar act to clear the ugly out as a standard action.

**Song of dreams:** Enemies take a –4 penalty to their initiative rolls in battles with the hag.  
 _Hag ability:_ The hag begins to sing and the two enemies closest to her (even if far away) must roll an immediate save; on a failure, the target is dazed (save ends). If the dazed target fails its first save, instead it’s weakened (save ends). If the weakened target fails its second save, instead it’s helpless (save ends).

**Thief of mist:** The hag ignores opportunity attacks and can’t be intercepted while moving.  
 _Hag ability:_ The hag becomes a mist until the start of her next turn. While a mist, only spells cast with a +3 implement and attacks using a +3 magical weapon can harm her. (Some special story item might also allow attacks to hit if no PC has a +3 item.)

**Twist the path:** Once per day the hag can enspell an area to attract visitors, causing those traveling nearby to get lost and wander to that location. Alternately, the hag can cause the location to repel visitors. Finding the correct path to that location requires a DC 20 check if it is a familiar place, a DC 25 check if the travelers only have a map or guide, or a DC 30 check if the travelers are unfamiliar with the area.  
 _Hag ability:_ The target is also confused (easy save ends, 6+).

**Weakening touch:** Each enemy fighting the hag must roll a normal save at the start of the battle; on a failure, that creature starts the battle weakened (easy save ends, 6+).  
 _Hag ability:_ The target is dazed (save ends). If the dazed target fails its first save, instead it’s weakened (save ends). When the target saves against this effect, it takes a –2 attack penalty until the end of its next turn.

**Winter breath:** The hag’s attacks deal cold damage.  
 _Hag ability:_ The target takes 6 ongoing cold damage.

Death Curses: Create ONE

When a hag dies she curses the one who killed her. The only known way to remove the curse is to seek the aid of another hag, though there may be some ways to end such a curse that are not readily known.

Create one curse per hag. A good curse makes life horribly weird for a character, but isn’t something that debilitates them. Avoid ones that blind, deafen, cripple, or mute characters. Odd habits, ugly features, unusual smells, strange and disgusting diets — all these are good. They should make the character and the story more interesting.

## Kobold

All kobolds have the _trapster_ ability. When a kobold makes a _trapster_ attack and rolls a natural attack roll that is higher than the target’s Wisdom, the creature has maneuvered the target into a trap with the attack. A creature can only be subjected to one trap per round.

When a kobold triggers its _trapster_ ability, determine the damage the trap deals by rolling a 1d4, then adding the escalation die. If there’s a dungeon-shaman in the battle, use a d8 instead of a d4.

Kobold traps can deal ongoing damage to the target instead of regular damage, if that makes sense for the trap. For ongoing damage, roll 1d4 (or 1d8) plus the escalation die, and then subtract one (minimum 1).

Kobold traps can impose conditions upon the target, if you choose. Roll normal trap damage, but the trap only deals half damage (minimum 1). Then roll a d4 for the condition the trap imposes upon the target until the end of its next turn.

1.  The target is stuck.
2.  The target is hampered.
3.  The target is dazed.
4.  The target is vulnerable.

Trap types vary according to the location/terrain and the whim of the GM.

## Lammasu

_Flight:_ All lammasu fly. Warrior lammasu fly with upright dignity, sometimes a bit slower than is wise. Fallen lammasu fly well enough to keep up with all but the quickest demons. Lammasu wizards and priests fly more gracefully than the warriors, but only because they’re less eager to run into things.

_Minor servitors:_ When a lammasu isn’t in combat or resting in stone-form, it’s usually surrounded by a fawning retinue of spirit servants. The servants look like people from ages the world no longer remembers. They stick close to the lammasu, seldom or never speak, and in truth may be a projection of the lammasu’s spirit or will. The spirits are no use in combat, but they can manipulate small objects such as combs and scented perfumes to use upon the lammasu’s beard, hair, and jewelry.

_Stone rest:_ Outside the overworld, lammasu who wish to rest can transform themselves into solid stone. A lammasu can see and hear as if it were still made of flesh. It can change back to flesh as a free action, but must wait a day before returning to stone, which is no great delay for lammasu guardians whose positions extend for decades or centuries. Considering that many sculptors carve stone lammasu to place in front of or within important structures, it’s deliberately difficult for a thief or assassin to know whether he is facing a stone statue or a transformed beast.  
 Note that this form of solid stone is different from the living stone form sometimes adopted by the lammasu warrior, wizard, and priest during battle.

## Naga

Nastier Special for all naga

_Arcane balance:_ Whenever the naga rolls a natural 1–5 with an attack roll, it can cancel one magical effect created by a spell or magic item that is affecting the naga or a nearby creature (including beneficial effect on a PC). It can be an ongoing effect, an effect that only lasts a round, or even an effect that was supposed to last until the end of the battle. Use your sense of what is magical and what isn’t: a bard’s song is clearly magical, but a rogue’s Shadow Walk talent probably isn’t, despite the wizard’s arguments that it _should_ be.

## Ooze

All oozes have the following two abilities:

_Flows where it likes:_ The ooze is immune to opportunity attacks.

_Ooze:_ The ooze is immune to effects. When an attack applies a condition to an ooze (dazed, hampered, weakened, ongoing damage, etc.), that condition doesn’t affect it.

The first thing the creature does on its turn is use a standard action to make a display of power that has no practical benefit. The GM chooses the attack, spell, or other power, which should be the most powerful one the character has, preferably a daily. The target expends the power in a great show of prowess, aimed for display rather than effect.

The target chooses one: either let the onslaught slam its mind (take 15 psychic damage), or steel its mind against the onslaught (stunned until the end of the pixie’s next turn).</p><p><i>5:</i> Compulsion to dance. The target takes 5 ongoing psychic damage (no save) until it spends a standard action to dance maniacally. Dancing ends all such ongoing damage, even if the target has been hit multiple times with this effect.</p><p><i>6:</i> Pacifism. The target can’t attack until the end of the pixie’s next turn.</p><p><i>Dazzling lights:</i> During battle, pixies fill the air with the light and sound of countless flashy illusions. The effects are disorienting enough that the PCs don’t get to add the escalation die to their attacks.</p><p><i>Flight:</i> Pixies make flying look like a lot of fun.</p><p><i>Invisibility:</i> When an enemy attacks a pixie and misses, the pixie turns invisible until the start of its next turn (even if it makes opportunity attacks).

A PC who wants to locate the pixie-pod must spend a standard action searching and succeed at a DC 25 skill check using Wisdom.

## Specter

Nastier Specials for all specters

_Aura of loss:_ The first time during a battle the specter is staggered, each nearby enemy with 30 hp or fewer is hampered until the end of the specter’s next turn. (9<sup>th</sup> level dread specter affects enemies with 60 hp or fewer.)

_Healing drain:_ When an enemy engaged with a specter heals, it heals only half the normal hit points, and the specter heals the other half (round down).

_Spectral evasion:_ Once per battle as a free action when an enemy attacks the specter, it can force the attacker to reroll the attack and use the result the specter prefers.

It will swallow a grabbed enemy in 1d3 rounds (see <i>swallow whole</i>).<br> <i>Natural 16+:</i> The tarrasque swallows the target immediately (see <i>swallow whole</i>).</p><p><b>Immense spike, horn, or tusk +18 vs. AC</b> — 155 damage<br> <i>Natural 16+:</i> The target takes 9d6 extra damage and pops free from the tarrasque as it’s hurled far away.</p><p><b>C: Earth-shaking, taloned claw +20 vs. AC (each nearby enemy in a group)</b> — 155 damage<br> <i>Natural 16+:</i> The target is stunned (save ends).<br> <i>Miss:</i> The target is dazed (save ends).</p><p><b>C: Cataclysmic tail slam +18 vs. PD (each nearby enemy in a group)</b> — 170 damage<br> <i>Natural 16+:</i> The target is vulnerable (save ends).<br> <i>Miss:</i> The target is dazed until the end of its next turn.</p><p><i>Amphibious:</i> The tarrasque can swim and breathe underwater (or it holds so much air in its vast lungs that it makes no difference).</p><p><i>Enormously bulky:</i> The tarrasque is so huge that it ignores opportunity attacks. In addition, normal-sized enemies are like fleas to it, and disengaging from the tarrasque requires only an easy save (6+), unless the target is grabbed.</p><p><i>Immortal:</i> The tarrasque can’t be killed, save by the explicit will of a god (and not some jumped-up local god, either) or, perhaps, the sacrifice of a great icon. The tarrasque’s HP total indicates the amount of damage required to make it disgorge swallowed enemies and flee to go hibernate while it regenerates the damage it suffered and decide if it wants to rampage again.</p><p><i>Inflexible:</i> The tarrasque can’t easily fight foes that get onto its back, and may not even notice them if they aren’t attacking it. When it does tire of a passenger, it can either use its <i>tail slam</i> attack (–2 attack penalty: on a hit, the target only takes half damage and is knocked off the tarrasque [possibly falling damage]; on a miss, the target takes no damage) or a <i>drag</i> attack as a standard action, crushing the rider between its shell and a mountainside or other high, hard obstacle.</p><p><b>Drag +21 vs. PD (each creature on its back)</b> — 130 damage, the target pops free of the tarrasque, and the target is hampered (save ends)</p><p><i>Legendary resistance:</i> The tarrasque is immune to normal conditions and effects (stunned, weakened, etc.), but it isn’t completely impervious. Bypassing its resistances requires icon-supported effort. A PC can use one 5 or 6 they acquired from icon relationship dice rolls to overcome the resistance each time they use an attack or power that would apply a condition or effect upon the tarrasque. Of course, they must also provide a story to go along with the reason the tarrasque is affected.</p><p><i>Leveler:</i> When the escalation die is even, as a move action the tarrasque can demolish any ordinary structure it can reach, such as a house, castle wall, temple, or ship. The beast automatically reduces the structure to rubble, rendering it useless. Each creature on top of or within the structure is subject to a <i>collapse</i> attack.</p><p><b>Collapse +18 vs. PD (each creature in/on the structure)</b> — 90 damage, and the target is stuck and takes 20 ongoing damage (hard save ends both, 16+)</p><p><i>Swallow whole:</i> Once a creature is swallowed, it goes inside one of the tarrasque’s gigantic stomachs. It can still act while inside the tarrasque, but it will have to deal with the beast’s stomach acid that is splashing around. A swallowed creature must deal 400 damage to the tarrasque to force it to disgorge the contents of its gullet, freeing the creature. During the tarrasque’s turn, it can make a <i>gullet digestion</i> attack against the target as a free action.</p><p><b>Gullet digestion +19 vs. PD</b> — 80 acid damage, and 20 ongoing acid damage<br> <i>Miss:</i> 5d12 acid damage.</p><p><i>Soft-ish innerbelly:</i> The tarrasque doesn’t have scales on the inside. It takes a –5 penalty to all defenses against attacks from inside its gullet, though only melee and close attacks can be made in there. The tarrasque’s insides are immune to acid damage, however.</p><p><span>Nastier Specials</span></p><p><i>Fear:</i> While engaged with the tarrasque, enemies that have 216 hp or fewer are dazed (–4 attack) and do not add the escalation die to their attacks.</p><p><i>Regeneration 230:</i> While a tarrasque is damaged, its malign magical flesh heals 230 hit points at the start of the tarrasque’s turn. It can regenerate five times per battle. If it heals up to its maximum hit points, then that use of <i>regeneration</i> doesn’t count against the five-use limit. With this power, the monstrosity is likely unstoppable without a powerful magical artifact designed specifically to bind, wound, or otherwise hamper the tarrasque.</p></td><td><p><b>AC</b></p><p><b>PD</b></p><p><b>MD</b></p><p><b>HP</b></p></td><td><p><b>31</b></p><p><b>29</b></p><p><b>25</b></p><p><b>2130</b></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

## Treant

All treants except awakened tress have the _demolish_ ability.

_Free-form ability — Demolish:_ Given time, treants are capable of pulling apart just about anything that’s been put together. Their roots squeeze into spaces between paving stones, slowly pulling them up and out of place. Their branches can likewise worm their way into spaces in walls, doors, and gates, and with steady pressure they can pull down most human-made structures. This slow-motion destruction takes minutes for the simplest efforts and hours for major demolition.

## Troglodyte

For all troglodytes

_Trog stench:_ Trogs spray scents that stink so badly that other humanoids take penalties to all attacks, defenses, and saves when engaged with a troglodyte or when nearby three or more troglodytes. Non-humanoids aren’t affected.  
 Humanoids affected by _trog stench_ can make a normal save (with a penalty) at the end of each of their turns. If the save succeeds, the humanoid can ignore all _trog stench_ for the rest of the battle.  
 _Trog stench_ penalties vary for different humanoid races:

| Race | Save Penalty |
| --- | --- |
| Elves, gnolls, gnomes | –4 |
| Humans, halflings, half-elves, holy ones, tieflings, almost everyone else | –3 |
| Half-orcs, dragonics | –2 |
| Dwarves | –1 |
| Forgeborn | 0 |

Warbanners have a number of abilities in common. The feral warbanner has the full version of these abilities. You may customize the feral warbanner by giving it icon-associated abilities.

A warbanner generally commands large groups of mooks that are simple to play. Creatures in a warbanner’s band are allies fully under its control. It could also have allies not in its band.

## Werebeasts

Each werebeast can take one of three forms as a quick action once per round: A humanoid form, a beast form, or a hybrid form that combines the two. The hybrid form is the most powerful in combat, but the humanoid and beast forms are useful for various activities outside of combat as well.

The stats below work for the beast and hybrid forms. If a werebeast ends up fighting in humanoid form, subtract 2 from all its defenses and halve its normal attack damage.

The following powers are common for werebeasts.

_Beast heart (all three forms):_ Animals of the werebeast’s type are intuitively on good terms with the were, even dire animals. If the werebeast betrays them, however, retaliation is certain and merciless.

_Cursed bite (hybrid or animal form only):_ While the moon is full, the first time each battle a creature takes damage from a werebeast melee attack, it takes 10 extra damage (champion: 20 damage; epic: 40 damage). The malignant curse, transmitted through the attack, shocks the mortal flesh. Further attacks, even from weres of different types, don’t cause extra damage. Unless blessed, purged, or otherwise cured, the damaged creature will turn into a werebeast on the night of the next full moon. Heroes powerful enough to fight werebeasts can usually find benefactors or rituals to cure them, but there’s an exception to every rule. GM, if you’re unsure whether it’s a full moon, roll a d10. On a 1–3, the moon is full enough.

_Resilient shifting (all three forms):_ As mentioned above, a werebeast can shift forms once per round as a quick action. When a werebeast shifts, it can roll a save against one save ends effect.

Nastier Specials for all werebeasts

The following ability is extremely nasty when combined with the _bestial fury_ most werebeasts have. It’s possibly better used as a story option, a consequence of a problem with a skill check or an icon relationship, or a situation that should have been avoided and may require sacrifices to deal with:

_Moon fury (hybrid form only):_ While fighting in moonlight, a werebeast gains a bonus to damage equal to its level (champion: double its level; epic: triple it).
