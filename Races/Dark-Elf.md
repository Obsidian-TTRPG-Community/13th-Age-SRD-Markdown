# Dark Elf

## Racial Bonus

+2 Dex or +2 Cha

## Adventurer Feat (Elf)

*__Heritage of the Sword__*
If you can already use swords that deal d6 and d8 damage without attack penalties, you gain a +2 damage bonus with them. (This bonus doesn’t increase miss damage.)
Otherwise, if your class would ordinarily have an attack penalty with such swords, you can now use them without penalties.

## Racial Power

*__Cruel__*
Once per battle, deal ongoing damage to a target you hit with a natural even attack roll as a free action. The ongoing damage equals 5 times your level. (For example, at 3rd level you would deal 15 ongoing damage against a single target.) As usual, a normal save (11+) ends the damage. A critical hit doesn’t double this ongoing damage.

*__Dark Elf Champion Feat__*
Once per day, you can instead use cruel to deal 5 ongoing damage per level against an enemy you miss or that you roll a natural odd attack against.
