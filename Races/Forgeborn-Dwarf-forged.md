# Forgeborn/Dwarf-forged

## Racial Bonus

+2 Str or +2 Con

## Racial Power

*__Never Say Die__*
Whenever you drop to 0 hp or below, roll a normal save if you have a recovery available.

On an 11+, instead of falling unconscious, you stay on your feet and can heal using a recovery. Add the recovery hit points to 0 hp to determine your hp total.

*__Forgeborn/Dwarf-forged Champion Feat__*
If you roll a 16+ on your *never-say-die* save, you gain an additional standard action during your next turn.
