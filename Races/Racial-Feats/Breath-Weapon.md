# Breath Weapon

__Requirements__:: __[Dragonic](../Dragonic-Dragonspawn.md)__ or __[Dragonspawn](../Dragonic-Dragonspawn.md)__

Once per battle, make a close-quarters breath weapon attack as a quick action using your highest ability score against one nearby enemyâ€™s Physical Defense.

On a hit, the attack deals 1d6 (`dice: 1d6`) damage per your level of an energy type that makes sense for your character.
