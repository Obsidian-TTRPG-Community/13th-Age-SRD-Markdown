# Cruel

__Requirements__:: __[Dark Elf](../Dark-Elf.md)__

Once per battle, deal ongoing damage to a target you hit with a natural even attack roll as a free action. The ongoing damage equals 5 times your level. (For example, at 3rd level you would deal 15 ongoing damage against a single target.) As usual, a normal save (11+) ends the damage. A critical hit doesnâ€™t double this ongoing damage.
