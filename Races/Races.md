# Races

The major races included in the 13th Age Archmage Engine include humans, dwarves, elves, gnomes, half-elves, half-orcs, and halflings. Your character need not be limited to these races, however. Minor races, including Dragonic/Dragonspawn, Holy One/Aasimar, Forgeborn/Dwarf-forged, and Tiefling/Demontouched, are also referenced below.

Each race is associated with two **ability scores**, one of which can be chosen for your characterâ€™s racial bonus.

The character also receives a separate class bonus. These two bonuses must apply to different ability scores.

Each race also provides the character a special power that can be used once per battle. (It is regained after a quick rest.) This is called the _racial power_.

> __13th Age SRD Markdown Note__: Each racial power is listed under each Race. Additionally, the powers are also kept in individual files in the Box_of_Powers folder for character sheets and other linking purposes if needed. 
> 
> You may delete them if you do not need them.
