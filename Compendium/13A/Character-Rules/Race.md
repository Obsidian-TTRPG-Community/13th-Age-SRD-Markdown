## Race

Every character has a race (see **[Races](Compendium/13A/Races/Races.md)**). Pick one for your character. If you want to make a non-standard race for your character, the rules won’t hinder you. The system is designed to be flexible enough to allow for improvisation.

Each race provides a +2 bonus to one of your **[ability scores](Compendium/13A/Character-Rules/Abilities.md)**.
