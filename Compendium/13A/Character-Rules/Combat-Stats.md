## Combat Stats

For details on how combat works, see **[Combat Rules](Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Rules.md)**.

Although Armor Class (AC), Physical Defense (PD), and Mental Defense (MD) are based on a single ability score, the score each defense uses depends on the character. In each case, you look at three ability modifiers and use the middle value (not the highest or the lowest). If two or more modifiers are tied, you use one of those tied scores as the middle score.

### 1st Level Hit Points

1. Find the base value for your class (6, 7, or 8) in the Starting Stats for 1st Level Characters chart.
2. Add your Constitution (CON) modifier to get your “hit point value.”
3. Multiply your hit point value by 3 to get your total hit points at 1st level.

### Armor Class

1. Find the base AC value for your class (10 to 16) in the Starting Stats for 1st Level Characters chart.
2. Find the middle value among your Con modifier, Dexterity (DEX) modifier, and Wisdom (WIS) modifier. That value is your AC modifier.
3. Add the AC modifier to your base AC value.
4. Add +1 at 1st level (and increase by +1 at each additional class level).

### Physical Defense

1. Find the base PD for your class (10 to 12) in the Starting Stats for 1st Level Characters chart.
2. Find the middle value among your Strength (STR) modifier, Con modifier, and Dex modifier. That value is your PD modifier.
3. Add the PD modifier to your base PD.
4. Add +1 at 1st level (and increase by +1 at each additional class level).

### Mental Defense

1. Find the base MD for your class (10 to 12) in the Starting Stats for 1st Level Characters chart.
2. Find the middle value among your Intellect (INT) modifier, Wisdom (WIS) modifier, and Charisma (CHA) modifier. That value is your MD modifier.
3. Add the MD modifier to your base MD.
4. Add +1 at 1st level (and increase by +1 for each class level).

### Initiative

Your Initiative bonus is a d20 check, not a static value.

1. Start with your Dex modifier.
2. Add +1 at 1st level (and increase by +1 at each additional class level).

### Recoveries & Recovery Dice

Most characters start the game with 8 recoveries. (See **Recoveries**). Some classes and talent choices may give you more recoveries.

Each class also has a different recovery die, usually a d6, d8, or d10, as specified in the class write-up. When you roll a recovery, you’ll roll a number of recovery dice equal to your level and add your Constitution modifier.

### Attacks and Powers

You calculate attack and damage rolls based on the **[ability scores](Compendium/13A/Character-Rules/Abilities.md)** favored by your class or by the specific powers you choose within your class. Most classes use one specific ability score for most of their attacks.

See **Classes** for more information.
