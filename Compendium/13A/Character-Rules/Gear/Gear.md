## Gear

Every character has a set of gear. Each class lists the type of gear a member of that class normally uses. You can equip non-magical gear as your backgrounds and character history suggest.

As a guide to what costs what, use the [Equipment Price Guide](Compendium/13A/Character-Rules/Gear/Equipment-Price-Guide.md).
