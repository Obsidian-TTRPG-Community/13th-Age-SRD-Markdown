## Ritual Casting

**Adventurer Tier**

You can cast any spells you know as [[Compendium/13A/Running-the-Game/Rituals|rituals]]. Classes that are already ritual casters ([[Compendium/13A/Classes/Cleric|Cleric]], [[Compendium/13A/Classes/Wizard|Wizard]]) donâ€™t need this feat.

(See **[[Compendium/13A/Running-the-Game/Rituals|Rituals]]** for ritual casting rules.)
