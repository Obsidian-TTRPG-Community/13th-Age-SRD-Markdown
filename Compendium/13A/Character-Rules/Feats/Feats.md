## Feats

Characters choose a feat at 1st level, and at every subsequent level.

Feats appear in three tiers:

1. Adventurer feats
2. Champion feats
3. Epic feats.

Adventurer feats are available to any character between level 1 and level 10.

Champion feats are available starting at level 5.

Epic feats are available starting at level 8.
