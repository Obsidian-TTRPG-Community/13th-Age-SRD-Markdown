>[!info] Since humans start with an additional feat at 1st level, add one to the number of adventurer [[Compendium/13A/Character-Rules/Feats/Feats|feats]] humans possess all the way up the chart.

Most of the feats in the game are attached to specific class talents, attacks, and spells.

If a feat is attached to a talent, power, or spell, you **must** have the talent, power, or spell in order to choose the feat.

When there is more than one feat attached to a specific talent or power, you **have** to choose the **lower tier feats** before you pick up the **higher tier feats**.
