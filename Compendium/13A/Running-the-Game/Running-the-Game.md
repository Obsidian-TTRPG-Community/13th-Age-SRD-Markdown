## Rules

### Using Icon Relationships

For basic icon relationship rules, see [[Compendium/13A/Character-Rules/Icon-Relationships|Icon Relationships]].

As a GM, use a PCs’ icon relationships three different ways: 
- for starting a session
- for in-game dramatic events
- for discovery and surprise

#### Rolling Relationships at the Start of a Session

All players roll their PC’s icon relationship dice at the start of each session, and everybody sees the results. As usual, rolling a 6 with an icon die provides an unambiguous advantage. Rolling a 5 provides a similar advantage, but the benefit is balanced by complications and obligations that advance the story. By the end of the session, each 6 or 5 should contribute to the story somehow, either at the GM’s or player’s [[Compendium/13A/Monsters/Monster-Creation/Initiative|initiative]].

The GM uses the results to think ahead about which icons come to the fore this session. Players use the results to start thinking about how their icon relationships might manifest in the story.

As GM, you bear most of the burden of improvising story elements based on the PCs’ icon relationship results. Your players may have great suggestions, but it’s on you to weave them together with the story elements and battles you have already prepared… or are planning to improvise on the spot.

##### Rolling New Story-guide Dice Mid-session

Story events and talents can create new icon relationships in the middle of play. Allow players to roll newly acquired icon dice right away as if they’d had them at the start of the session.

#### Icon Relationship Rolls as Dramatic Events

Players roll all of their relationship dice for a particular icon when their PCs are confronting that icon’s representatives, agents, or minions. The GM decides when an event-based roll is called for.

Story-guide rolls should occur most every session. Event-based rolls rise out of circumstances during play.

It’s never the player’s choice to roll icon relationship dice for dramatic events. When new circumstances and dramatic events force or suggest interactions or confrontations with forces or situations associated with a particular icon, the GM can call for an icon relationship roll as a shorthand guide to the dramatic results of the situation.

##### Rolling a 5 with Icon Events

Getting a 5 on an icon relationship check moves the story forward, just like a 6 does, but it also generates a complication. A 5 means both good and bad results. The negative result might be secret, it might be delayed, and it might be nothing more than a promise until you figure out what it really means.

#### Discovery & Surprise

At the GM’s option, players may roll icon relationship dice to find out which [[Compendium/13A/Icons/Icons|icons]] are involved in a plot element, if any. When the characters have slalomed onto paths and adventures you did not anticipate, icon relationship rolls can serve as an idea generator with mechanics that everyone already understands.

Discovery dice aren’t interpreted as positively as other icon relationship rolls. You’re using the icon dice more to determine whether an icon has a stake in what’s involved, not necessarily whether the situation is going to work to a PC’s advantage.

You’ll probably use this style of roll most often when the characters have gone off your map, chasing enemies you hadn’t anticipated, seeking treasures you referred to earlier without having a clear idea about, and taking forest paths you hadn’t been aware existed. GMs who enjoy being surprised by new developments may opt for discovery rolls before improvising the consequences of the PCs’ unexpected steps.

Using icon relationship rolls from one or more characters keeps the new developments relevant to the players and possibly relevant to the overarching plot.

### Environments

Any place in the game world that a player might want to make a skill check is an environment, of which there are three tiers: adventurer, champion, and epic.

Adventurer environments are for level **1-3** characters: 
- city streets
- wilderness areas
- shallow dungeons
- regular old ruins
- …and that sort of thing.

Champion environments are for level **4-6** characters: 
- deeper dungeons
- danker swamps
- guarded gates of the big cities
- …and those sorts of places.

Epic environments are for level **7**+ characters. They are typically related to icons, unique villains, deep underworld locations, the most forbidding peaks, the upper reaches of the world, and so on.

The GM determines the environs where the adventure takes place.

#### Environment Chart by Level

| Level | Type of Environment              |
|-------|----------------------------------|
| 1–3   | Always adventurer                |
| 4     | Mostly adventurer, some champion |
| 5     | Half adventurer, half champion   |
| 6     | Mostly champion, some adventurer |
| 7     | Mostly champion, some epic       |
| 8     | Half champion, half epic         |
| 9     | Mostly epic, some champion       |
| 10    | Always epic                      |

#### Environment DCs for Skill Checks

The environment the PCs are in determines the DC of skill checks and other challenges they may face.

##### Adventurer-tier Skill Check DCs

| Task                   | DC    |
|------------------------|-------|
| Normal task            | DC 15 |
| Hard task              | DC 20 |
| Ridiculously hard task | DC 25 |      
^13A-DC-Adventurer-Skill

##### Champion-tier Skill Check DCs

| Task                   | DC    |
|------------------------|-------|
| Normal task            | DC 20 |
| Hard task              | DC 25 |
| Ridiculously hard task | DC 30 |      
^13A-DC-Champion-Skill

##### Epic-tier Skill Check DCs

| Task                   | DC    |
|------------------------|-------|
| Normal task            | DC 25 |
| Hard task              | DC 30 |
| Ridiculously hard task | DC 35 |

#### Impromptu Damage

When you need to determine how much damage some effect deals, use the chart below, basing the damage on two things: the environment, and whether the damage affects one character or many.

#### Traps & Obstacles

As shown in the chart below, attack rolls for traps and other features of the environment follow the same mathematical model as DCs for skill checks.

Use the skill check DC on the table to give you a general guideline for PCs attempting to disarm a trap (once they notice that there is a trap). Failure means the trap will trigger.

**Skill Check DCs, Trap/Obstacle Attacks & Impromptu Damage by Environment**

| Tier       | Degree of Challenge | Skill Check DC | Trap or Obstacle Attack Roll vs. AC/PD/MD | Impromptu Damage (Single Target) | Impromptu Damage (Multiple Targets) |

### Full Heal-ups

A party should get a full heal-up after approximately: 
- 4 regular battles
- 3 hard battles
- 2 regular battles and 1 very hard battle

For storytelling, try to sync [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Rest-and-Recharge/Full-Heal-ups|full heal-ups]] with an appropriate event in the game world.

If the PCs find some special source of healing when they don’t deserve a full heal-up yet, allow them to get one or two recoveries back and to make some extra recharge rolls.

If the party is able to rest and decides to heal-up ahead of time, they suffer a campaign loss. The story moves along, but the situation in the campaign gets noticeably worse for the party (at the GM’s discretion).
