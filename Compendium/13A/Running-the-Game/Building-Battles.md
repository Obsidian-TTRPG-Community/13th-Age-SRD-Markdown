## Building Battles

- For adventure tier, levels 1-4, start with one enemy creature of the party’s level per PC. 
- At champion tier, levels 5-7, start with one enemy creature per PC, with each creature being one level higher than the PCs.
- At epic tier, levels 8–10, the monsters should weigh in at two levels above the PCs if they appear in equal numbers.

Lower-level monsters count as fractions of an adventurer-level monster, and higher-level monsters count as multiples. 

See the monster equivalents chart below.

^13A-Monster-Equivalents

### Mooks

- At champion and epic tier, it takes 5 mooks to equal one standard creature(5:1). 
- At first and second level, use 3 mooks as a standard creature if the mooks are the same level, an equivalent of .33 (3:1). 
- At third and fourth level, use up to four mooks per monster, or .25 (4:1). 

### Large Monsters

A large (or double-strength) monster counts as 2 standard monsters.

### Huge Monsters

A huge (or triple-strength) monster counts as 3 standard monsters.

### Monster Special Abilities

When you use monsters with especially nasty special abilities, be aware of the increased threat that they represent and take that into account.

### Unfair Encounters

To make the battle more difficult, consider outfitting the monsters in the battle with these features:
- Potent powers
- Nastier specials
- Weight of numbers
- Reinforcements
- Advantageous terrain
