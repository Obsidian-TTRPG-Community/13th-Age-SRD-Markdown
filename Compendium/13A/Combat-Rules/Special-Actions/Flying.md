## Flying

Some [[Compendium/13A/Classes/Classes|classes]] have spells or talents that enable *flight*. The movement rules for *flight* are the same as for other movement, except that, as long as there is space available, you can fly over enemies youâ€™re not [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Actions/Movement-and-Melee/Engaged|engaged]] with without allowing them to take opportunity [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Attacks/Attacks|attacks]] against you. You can be intercepted only by other flyers that are already airborne.

The engagement and disengagement rules are also the same when flyers make melee attacks against enemies on the ground. The player may choose to swoop past another flyer, as part of another attack, instead of engaging it directly, at a -2 attack penalty.
