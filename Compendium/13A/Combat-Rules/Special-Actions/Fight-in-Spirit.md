## Fight in Spirit

This is a special combat action that you can take when you are out of the fight altogether. Once a round you can specify how your character is still there “fighting in spirit” alongside the other party members. Come up with some story about what your character has done that could boost party morale. The GM may grant any ally a +1 bonus to [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Attacks/Attacks|attacks]], [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Stats/Defences/Armor-Class|Armor Class]], [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Stats/Defences/Physical-Defense|Physical Defense]], or Mental Defense. The first time each battle that someone fights in spirit may be a +2 bonus.

The bonus lasts one to two rounds. If the fight is still on and you have something else to add to the story, sell it to the GM.

If you’re still (even partly) in the fight, then you can’t fight in spirit.
