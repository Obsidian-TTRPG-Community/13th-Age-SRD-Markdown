## Rally

Once a battle, every PC can use a [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Sequence/Actions-on-Your-Turn/Standard-Move-and-Quick-Actions/Standard-Move-and-Quick-Actions|standard action]] to rally, spending one of their [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Damage-and-Healing/Recoveries|recoveries]] and regaining [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Stats/Hit-Points|hit points]] they’ve lost in combat. (See Recoveries.)

If you want to rally again later in the same battle, make a normal [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Special-Attacks-and-Effects/Saves|save]] (11+). If you succeed, you can rally again that round using another standard action. If you fail the save, you can take your turn normally, but you can’t rally that round.
