## Rally

Once a battle, every PC can use a standard action to rally, spending one of their recoveries and regaining hit points they’ve lost in combat. (See Recoveries.)

If you want to rally again later in the same battle, make a normal save (11+). If you succeed, you can rally again that round using another standard action. If you fail the save, you can take your turn normally, but you can’t rally that round.
