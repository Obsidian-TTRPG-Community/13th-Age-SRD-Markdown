## Flee

Fleeing is a party action. On any PCâ€™s turn, any player can propose that all the characters flee the fight. If all players agree, they successfully retreat, carrying any fallen heroes away with them. The party suffers a campaign loss. The point of this rule is to encourage daring [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Attacks/Attacks|attacks]] and to make retreating interesting on the level of story rather than tactics.
