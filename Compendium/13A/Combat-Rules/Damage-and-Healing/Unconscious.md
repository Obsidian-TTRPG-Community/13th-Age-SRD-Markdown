## Unconscious

When you drop to 0 hp or below, you fall unconscious. You can’t take any actions until you’re conscious again, though you do make a death save at the start of each of your turns. (See Death and Dying.)

When monsters drop to 0 hp, it means they’ve been slain, unless the characters’ intent is to keep the monster alive and the attack seems like a potentially humane blow that could knock the monster unconscious instead.
