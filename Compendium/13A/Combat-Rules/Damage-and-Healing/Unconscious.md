## Unconscious

When you drop to 0 hp or below, you fall unconscious. You can’t take any [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Actions/Actions/Actions|actions]] until you’re conscious again, though you do make a death [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Special-Attacks-and-Effects/Saves|save]] at the start of each of your turns. (See Death and Dying.)

When [[Compendium/13A/Monsters/Monsters|monsters]] drop to 0 hp, it means they’ve been slain, unless the characters’ intent is to keep the monster alive and the attack seems like a potentially humane blow that could knock the monster unconscious instead.
