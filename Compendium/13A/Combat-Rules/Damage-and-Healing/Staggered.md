## Staggered

When you are reduced to half your [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Stats/Hit-Points|hit points]] or fewer, you’re *staggered*. Some powers, spells, and monster interactions work differently when you are staggered.

In general, [[Compendium/13A/Monsters/Monsters|monsters]] become staggered when they take damage equal to half their hit points or more, but it’s up to the GM.
