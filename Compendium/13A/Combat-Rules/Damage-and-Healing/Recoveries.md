## Recoveries

Each PC starts the adventure with 8 or 9 recoveries, a stat that represents the PC’s ability to heal or bounce back from damage. Many healing spells and potions require you to use up a recovery. So does rallying during a battle.

When you use a recovery, regain lost [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Stats/Hit-Points|hit points]] by rolling recovery dice equal to your level and adding your Constitution modifier. Your [[Compendium/13A/Character-Rules/Class|class]] indicates which recovery die to use.

At 5<sup>th</sup> level, double the bonus you get from your Con modifier. At 8<sup>th</sup> level, triple it.

If you perform an action that requires a recovery but have none left, you get half the healing you would otherwise get and take a –1 penalty to all [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Stats/Defences/Defences|defences]] and attack rolls until your next full heal-up. This penalty stacks for each recovery used that you don’t possess.
