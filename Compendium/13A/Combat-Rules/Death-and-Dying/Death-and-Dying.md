## Death and Dying

When you drop to 0 hp or below, you fall [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Damage-and-Healing/Unconscious|unconscious]] and can’t take any [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Actions/Actions/Actions|actions]] (except to make death [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Special-Attacks-and-Effects/Saves|saves]]).

To make a death save, roll a d20 at the start of your turn. If you roll 16+, use a recovery to return to consciousness and heal up to the number of [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Stats/Hit-Points|hit points]] you rolled with your recovery. If you roll a natural 20, you get to take actions normally that turn. If you roll 15 or less, you take one step toward the grave. After the fourth failed death save in a single battle, you die.

You also die when you reach negative hit points equal to half your maximum hit points.

If you’re able to use one of your [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Damage-and-Healing/Recoveries|recoveries]] (or otherwise get healed) while you are dying, ignore your current negative hit points. Start from 0 and add the hit points you’ve regained.

If one of your [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Actions/Movement-and-Melee/Special-Cases/Allies|allies]] is [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Damage-and-Healing/Unconscious|unconscious]] and you don’t have magic to heal them, you can still stabilize them to keep them from dying. Get next to them and make a DC 10 healing skill check using Wisdom as a standard action. Failure wastes your standard action, but doesn’t hurt your friend. Success stabilizes your ally. If your stabilization check is 25+, you treat their wounds so quickly that it only takes a quick action; you can use your standard action normally that turn.

A stabilized character is still unconscious, rolling death saves on their turn, but failed death saves no longer take them a step closer to death. Ignore failed death saves while stabilized.

Feeding a dying character a healing potion gets them conscious and back on their feet, but always takes a standard action.
