## Optional Lasting-Wound Rule

If you’re dropped to 0 hp or below one or more times during a fight, you take a lasting-wound. Each lasting-wound reduces your maximum hp by an amount equal to 2 + your level. Lasting-wounds are cumulative. *[[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Damage-and-Healing/Staggered|Staggered]]* is still half or less of your maximum [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Stats/Hit-Points|hit points]]. A full heal-up removes all lasting-wounds.
