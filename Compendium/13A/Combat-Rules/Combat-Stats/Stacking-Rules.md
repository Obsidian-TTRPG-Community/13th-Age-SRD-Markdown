## Stacking Rules

Bonuses and effects to a single stat stack with each other, with these exceptions:

- Magic item bonuses don’t stack. Only the best one counts.
- Many condition penalties don’t stack. Only the worst one counts.
- Powers, spells, and [[Compendium/13A/Character-Rules/Abilities|abilities]] don’t stack with themselves or with other game elements with the same name. This works for both PCs and [[Compendium/13A/Monsters/Monsters|monsters]].
