## defences

There are three different defences: [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Stats/defences/Armor-Class|Armor Class]], [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Stats/defences/Physical-Defense|Physical Defense]], and [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Stats/defences/Mental-Defense|Mental Defense]]. Each uses three [[Compendium/13A/Character-Rules/Abilities|ability scores]] as part of its calculation. PCs also add their class level to their defences.
