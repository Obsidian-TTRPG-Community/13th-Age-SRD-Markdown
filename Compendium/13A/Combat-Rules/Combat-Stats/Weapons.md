## Weapons

[[Compendium/13A/Magic-Items/Magic-Item-Descriptions/Weapons|Weapons]] are rated by how much damage they deal. In the hands of player characters, each weapon attack deals 1 die of damage per character level + ability modifier, notated as WEAPON + \[Ability\].

Each [[Compendium/13A/Character-Rules/Class|class]] has its own version of the weapon chart, showing how well members of the class use weapons of a given damage category.
