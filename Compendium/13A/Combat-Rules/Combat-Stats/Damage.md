## Damage

Each attack indicates a specified amount of damage it does; subtract that amount from the target’s hit points. If the attack targets multiple enemies, you make a separate attack roll for each one, but only roll damage once.

Damage totals for your attacks are calculated by adding one ability score modifier to the attack’s damage roll, normally represented by saying “+ Ability.”

Calculate the ability modifier subtracting 10 from the ability score, halving the result, then rounding down.

At 5<sup>th</sup> level, double the ability score modifier before adding to the damage roll for all attacks. (Negative modifiers get are doubled too).

At 8<sup>th</sup> level, triple the ability score modifier.

Spells indicate a specific number of dice to roll for damage. Weapon attacks work differently.
