## Attack Bonuses

For each attack, roll a d20 + an ability bonus + your level (+ magic item attack bonus, if any). Depending on the attack, you might also get other bonuses. Compare your total to the targetâ€™s defense, usually [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Stats/Defences/Armor-Class|Armor Class]] but sometimes [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Stats/Defences/Physical-Defense|Physical Defense]] or [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Stats/Defences/Mental-Defense|Mental Defense]]. If the total is equal to or higher than the defense, you hit. If you attack multiple targets, make multiple attack rolls. Your [[Compendium/13A/Character-Rules/Class|class]] defines which ability bonus you use on attack rolls, and the attack defines the effects of a hit or a miss.
