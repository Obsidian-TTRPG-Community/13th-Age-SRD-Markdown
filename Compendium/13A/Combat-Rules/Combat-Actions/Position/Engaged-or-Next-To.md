## Engaged/Next To

In a battle, each combatant is either [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Actions/Movement-and-Melee/Engaged|engaged]] (locked in combat with one or more enemies) or unengaged (free). When two [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Actions/Movement-and-Melee/Special-Cases/Allies|allies]] are engaged with the same enemy, they are considered next to each other.
