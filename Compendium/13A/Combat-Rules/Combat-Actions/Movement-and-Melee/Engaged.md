## Engaged

Characters are engaged when they are in melee with foes. Engaged creatures can use melee attacks and close-quarter spells against the creatures they engage. They can use [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Attacks/General-Attack-Rules/Ranged-Attacks|ranged attacks]] but doing so draws opportunity attacks from the enemies that are engaging them that they don’t attack, as does moving away from the enemies they’re engaged with.

Unengaged creatures have no particular limits on how they move. They can’t use melee attacks until engaged.
