## Ambushes and Surprise

In situations when one side ambushes or surprises the other, start by letting the ambushing side pick one creature who will start the ambush. Then roll [[Compendium/13A/Monsters/Monster-Creation/Initiative|initiative]] for all members of the ambushing side.

Only two creatures get to act in the ambush round: the nominated ambusher and their highest [[Compendium/13A/Monsters/Monster-Creation/Initiative|initiative]] ally. The GM can choose whether to advance the [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Sequence/Escalation-Die|escalation die]] after the surprise round.

Then roll initiative for the side that got ambushed and play normal combat rounds.
