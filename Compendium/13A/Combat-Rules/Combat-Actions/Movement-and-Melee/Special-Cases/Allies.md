## Allies

Powers and spells in various [[Compendium/13A/Classes/Classes|classes]] are written with the understanding that a character’s allies are the other PCs in the party with a possible addition for an animal companion. NPCs don’t count as allies for [[Compendium/13A/Character-Rules/Abilities|abilities]] that are counting the number of allies that meet certain [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Special-Attacks-and-Effects/Conditions/Conditions|conditions]].
