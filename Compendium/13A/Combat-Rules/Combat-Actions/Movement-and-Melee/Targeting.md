## Targeting

Important stats for targeting should be transparent to PCs. The GM should tell you whether your targets are legal targets, or whether they’re [[Compendium/13A/Monsters/Monster-Rules/Mooks|mooks]], normal [[Compendium/13A/Monsters/Monsters|monsters]], or large monsters.

A spell or area-style effect that targets multiple [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Actions/Position/Nearby|nearby]] enemies in a group can’t skip over enemies. You pick one target and attack the rest in order; you don’t skip all over the battlefield. Spells that say they target multiple nearby enemies but don’t specify that they have to be in a group are capable of sending magical energy in different directions, allowing spellcasters to choose targets from where they like.

When a spell or power targets a nearby enemy, ally, or creature, you can’t target yourself unless it is explicitly stated that you can also be a target.
