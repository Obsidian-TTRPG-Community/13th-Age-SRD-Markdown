## Quick Rests

When you take a quick rest, you can choose to heal yourself by using as many recoveries as you have available.

If you are staggered when you take a quick rest, you must try to heal yourself, either with a recovery or from a spell that provides some true healing.

For each recharge power that you used in the last battle, roll a d20 to see if you keep the power for your next battle or lose it until after your next battle. You have to roll the powerâ€™s recharge value or higher to use it again.
