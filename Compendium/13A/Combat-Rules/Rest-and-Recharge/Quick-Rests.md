## Quick Rests

When you take a quick rest, you can choose to heal yourself by using as many [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Damage-and-Healing/Recoveries|recoveries]] as you have available.

If you are [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Damage-and-Healing/Staggered|staggered]] when you take a quick rest, you must try to heal yourself, either with a recovery or from a spell that provides some true healing.

For each recharge power that you used in the last battle, roll a d20 to see if you keep the power for your next battle or lose it until after your next battle. You have to roll the power’s recharge value or higher to use it again.
