## Full Heal-ups

After approximately four battles, characters earn a full heal-up, though the exact number is determined by the GM. Tougher battle can mean more frequent heal-ups, and vice versa.

After a full heal-up, your [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Stats/Hit-Points|hit points]] reset to full. You regain any [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Damage-and-Healing/Recoveries|recoveries]] you’ve used. All expended powers are regained or recharged. (“Daily” powers are actually “per heal-up.”)

If the party is short of a heal-up but is too beat up to press on, they can retreat and take a full heal-up, which entails a campaign loss. (See [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Special-Actions/Flee|Flee]].)
