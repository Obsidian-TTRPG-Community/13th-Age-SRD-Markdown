## Temporary Hit Points

Temporary [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Stats/Hit-Points|hit points]] are beneficial effect that keeps a character from harm. When you gain temporary hit points, keep track of them separately from your regular hit points. Temporary hit points don’t stack; when you gain more temporary hit points while you still have temporary hit points left, use only the higher amount and ignore the lower amount.

When you take damage, subtract it from your temporary hit points first, and only apply damage to your regular hit points after the temporary hit points are used up.

Temporary hit points reset to 0 after a battle and drop to 0 when you roll [[Compendium/13A/Monsters/Monster-Creation/Initiative|initiative]].
