## Coup De Grace

When you attack a [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Special-Attacks-and-Effects/Conditions/Helpless|helpless]] enemy youâ€™re [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Actions/Movement-and-Melee/Engaged|engaged]] with, you score an automatic critical hit if you follow these three steps:

- Skip your [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Sequence/Actions-on-Your-Turn/Standard-Move-and-Quick-Actions/Standard-Move-and-Quick-Actions|move action]] and your quick action that turn.
- Make a standard action attack on your turn against the helpless enemy you are engaged with.
- Your attack only targets the helpless enemy, even if the attack would normally target multiple creatures.
