## Coup De Grace

When you attack a helpless enemy youâ€™re engaged with, you score an automatic critical hit if you follow these three steps:

- Skip your move action and your quick action that turn.

- Make a standard action attack on your turn against the helpless enemy you are engaged with.

- Your attack only targets the helpless enemy, even if the attack would normally target multiple creatures.
