## Grabbed

Some [[Compendium/13A/Monsters/Monsters|monsters]] grab you. Generally they grab you after a successful hit. A creature can let go of a creature it is grabbing as a free action.

When you’re grabbed you are [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Actions/Movement-and-Melee/Engaged|engaged]] with the creature grabbing you and you can’t move away unless you teleport, somehow pop free first, or successfully disengage. Disengage checks take a –5 penalty unless you hit the creature that is grabbing you the same turn that you’re trying to disengage.

If you are smaller than the creature that is grabbing you, it can move and carry you along with no problem. If you are the same size or larger, it has to let go of you if it wants to move.

Grabbed creatures can’t make opportunity [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Attacks/Attacks|attacks]]. That also applies if the creature grabbing you decides to let go and move away from you; it doesn’t have to disengage or take an opportunity attack from you, it just leaves you [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Actions/Position/Behind|behind]].

Grabbed creatures can’t use [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Attacks/General-Attack-Rules/Ranged-Attacks|ranged attacks]], although melee and close attacks are fine.

The creature grabbing you gets a +4 attack bonus against you.
