## Teleportation

Teleportation is an effect by which a creature moves instantaneously from one location to another. Teleporting doesn’t draw opportunity [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Attacks/Attacks|attacks]], but casting the spell may; spellcasting rules don’t change because you are casting a teleport spell.
