## Helpless

If you’re [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Damage-and-Healing/Unconscious|unconscious]] or asleep, you’re helpless. While helpless, you take a –4 penalty to all [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Stats/Defences/Defences|defences]] and you can be the target of a [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Special-Attacks-and-Effects/Coup-De-Grace|coup de grace]].
