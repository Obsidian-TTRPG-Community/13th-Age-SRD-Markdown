## Two-Weapon Fighting

You fight as normal, generally using the weapon in your main hand to attack. If your attack roll is a natural 2, you can reroll the attack but must use the reroll.

You do not get an extra attack for fighting with two weapons.

Some classes (and class talents) provide other advantages when fighting with two weapons. Those classes still get to use this basic two-weapon advantage.
