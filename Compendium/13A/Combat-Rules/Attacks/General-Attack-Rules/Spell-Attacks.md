## Spell Attacks

Most spells draw opportunity attacks from enemies engaged with you, even the enemies you target with the spell. Close-quarters spells are the exception; they donâ€™t draw opportunity attacks.

Like weapon attacks, you add your level to the attack roll for spell attacks, plus any magical implement or other bonuses you might have.
