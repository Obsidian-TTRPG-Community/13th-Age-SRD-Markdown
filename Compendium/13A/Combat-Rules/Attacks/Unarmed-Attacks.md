## Unarmed Attacks

To punch or kick, make a Strength attack with a –2 penalty (regardless of your class) against [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Stats/defences/Armor-Class|AC]]. If you hit, you deal 1d6 damage for every two levels you have, plus your Strength modifier. At odd levels, including 1<sup>st</sup> level, use a d3. If you miss, no damage.
