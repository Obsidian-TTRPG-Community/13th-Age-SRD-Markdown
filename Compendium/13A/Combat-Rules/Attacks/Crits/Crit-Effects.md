## Crit Effects

Standard crits deal double damage and, at the GMâ€™s discretion, might entail some additional superior result.

If you manage to double your crit damage (through the effect of a talent, power, spell or other source), triple it instead. If you manage to double your triple damage, bump it up to quadruple, and so on.
