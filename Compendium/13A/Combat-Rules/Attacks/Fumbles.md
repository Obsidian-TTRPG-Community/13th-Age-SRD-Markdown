## Fumbles

Rolling a natural 1 has no effect on the target, not even miss damage. At the GM’s discretion, rolling a 1 while in a precarious [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Actions/Position/Position|position]] might entail a bad result for the attacker. You might also hit an ally if you’re [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Modifiers/Shooting-into-Melee|shooting into melee]].
