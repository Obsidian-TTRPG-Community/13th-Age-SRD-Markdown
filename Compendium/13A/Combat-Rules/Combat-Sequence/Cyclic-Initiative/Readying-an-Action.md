## Readying an Action

The ready action lets you prepare to take an action later, after your turn is over but before your next one has begun. Readying is a [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Sequence/Actions-on-Your-Turn/Standard-Move-and-Quick-Actions/Standard-Move-and-Quick-Actions|standard action]].

You can ready a standard action, a move action, or a free action. To do so, specify the action you will take and the [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Special-Attacks-and-Effects/Conditions/Conditions|conditions]] under which you will take it. Then, any time before your next action, you may take the readied action in response to that condition. The action occurs just before the action that triggers it. If the triggered action is part of another character’s activities, you interrupt the other character. Assuming he is still capable of doing so, he continues his actions once you complete your readied action. Your [[Compendium/13A/Monsters/Monster-Creation/Initiative|initiative]] result changes. For the rest of the encounter, your initiative result is the count on which you took the readied action, and you act immediately ahead of the character whose action triggered your readied action.

Your initiative result becomes the count on which you took the readied action. If you come to your next action and have not yet performed your readied action, you don’t get to take the readied action (though you can ready the same action again). If you take your readied action in the next round, before your regular turn comes up, your initiative count rises to that new point in the order of battle, and you do not get your regular action that round.
