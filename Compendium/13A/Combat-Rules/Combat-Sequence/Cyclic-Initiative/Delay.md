## Delay

By choosing to delay, you take no action and then act normally on whatever [[Compendium/13A/Monsters/Monster-Creation/Initiative|initiative]] count you decide to act. When you delay, you voluntarily reduce your own initiative for the rest of the combat. Your initiative result becomes the count on which you took the delayed action.

If you come to your next action and have not yet performed an action, you donâ€™t get to take a delayed action (though you can delay again).

If you take a delayed action in the next round, before your regular turn comes up, your initiative count rises to that new point in the order of battle, and you do not get your regular action that round.
