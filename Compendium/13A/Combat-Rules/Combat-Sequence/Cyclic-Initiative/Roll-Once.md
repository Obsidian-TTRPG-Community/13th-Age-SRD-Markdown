## Roll Once

Each creature rolls to determine its [[Compendium/13A/Monsters/Monster-Creation/Initiative|initiative]] at the start of its first turn in battle (d20 + [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Stats/Initiative-Bonus|initiative bonus]]). Use those results to determine who goes first each round.

All [[Compendium/13A/Monsters/Monsters|monsters]] of the same exact type share the same [[Compendium/13A/Monsters/Monster-Creation/Initiative|initiative]] roll.
