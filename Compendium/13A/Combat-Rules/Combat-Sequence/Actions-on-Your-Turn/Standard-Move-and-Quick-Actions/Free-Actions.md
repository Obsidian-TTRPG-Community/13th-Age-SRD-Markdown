## Free Actions

You can take any number of free [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Sequence/Actions-on-Your-Turn/Actions-on-Your-Turn|actions on your turn]], as allowed by the GM. Creatures can also take free actions when itâ€™s not their turn as part of a triggering condition. Talking is a free action.
