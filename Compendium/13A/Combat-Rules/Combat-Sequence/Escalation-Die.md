## Escalation Die

The escalation die represents a bonus to [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Attacks/Attacks|attacks]] as the fight goes on.

At the start of the second round, the GM sets the escalation die at 1. Each PC gains a bonus to attack rolls equal to the current value on the escalation die. Each round, the escalation die advances by +1, to a maximum of +6.

[[Compendium/13A/Monsters/Monsters|Monsters]] and NPCs do not add the escalation die bonus to their attacks

If the GM judges that the characters are avoiding conflict rather than bringing the fight to the bad guys, the escalation die doesn't advance. If combat virtually ceases, the escalation die resets to 0.
