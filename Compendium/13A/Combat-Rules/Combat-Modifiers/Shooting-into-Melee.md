## Shooting into Melee

When using a ranged attack to target an enemy that is [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Actions/Movement-and-Melee/Engaged|engaged]] with one or more of your [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Actions/Movement-and-Melee/Special-Cases/Allies|allies]] and you fumble (roll a 1), reroll that attack considering the engaged ally as the target. If there are multiple allies, the GM rules which ally is the target.
