## Invisibility

Invisibility grants a big modifier to any stealth skill checks—at least +5 unless you’re dealing with creatures who can detect you without sight.

Once [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Actions/Movement-and-Melee/Engaged|engaged]] in battle, attacks against invisible enemies have a 50% chance to miss completely, before the attack roll. Attacks that miss in this fashion don’t deal any damage or have effects on the invisible creature, though other effects on a miss might occur.
