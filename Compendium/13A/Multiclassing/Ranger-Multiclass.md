## Ranger Multiclass

Like the [[Compendium/13A/Classes/Paladin|paladin]], your Level Progression table doesn’t have many [class](Compendium/13A/Character-Rules/Class.md)-specific elements. You won’t get the ranger’s normal bonus talents at 5th and 8th level, instead receiving them at 6th level and 9th level.

Unless you’ve multiclassed with one of the other skilled weapon-using [classes](Compendium/13A/Classes/Classes.md), your damage dice for the Double Melee Attack and Double Ranged Attack talents drop down another size (usually from d6s to d4s) as a multiclass [[Compendium/13A/Classes/Ranger|ranger]].

### Two-weapon Multiclass

#### Adventurer Tier

While you are fighting with two melee weapons, you now gain the benefit of your Two-Weapon Mastery talent and any [feats](Compendium/13A/Character-Rules/Feats/Feats.md) you’ve taken for it even when using attacks from your non-ranger class.

#### Adventurer Tier

You can use your Archery ranger talent and any feats you’ve taken for it even when using [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Attacks/General-Attack-Rules/Ranged-Attacks|ranged attacks]] from your non-ranger class.
