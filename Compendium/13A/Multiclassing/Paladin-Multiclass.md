## Paladin Multiclass

You don’t get the [[Compendium/13A/Classes/Paladin|paladin]]’s normal bonus talents at 5th and 8th level, instead receiving them at 6th level and 9th level.

### Armored in Life

#### Adventurer Tier

Once per battle while wearing heavy armor, use an attack from a [class](Compendium/13A/Character-Rules/Class.md) that normally takes an attack penalty while wearing heavy armor without taking that penalty.

#### Champion Tier

Two battles per day, avoid all attack penalties for wearing heavy armor from a class that normally has such an attack penalty. During any other battles that day, you can still only use the once-per battle power from the adventurer-tier feat.
