## Fighter Multiclass

You lag one level behind two columns of the [[Compendium/13A/Classes/Fighter|Fighter]] Level Progression Table: Manoeuvres Known and Manoeuvre Pool Available. 

You also won’t get the fighter’s normal bonus talent at 6th level, instead receiving it at 7th level.

As a 1st level multiclass fighter, you start knowing two manoeuvres from the 1st level pool.

### Armoured Warfare

#### Adventurer Tier

Once per battle while wearing heavy armour, use an attack from a [class](Compendium/13A/Character-Rules/Class.md) that normally takes an attack penalty while wearing heavy armour without taking that penalty.

#### Champion Tier

You can now ignore heavy armour attack penalties while the escalation die is 3+.
