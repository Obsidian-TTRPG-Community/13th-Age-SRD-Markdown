## Commander Multiclass

You lag one level behind in the class-specific elements of the [[Compendium/13A/Classes/Commander|Commander]] Level Progression table—so it only affects the number of commands and tactics you have and the pool you can draw them from.

### Many Fronts

#### Adventurer Tier

Once per battle, use a melee attack from your non-commander class in place of a commander attack when you use your Front Line Fighting feature.

#### Champion Tier

You can now use the adventurer-tier feat twice per battle.
