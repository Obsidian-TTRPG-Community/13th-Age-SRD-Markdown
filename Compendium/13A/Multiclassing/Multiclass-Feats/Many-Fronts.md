## Many Fronts

### Adventurer Tier

Once per battle, use a melee attack from your non-commander [class](Compendium/13A/Character-Rules/Class.md) in place of a commander attack when you use your Front Line Fighting  
feature.

### Champion Tier

You can now use the adventurer-tier feat twice per battle.
