## Armored in Life

### Adventurer Tier

Once per battle while wearing heavy armor, use an attack from a [class](Compendium/13A/Character-Rules/Class.md) that normally takes an attack penalty while wearing heavy armor without taking that penalty.

### Champion Tier

Two battles per day, avoid all attack penalties for wearing heavy armor from a class that normally has such an attack penalty. During any other battles that day, you can still only use the once-per battle power from the adventurer-tier feat.
