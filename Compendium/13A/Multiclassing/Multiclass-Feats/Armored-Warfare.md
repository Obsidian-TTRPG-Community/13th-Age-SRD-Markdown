## Armored Warfare

### Adventurer Tier

Once per battle while wearing heavy armor, use an attack from a [class](Compendium/13A/Character-Rules/Class.md) that normally takes an attack penalty while wearing heavy armor without  
taking that penalty.

### Champion Tier

You can now ignore heavy armor attack penalties while the escalation die is 3+.
