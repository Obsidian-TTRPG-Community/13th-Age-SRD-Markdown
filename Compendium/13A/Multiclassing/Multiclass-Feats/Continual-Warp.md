## Continual Warp

### Adventurer Tier

If you have a warp effect already going, drawing the stone from your other [class](Compendium/13A/Character-Rules/Class.md) doesn’t cancel the warp effect. The warp effect continues until it’s replaced by another warp effect or the end of the battle, as usual.

### Champion Tier

If you invested in high weirdness, your high weirdness effects don’t stop when you draw a multiclass stone.
