## Controlled Rage

### Adventurer Tier

You can use powers and attacks from your other [class](Compendium/13A/Character-Rules/Class.md) while raging. You can’t use the extra d20 that [Barbarian](Compendium/13A/Classes/Barbarian.md) Rage gives you while making an attack from the other class, but at least you can slip out of your rage long enough to use a power or attack from your other class.

### Champion Tier

Once per battle while raging, you can use a melee attack from your other class as if it was a barbarian attack, rolling `dice: 2d20` (2d20) for the attack. 

(Examples of possible uses include a [Bard](Compendium/13A/Classes/Bard.md)’s flexible attack battle cries, a commander attack using the Lead from the Front talent that will garner command points, a fighter’s flexible attacks, a ranger’s double melee attack, and so on.)
