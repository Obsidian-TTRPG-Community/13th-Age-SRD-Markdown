## Two-weapon Multiclass

### Adventurer Tier

While you are fighting with two melee weapons, you now gain the benefit of your Two-Weapon Mastery talent and any [feats](Compendium/13A/Character-Rules/Feats/Feats.md) you’ve taken for it even when using attacks from your non-ranger [class](Compendium/13A/Character-Rules/Class.md).

### Adventurer Tier

You can use your Archery ranger talent and any feats you’ve taken for it even when using ranged attacks from your non-ranger class.
