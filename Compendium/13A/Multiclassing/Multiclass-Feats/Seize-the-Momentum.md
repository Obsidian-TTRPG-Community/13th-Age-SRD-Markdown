## Seize the Momentum

### Adventurer Tier

Once per day when you hit with an attack from your non-rogue [class](Compendium/13A/Character-Rules/Class.md), you can gain *momentum* as if you had used a rogue attack.

### Champion Tier

In addition to using the adventurer-tier feat once per day, you can also use it once per battle (so in a four-battle day, you could use it five times).
