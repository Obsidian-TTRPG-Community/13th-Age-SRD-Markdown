## True Flexibility

### Adventurer Tier

Once per battle, as long as both [classes](Compendium/13A/Classes/Classes.md) use flexible attacks for the type of attack you are making, you can choose to roll a flexible attack without deciding which of your two classes it is linked to. Choose from *all* your flexible attacks after you see the result of the roll.

### Champion Tier

You can now use the adventurer-tier feat twice per battle.
