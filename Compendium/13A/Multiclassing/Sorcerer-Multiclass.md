## Sorcerer Multiclass

You lag one level behind in the spells known columns of the [[Compendium/13A/Classes/Sorcerer|Sorcerer]] Level Progression table. 

At 1st level, you know three 1st level spells.

### Diverse Gathering

#### Adventurer Tier

Once per day, you can cast a non-sorcerer spell after you have gathered power. You double the damage of the spell as if it were a sorcerer spell.

#### Champion Tier

You can now also gather power for a non-sorcerer spell as per the adventurer-tier feat once per battle while the [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Sequence/Escalation-Die|escalation die]] is 4+ (so in a four battle day, you could use it up to five times assuming the escalation die allows it).
