## Occultist Multiclass

You gain the focus required to use a serious [[Compendium/13A/Classes/Occultist|occultist]] spell by using your standard action during your turn to set that up. But when you have your occultist focus, you don’t get to use [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Actions/Actions/Actions|actions]] and powers and spells from other [classes](Compendium/13A/Classes/Classes.md).

You lag one level behind in the spells known columns of the Occultist Level Progression table. You also won’t get the occultist’s normal bonus talents at 5th level and 8th level, instead receiving them at 6th level and 9th level.

### Wider Focus

#### Adventurer Tier

Once per battle, you can use a power, spell, or other effect from a different [class](Compendium/13A/Character-Rules/Class.md) while maintaining your occultist focus.
