## Monk Multiclass

A multiclass [[Compendium/13A/Classes/Monk|monk]] does get a +2 [class](Compendium/13A/Character-Rules/Class.md) bonus to three [abilities](Compendium/13A/Character-Rules/Abilities.md), but does not get to use Focus abilities as the other class.

You lag one level behind in the three columns of the Monk Level Progression table: class talents, forms, and ki.

The multiclass monkâ€™s JAB, PUNCH, and KICK attacks damage dice decrease one size just like the WEAPON attacks of all [classes](Compendium/13A/Classes/Classes.md). 

Yes, this means your:  
**JAB** dice are d4s  
**PUNCH** dice are d6s  
**KICK** dice are d8s
