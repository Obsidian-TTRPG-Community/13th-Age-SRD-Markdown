## Rogue Multiclass

You lag one level behind in the Powers Known and Pool Available columns of the [[Compendium/13A/Classes/Rogue|Rogue]] Level Progression table. At 1st level, you know 3 powers, all of them from the 1st level pool.

Combining your Sneak Attack damage with attacks from other [classes](Compendium/13A/Classes/Classes.md) remains off-limits.

### Seize the Momentum

#### Adventurer Tier

Once per day when you hit with an attack from your non-rogue [class](Compendium/13A/Character-Rules/Class.md), you can gain *momentum* as if you had used a rogue attack.

#### Champion Tier

In addition to using the adventurer-tier feat once per day, you can also use it once per battle (so in a four-battle day, you could use it five times).
