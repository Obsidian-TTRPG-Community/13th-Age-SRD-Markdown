## Bard Multiclass

You lag one level behind in the battle cries and spells/songs known columns of the [Bard](Compendium/13A/Classes/Bard.md) Level Progression table. 

As a 1st level bard, you start with only one 1st level battle cry and one 1st level spell or song.

As usual, the Battle Skald or Spellsinger talents could still add a battle cry or spell/song to what you’re getting as a multiclass bard.

Note that the Jack of Spells advantages would only apply to spells jacked by the talent, not to spells known through the multiclass.

If you multiclass with another [class](Compendium/13A/Character-Rules/Class.md) that has [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Attacks/Flexible-Attacks|flexible attacks]], such as the fighter or a druid that takes that talent, consider the two [feats](Compendium/13A/Character-Rules/Feats/Feats.md) that follow. Without the feats, you must always declare whether you are using a bard flexible attack or a flexible attack from your other class.

### True Flexibility

#### Adventurer Tier

Once per battle, as long as both classes use flexible attacks for the type of attack you are making, you can choose to roll a flexible attack without deciding which of your two classes it is linked to. Choose from *all* your flexible attacks after you see the result of the roll.

#### Champion Tier

You can now use the adventurer-tier feat twice per battle.
