          - name: "Natural 18+"
            desc: "The dybbuk gains a fear aura against the target (save ends) as the dybbuk warps its corpse-flesh into a horrifying form. While engaged with the dybbuk, if the scared target has 30 hp or fewer, it’s dazed (–4 attack) and does not add the escalation die to its attacks."

traits:
    - name: "Unholy aversion"
      desc: "When an enemy makes a spell attack or magic weapon attack against the corpse dybbuk that deals holy damage and rolls a natural 18+, the dybbuk leaves its host body. The body drops in place and the corpse dybbuk becomes an undamaged ethereal dybbuk (see that entry). If the escalation die is 3+, reset the escalation die to 2."
    - name: "Warp another’s flesh"
      desc: "Once per battle as a free action, the corpse dybbuk can grant a nearby ally a +2 bonus to attack and damage until the end of the battle. The warped ally takes damage equal to its level each time it uses a standard action to attack. If this ability is expended, the dybbuk regains it when the escalation die reaches 4+."
