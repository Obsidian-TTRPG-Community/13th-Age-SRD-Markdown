Demons (see #13A/Monsters/Factions/Demons ) may or may not have a special demonic ability. Roll a d10 (`dice: 1d10`) for each non-mook normal-sized demon. If you roll less than or equal to the demon’s level, it has a random ability. Large or huge (or double- or triple-strength) demons automatically get one at least one random ability.

When a demon has an ability, roll a d6 (`dice: d6`) or d8 (`dice: d8`) (GM’s choice) on the table below to determine what it is.

| `dice: 1d6` or `dice: 1d8` | Demonic Ability   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1                          | True seeing       | The demon is immune to invisibility and ignores any illusions.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 2                          | Resist fire 18+   | You’ll see that the demon resists fire the first time you use fire against it.                                                                                                                                                              |
| 3                          | Invisibility      | The first time the demon is staggered each battle it becomes invisible until the end of its next turn.                                                                                                                                      |
| 4                          | Resist energy 12+ | The demon’s resistance to all energy types puts a damper on enemy spellcasters, but at least the resistance is only 12+.                                                                                                                    |
| 5                          | Fear aura         | Enemies engaged with the demon who are below its fear hit point threshold are dazed and can’t use the escalation die. See Fear.                                                                                                             |
| 6                          | Teleport          | `dice: 1d3` times per battle, as a move action, the demon can teleport anywhere it can see nearby.                                                                                                                                          |
| 7                          | Demonic speed     | The demon can take an extra action each turn while the escalation die is 4+.                                                                                                                                                                |
| 8                          | Gate              | Once per battle as a standard action, if the demon is staggered, it can summon a single demon ally at least two levels below its own level. The allied demon rolls initiative and does not appear on the battlefield until its turn starts. |
