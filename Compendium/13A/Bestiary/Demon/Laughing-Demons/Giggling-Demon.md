      desc: "These demons torment with their tickling tails. Enemies that disengage from them suffer a cumulative –1 penalty on all checks and attacks until the end of the character’s turn (no maximum penalty)."

      desc: "When building battles with this monster, it only counts a half a normal mook."
nastier_traits:
    - name: "Invisibility"
      desc: "Well, not invisibility pre-se, but more an ability to hide from sight until they choose to reveal themselves. Outside of combat giggling demons can fold themselves up into very small spaces, slide under doors, even slip through cracks in floorboards. Of course, you can still hear them giggling when you suffer a misfortune at their hands."
