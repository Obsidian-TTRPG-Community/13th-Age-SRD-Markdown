## Nastier Specials for All Kroma Dragonics

If youâ€™d like to make your dragonic wyrmspawn more deadly, give them wings and limited flight. Or if your dragonics have the blood of the mighty wyrms flowing through them (or the magic of dragons has worn off on them), consider giving some of them a random dragon ability.

*Limited flight:* At the start of each turn, roll a d6. If the result is less than or equal to the escalation die, the dragonic gains flight as a move action during its turns thanks to a pair of wings it unfurls from its back. The flight tends to be more power-flapping or gliding from one place to another rather than hovering. Flamewings who also have limited flight prefer to use their burning wings to fly in combat wherever possible, resorting to their physical wings only if needed.

*Blood of the wyrm:* This dragonic displays traits of its forebears, the mighty wyrms. Roll a d10 and consult the random dragon ability table, or choose one of the first ten options that looks likely to shape the story or battle.
