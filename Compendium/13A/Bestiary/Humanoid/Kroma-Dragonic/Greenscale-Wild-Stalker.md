traits:
    - name: "Superior camouflage"
      desc: "The wild stalker’s scales naturally change to blend with its surroundings, allowing it to hide in plain sight and making checks to detect it take a –5 penalty. When it attacks from concealment without being seen first, the target is vulnerable to its attack. It can regain its camouflage by moving out of direct sight and hiding (hard DC to spot)."
    - name: "Resist poison 14+"
      desc: "When a poison attack targets this creature, the attacker must roll a natural 14+ on the attack roll or it only deals half damage."
