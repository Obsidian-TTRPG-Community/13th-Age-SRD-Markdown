      traits:

traits:
    - name: "Death curse"
      desc: "Each hag can lay a curse upon the one who ends its horrible life. After dropping to 0 hit points, a hag always lingers long enough to pronounce the words of the curse. (See Death Curses.)"
    - name: "Delusionist"
      desc: "All hags have the ability to twist the perceptions of others. If the hag has a short time to prepare, it can hide a small hut, disguise a volunteer or captive as a monster, disguise itself as a harmless peasant woman, etc. A DC 30 skill check is required to overcome the delusion and see the truth of it (if a player gives a reason for not trusting what their character sees; perhaps add subtle clues toward that end). The magic fades as soon as the hag enters combat."
    - name: "Fear"
      desc: "While engaged with this creature, enemies with 30 hp or fewer are dazed (–4 attack) and do not add the escalation die to their attacks."
