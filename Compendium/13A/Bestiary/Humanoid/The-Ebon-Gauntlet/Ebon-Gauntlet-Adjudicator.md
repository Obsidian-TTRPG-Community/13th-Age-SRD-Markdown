traits:
    - name: "Trollish regeneration 10"
      desc: "While an adjudicator is damaged, its glyphed flesh heals 10 hit points at the start of the adjudicator’s turn. It can regenerate five times per battle. If it heals to its maximum hit points, then that use of regeneration doesn’t count against the five-use limit. When the adjudicator is hit by an attack that deals acid or force damage, it loses one use of its regeneration, and it can’t regenerate during its next turn. Dropping an adjudicator to 0 hp doesn’t kill it if it has any uses of regeneration left."
