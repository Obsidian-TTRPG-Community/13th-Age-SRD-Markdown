## Standard Powers for All Nymphs

*Domain bound:* Nymphs are tied to an area of land or water. Land areas will be at most a couple miles wide; water areas might be much larger. As a rule, nymphs can’t leave the area they’re bound to.

*Limited immortality:* A nymph that drops to 0 hit points or is otherwise slain will eventually return to life in its domain, so long as its domain and its secret survives. After an hour, a nymph needs a hard save to return to life. After eight hours, a nymph needs a normal save to return to life. If the nymph has still not returned, roll an easy save at the end of each 24 hours until the nymph succeeds.

*Note on types:* 
- The following nymphs with the humanoid type probably remember themselves. 
- Nymphs that have probably forgotten their original selves have the elemental type.
