traits:
    - name: "Summon ghouls"
      desc: "The jackal high priest starts each battle accompanied by a mob of 1d6 + 1 10th level greater summoned ghoul mooks. (The mooks gained via this ability are accounted for in the building battle math by the jackal priest’s designation as a double-strength monster.) At the start of each of the jackal priest’s turns, (whether or not the jackal high priest is engaged!) roll a d6. If you roll less than or equal to the escalation die, use the jackal priest’s standard action to add another mob of 1d6 + 1 greater summoned ghoul mooks to the battle. The newly summoned mooks take their turn after the jackal high priest’s turn. Stop rolling the d6 after the ability has triggered to summon the second mob of ghoul mooks."
