## Ability for all fauns - destiny

Fauns who are likely to end up in a fight choose one of two paths. The paths determine which of their defenses will be higher, and in some cases determine an additional ability or two.

*Path of the Sword:* More martial-minded, these fauns are usually warriors, thieves, and hunters. They have a higher Physical Defense (PD).

*Path of Song:* Magically-inclined, these fauns are usually bards, magicians, priests, or druids. They have a higher Mental Defense (MD).
