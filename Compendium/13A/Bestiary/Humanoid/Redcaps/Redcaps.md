All redcaps have special abilities based on *The Bad Word*. 

Before every battle against redcaps, the GM should determine the *bad word* for that battle. Whenever a PC or a player at the table says the word, every redcap in the battle can use their associated ability as a free action that interrupts whatever action is currently happening.
