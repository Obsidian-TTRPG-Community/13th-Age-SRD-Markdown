traits:
    - name: "Hidden guardian"
      desc: "If a spriggan wants to stay hidden in an illusory form instead of joining a battle, roll initiative for the spriggan as normal. When the spriggan “acts,” by doing nothing, have the most perceptive PC roll a DC 25 Wisdom check, adding +1 for each of their allies in the fight. On a success, the spriggan’s illusion is pierced and the spriggan can use a single move action during its turn, but nothing else—it burned its standard action trying to stay hidden."
    - name: "Embiggen"
      desc: "When the escalation die reaches 2, the spriggan grows in size as a free action, acquiring its _giant-sized slap_ attack. Note that as a free action, this transformation can take place any time, usually at the start of a round. If the spriggan was using its _hidden guardian_ ability, it’s not hidden anymore!"
