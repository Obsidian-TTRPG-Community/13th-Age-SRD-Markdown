            desc: "The target’s flesh begins to rot and the ongoing damage increases by +40 (cumulative). Saves granted by special powers don’t increase this damage if they fail, only end of turn failures."

traits:
    - name: "Mortal terror"
      desc: "The presence of a mummy unnerves opponents, giving it an unusual fear aura. While engaged with this creature, enemies that have 200 hp or fewer are dazed (–4 attack) and do not add the escalation die to their attacks. Each time an enemy with 200 hp or fewer attacks the mummy, hit or miss, it must roll a save. On a success, it’s no longer affected by the fear aura effects of any mummy in the battle."
    - name: "Spiritual grit"
      desc: "When the mummy takes 20 damage or less from a non-fire attack, it takes no damage instead."

      desc: "The mummy has a +4 bonus to all defences until it takes damage."
    - name: "Bone-chilling cry"
      desc: "Once per battle as a quick action, the mummy can issue a bone-chilling cry that seems to echo from some unseen tomb or portal and it makes a call of the sarcophagus attack."
