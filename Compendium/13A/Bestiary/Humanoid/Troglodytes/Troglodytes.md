## For All Troglodytes

*Trog stench:* Trogs spray scents that stink so badly that other humanoids take penalties to all attacks, defences, and saves when engaged with a troglodyte or when nearby three or more troglodytes. Non-humanoids aren’t affected.  

Humanoids affected by *trog stench* can make a normal save (with a penalty) at the end of each of their turns. If the save succeeds, the humanoid can ignore all *trog stench* for the rest of the battle. 

*Trog stench* penalties vary for different humanoid races:

| Race | Save Penalty |
| --- | --- |
| Elves, gnolls, gnomes | –4 |
| Humans, halflings, half-elves, holy ones, tieflings, almost everyone else | –3 |
| Half-orcs, dragonics | –2 |
| Dwarves | –1 |
| Forgeborn | 0 |
