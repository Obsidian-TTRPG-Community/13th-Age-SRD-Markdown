traits:
    - name: "Earth’s embrace"
      desc: "Once per battle as a move action, the oread can pull one creature currently overcome by its _hard words_ attack under the ground into an embrace with a part of its consciousness. The oread’s physical form remains above ground and continues to battle. The target remains underground, taking no actions except to bond with the oread and telepathically reveal its secrets to the oread until it saves. While underground, it can’t be seen or targeted by allies. Saving from being overcome releases the target from underground."
