Make a _willowy words_ attack against each creature that can hear the dryad. On a hit, instead of being confused, the target is charmed (as per the charm person spell). It then considers the dryad a friend. Creatures missed by the attack only notice the charm attempt if it misses by 4 or more. A dryad can attempt to charm a creature only once per day."
