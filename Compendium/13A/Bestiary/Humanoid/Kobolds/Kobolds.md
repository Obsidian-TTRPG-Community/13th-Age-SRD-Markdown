All kobolds have the *trapster* ability. When a kobold makes a *trapster* attack and rolls a natural attack roll that is higher than the target’s Wisdom, the creature has maneuvered the target into a trap with the attack. A creature can only be subjected to one trap per round.

When a kobold triggers its *trapster* ability, determine the damage the trap deals by rolling a 1d4, then adding the escalation die. If there’s a dungeon-shaman in the battle, use a d8 instead of a d4.

Kobold traps can deal ongoing damage to the target instead of regular damage, if that makes sense for the trap. For ongoing damage, roll 1d4 (or 1d8) plus the escalation die, and then subtract one (minimum 1).

Kobold traps can impose conditions upon the target, if you choose. Roll normal trap damage, but the trap only deals half damage (minimum 1). Then roll a d4 for the condition the trap imposes upon the target until the end of its next turn.

1.  The target is stuck.
2.  The target is hampered.
3.  The target is dazed.
4.  The target is vulnerable.

Trap types vary according to the location/terrain and the whim of the GM.
