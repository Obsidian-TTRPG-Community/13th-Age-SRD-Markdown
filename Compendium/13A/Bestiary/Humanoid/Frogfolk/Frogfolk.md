## Special Abilities for All Frogspawn

You should certainly use one ability per frogspawn, occasionally two. For frogspawn mooks, treat the abilities as usable once per battle.

*Disgusting tongue:* The frogspawn deals poison damage equal to its level to any character that pops free of it or successfully disengages from it. (Teleporting away is probably tongue-free unless the GM is hopping mad.)

*Dunk and cover:* If the battle is taking place in a swamp, lake, or river, whenever the frogspawn misses with a natural even attack roll, it can duck out of sight. Remove the frogspawn from the table until the start of its next turn. At the start of its next turn, place it anywhere nearby its previous location, but not engaged with an enemy.

*Erratic leap (move action):* If the frogspawn is unengaged at the start of its turn, choose a random nearby enemy the frogspawn can see. The frogspawn leaps into engagement with that enemy and its crit range with melee attacks expands by 3 until the end of the turn.

*Paranoid destroyer:* This frogspawn can’t be surprised. If there’s a surprise round, it gets to act. If there isn’t a surprise round at the start of combat, the frogspawn gets a surprise round if its natural initiative roll is 16+. On the down side, subtract 2 from this frogspawn’s MD, because it’s always sure it’s going to die. 

>[!warning] **Gamemaster**: Don’t give this ability to all the frogspawn in a battle. Just one or two.
