Outside battle they can coat objects with a skin-contact poison—10 poison damage and 10 ongoing poison damage (save ends, or hard save if the target ingests the poison)."
    - name: "Disguise"
      desc: "Frogspawn deceivers are experts at disguising themselves as other less froggy races, it requires a DC 25 skill check to see the truth beneath their veils or deep cloaks and lifelike masks. Once they attack what they are becomes obvious."
    - name: "Jump"
      desc: "These froggy assassins can jump huge distances. When the escalation die is even frogspawn deceivers can jump as a quick action, leaping over enemies and past obstacles in a way that can’t be intercepted and that doesn’t provoke attacks."
