traits:
    - name: "Croaking chorus"
      desc: "At the start of each round, all spellcroakers in a battle start to croak together in chorus. This imposes a special bonus or penalty depending on the croak generated by the chorus that round (roll 1d6)."
    - name: "1-2: Croak of Dismay"
      desc: "If the number of spellcroakers is equal to or greater than the value of the escalation die, then the player characters do not get the benefit of the escalation die, but all frogs and frogfolk may add the value of the escalation die to their attack rolls instead."
    - name: "3–4: Croak of Victory"
      desc: "All attacks by frogfolk gain a bonus to damage equal to the number of croakers."
    - name: "5-6: Croak of Choking"
      desc: "Over the course of the round, you may force the player characters to reroll a number of d20 rolls (attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, death saves) equal to the number of croakers."
nastier_traits:
    - name: "Croakmaster"
      desc: "This spellcroaker counts as two spellcroakers for the purposes of the _croaking chorus_."
    - name: "Frog Curse"
      desc: "If a spellcroaker rolls a natural 18+ when using a curse, the target is transformed into a steadily shrinking frog-like humanoid and is hampered and weakened (save ends all effects). If the curse somehow ran its full course, the target would no doubt shrink down into a frog, but PCs are made of strong stuff and should be able to evade a fate that might affect common folk."
triggered_actions:
    - name: "When a spellcroaker drops to 0 hit points, roll a d20"
      desc: "on a 11+, the remaining spellcroakers maintain the _croaking chorus_ for the rest of the round. Otherwise, the chorus effect is cancelled for the rest of that round."
