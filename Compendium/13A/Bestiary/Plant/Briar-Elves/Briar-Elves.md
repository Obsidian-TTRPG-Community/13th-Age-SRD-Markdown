## Environmental Effects

Before the battle, roll a `dice: 1d4` to determine which environmental effect will show up during the fight. Then roll a `dice: 1d3` for the minimum escalation die value that triggers the effect at the start of the round and stays in effect the rest of the battle.

In the unlikely event that PCs have managed to find or lure briar elves outside the briar elf’s forested places of power, these effects probably wouldn’t apply.

## Plant Briar Elves

**1. Grasping grasses**—Disengage checks by non-plant creatures and non-briar elves take a –5 penalty.

**2. Cutting leaves**—Adventurers must save (11+) when they move or take damage equal to twice their level.

**3. Crushing vines**—Any adventurer who doesn’t move on their turn takes their level in damage.

**4. Thorny plants**—Each time an adventurer becomes staggered they also take damage equal to their level times the escalation die value.
