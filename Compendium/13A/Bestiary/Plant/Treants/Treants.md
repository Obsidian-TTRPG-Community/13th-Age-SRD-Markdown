All treants except awakened tress have the *demolish* ability.

*Free-form ability — Demolish:* Given time, treants are capable of pulling apart just about anything that’s been put together. Their roots squeeze into spaces between paving stones, slowly pulling them up and out of place. Their branches can likewise worm their way into spaces in walls, doors, and gates, and with steady pressure they can pull down most human-made structures. This slow-motion destruction takes minutes for the simplest efforts and hours for major demolition.
