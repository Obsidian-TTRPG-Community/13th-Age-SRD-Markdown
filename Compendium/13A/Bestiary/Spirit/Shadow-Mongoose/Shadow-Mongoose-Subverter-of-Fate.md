    - name: "Cloud of claws +11 vs. AC"
      desc: "18 damage"
      traits:
          - name: "Natural even hit"
            desc: "1d12 damage to a nearby target not engaged with the shadow mongoose."
    - name: "Subversion of fate +11 vs. MD (one target that has been hit twice by the shadow mongoose this battle)"
      desc: "The shadow mongoose steals the escalation die until the end of its next turn. While the escalation die is stolen, all shadow mongooses and their allies use it, and the adventurers do not."
      traits:
          - name: "Crit"
            desc: "…and the shadow mongoose steals an aspect belonging to the target. The target might lose their age, or lose part of their appearance, or an outward personality quirk. The character’s race, class, attributes etc. remain intact, as does their core personality and their memories."
traits:
    - name: "Quick use"
      desc: "1/round, as a quick action."
    - name: "Shadow’s flight"
      desc: "The shadow mongoose may become a thing of dark smoke and shadow, flying swiftly through the air or through the smallest cracks."
    - name: "Play dead"
      desc: "Once per battle the shadow mongoose may fake being dead. Only magical senses and a DC 30 skill roll from the PC who struck the ‘killing blow’ will detect that the creature is still alive. Shadow mongooses like to fake their deaths so that they can escape battle with their stolen icon relationships. Since shadow anatomy isn’t entirely biological, this ability functions like fleeing the battle if it succeeds, the PCs can go ahead and blast away at what they think is the corpse, but they’ll be fragging the mongoose’s shadows, not the mongoose itself."
    - name: "Trader"
      desc: "The shadow mongoose can change shape, though not mid-battle. Shadow mongoose subverters sometimes take on non-shadowy visages so that they can set up shop as traders, offering to take aspects that others do not want, or selling stolen or traded aspects to those that do desire them."
    - name: "Shadow fate"
      desc: "When the shadow mongoose dies all the aspects that it stole return to their owners. Stolen aspects that have been traded away also return, but slowly. The person who killed the shadow mongoose gains a random aspect chosen by the GM."
nastier_traits:
    - name: "Drop the loot"
      desc: "The shadow mongoose flees the battle. One nearby enemy of the shadow mongoose gains an unwanted aspect. This new unwanted aspect is temporary, lasting only until the end of the next game session."
    - name: "Shadow dancer"
      desc: "If the shadow mongoose doesn’t attack on its turn it can turn into a flat shadow, and cannot be intercepted or attacked it is moving in this form. When it returns to its normal form, it deals double damage with its next attack, hit or miss."
