      traits:
          - name: "Natural even hit"
            desc: "After the current battle is over, the next time this day that the target takes ongoing damage, the shadow mongoose gets to make a _destruction of fate_ attack against the target.<br/>[Triggered action]R: Destruction of fate +9 vs. MD (one target that has been hit twice by the shadow mongoose this battle)—The target rolls their icon dice, and any that come up 1-4 the shadow mongoose steals until the end of the day. At the start of the next day the target rolls a save (11+) for each stolen icon relationship, on a success the icon relationship die returns to them."
          - name: "Crit"
            desc: "…and the shadow mongoose steals an item belonging to the target, preferably a magic one but sometimes the most vital one (a key, a map)."
traits:
    - name: "Shadow’s slide"
      desc: "The shadow mongoose can move over any solid surface, slithering like a shadow."
    - name: "Play dead"
      desc: "Once per battle the shadow mongoose may fake being dead. Only magical senses and a DC 25 skill roll from the PC who struck the ‘killing blow’ will detect that the creature is still alive. Shadow mongooses like to fake their deaths so that they can escape battle with their stolen icon relationships. Since shadow anatomy isn’t entirely biological, this ability functions like fleeing the battle if it succeeds, the PCs can go ahead and blast away at what they think is the corpse, but they’ll be fragging the mongoose’s shadows, not the mongoose itself."
    - name: "Trapper"
      desc: "The shadow mongoose can change shape, though not mid-battle. Shadow mongoose destroyers of fate use this ability to seem innocuous until they are ready to strike."
    - name: "Shadow fate"
      desc: "When the shadow mongoose dies all the icon relationship dice that it stole return to their owners. The person who killed the shadow mongoose gains a magic item that the shadow mongoose had stolen (though maybe not one that it had stolen from the party)."
nastier_traits:
    - name: "Drop the loot"
      desc: "The shadow mongoose flees the battle. One nearby enemy of the shadow mongoose has their icon relationships flip positive to negative and vise-versa (conflicted relationships are unaffected). This relationship inversion is temporary, lasting only until the end of the next game session."
    - name: "Shadow dancer"
      desc: "If the shadow mongoose doesn’t attack on its turn it can turn into a flat shadow, and cannot be intercepted or attacked it is moving in this form. When it returns to its normal form, it deals double damage with its next attack, hit or miss."
