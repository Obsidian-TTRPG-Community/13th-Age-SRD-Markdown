      desc: "The first creature the eidolon hits with an attack each battle must start making last gasp saves. After the fourth failure, the target fades away from reality—they are not dead, just gone. Erased. The eidolon can bring them back at will, another eidolon might also be able to retrieve them, and a quest by the adventurers to another realm might retrieve them."
