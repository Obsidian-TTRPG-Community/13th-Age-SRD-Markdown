## Eidolon Specific Rules

As a free action each round, an eidolon can use one of the three following abilities, which to them are as natural as breathing is to mortals. (GMs, due to these special abilities, eidolons are especially deadly when they have allies.) When including eidolons in battles, you don’t need to (and probably shouldn’t!) use these abilities all the time; they’re better as a nasty surprise.

*Split reality:* The eidolon splits the party into different realities. Each player rolls a d4 for their character. That PC can only perceive and interact with the eidolon and with other characters who rolled the same number. That means PCs in different realities can’t communicate or affect each other in any way. For the rest of the battle, each player rolls a d4 at the start of the round to see which reality their character is now in. At the start of each round, the eidolon can choose which version(s) of reality its allies are in.

*Warp time:* At the start of each round two combatants swap places in the initiative order as determined by the eidolon. Alternately, the eidolon warps the momentum of the battle and the escalation die value is determined at the start of the round with a d6 roll.

*Reshuffle space:* The eidolon swaps the position of two creatures in the battle at the start of the round. Alternately, if you are using minis and some sort of map tiles you can rearrange the tiles with the minis still on them.

Finally, all eidolons have the following ability, which plays well with the “recurring enemy” story.

*Undying:* When an eidolon drops to 0 hp it becomes discorporate. The eidolon isn’t dead, just gone. It has lost its link to or focus upon the time and place where the adventurers are. If adventurers drive off an eidolon repeatedly it will probably just stay away. Eidolons can be vindictive and hold grudges, but they have many possible worlds to interact with and if a mortal proves too troublesome the eidolon will move on. In general eidolons need defeating on three separate occasions to convince them to stay away forever.

## The Iconic Eidolon

While guardian-form eidolons seem attracted to the service of the Religious Icon, eidolons can end up allied with any icon that serves the same interests as they do.

Eidolons who act in the interests of an icon have unusual weaknesses and strengths related to that icon, eidolons usually call icon-related oddities ‘iconic tests’. How much of these icon-related ‘tests’ are due to the eidolons being mythically linked to an icon and how much is a role that the eidolon is playing is left to you as the GM to decide.

Eidolons usually go out of their way to reveal any weaknesses they have as part of their ‘test’ of mortals. 

**Magic Icon**—Wizard spells do double damage against the eidolon (crits do triple). Wizard spells used creatively against the eidolon have additional effects depending on the whim of the GM. 

**Zealous Icon**—The eidolons’ attacks do double damage against those who have positive relationships with the Demonic Icon and sorcerers with the infernal heritage talent.

**Demonic Icon**—If you are willing to owe a mystically-enforced favor to the Demonic Icon, you can make this eidolon weakened (–4 attack and defences) until the end of your turn.

**Underground Icon**—The eidolon does double damage against those using magical items, unless they have recently tithed to the Underground Icon.

**Graceful Icon**—The eidolon takes double damage from attacks made by bards, and attacks made using bows (but not from crossbows, which do their normal damage).

**Leader Icon**—Adventurers who fight side-by-side with each other (or back-to-back) gain +2 to all their defences while doing so.

**Protector Icon**—Attacks by dragonics, breath weapons, and attacks from sorcerers with the metallic protector heritage talent deal double damage to this eidolon.

**Nature Icon**—The eidolon takes double damage from animal companions, and from druids in beast form. Plants near this eidolon grow more verdantly, flowers blooming in its presence.

**Undead Icon**—Spend a recovery to weaken (–4 attack and defense) the eidolon until the end of your turn. Well, we say ‘spend’ but what you are actually doing is sacrificing a sliver of your life-energy to the Undead Icon.

**Brute Icon**—If the attacker subtracts a die from their damage dice before rolling them, it takes double damage. The extra die of damage must be used to harm something or somebody relating to cities or civilization (instead of rolling 3d8 damage you’d roll `dice: 2d8*2` damage, and deal `dice: 1d8` damage to a window, book, mayor, etc.). The GM and player should work together to determine what a ‘die of damage’ means to whatever is getting smashed or slashed as part of the attack.

**Religious Icon**—If since the start of the Eidolon’s last turn, any adventurer has received healing from somebody who has a positive or conflicted relationship with the Religious Icon, then the Eidolon is dazed (–4 attack) until the end of its next turn.

**Trickster Icon**—Sneak attack damage dice for attacks against this eidolon are two die types higher (1d4 becomes 1d8, 2d6 becomes 2d10, etc.). Rogues can shadow walk without needing to make a roll first.

**Draconic Icon**—This eidolon takes double damage from poison, lightning, or fire attacks, as well as from attacks from sorcerers with the chromatic destroyer heritage talent deal double damage to this eidolon.
