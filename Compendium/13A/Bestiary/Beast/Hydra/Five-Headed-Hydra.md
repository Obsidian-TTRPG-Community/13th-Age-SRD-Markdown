      traits:
          - name: "Natural even hit or miss"
            desc: "The hydra’s next gnashing teeth attack, if it has an attack left this turn, can be against any nearby enemy instead of against a creature engaged with it."

traits:
    - name: "Too tough to trick: Whenever the hydra would suffer any of the following conditions, it ignores the condition and takes 5 damage instead"
      desc: "Confused, dazed, hampered, stunned, or weakened."
    - name: "Roiling swirl"
      desc: "If the hydra has at least two gnashing teeth attacks left during a turn, it can expend one of those attacks to move to engage a nearby enemy as a free action (but it will take opportunity attacks for doing so)."
    - name: "Sprout sixth head"
      desc: "The first time the hydra is staggered, as a free action it gains 40 hit points and a sixth gnashing teeth attack, and is considered undamaged at its new hit point total. Using the hydra’s current hit points as a new baseline, the hydra will be staggered again when it drops below 50% of that total."
    - name: "Sprout seventh head"
      desc: "The second time the hydra is staggered, as a free action it gains 40 hit points and a seventh gnashing teeth attack, etc. Use a new hit point baseline as before, but there is no eighth head waiting to sprout."
