In addition to their standard abilities, all elder couatls and some 8<sup>th</sup> level couatls have another ability or attack (sometimes even two) that flows from the power of the icon or icons they are presently associated with. Memory keeper couatls who are associated with icons that no longer exist should be given whichever ability or attack that seems right. Alternatively, make up a new ability/attack that suits the former icon you’ve created.

Here are some Icon-centered abilities:

| Zealous Icon                                                                                                      | The couatl gains a +1 bonus to AC and PD. In addition, all the couatl’s melee attacks deal half damage when they miss.                                                                                                                               |
| Demonic Icon                                                                                                      | Roll a d6 and a d8 on the Demon Ability table. If you get the same result, reroll the d8 until you have two different demonic abilities for the couatl.                                                                                              |
| Underground Icon                                                                                                  | Secretly roll a d6 at the start of each battle. If the roll is odd, the PCs can’t use any of their magic items’ powers when the escalation die is odd this battle. If the roll is even, the PCs can’t use their magic items’ powers when the escalation die is even this battle. Default chakra bonuses still function, but powers don’t. And for the fun of it, once they’ve been powered off for a turn, all the PCs’ magic items will be freaking out and creating roleplaying havoc by forcing their quirks to the forefront for the rest of the battle.                                               |
| Graceful Icon                                                                                                     | At the start of each battle, the couatl gains 1d4 powers of its choice from this list:<br>- Cruel: Once per battle, deal ongoing damage to a target you hit with a natural even attack roll as a free action. The ongoing damage equals 5 times your level. As usual, a normal save (11+) ends the damage. A critical hit doesn’t double this ongoing damage.<br>- Highblood Teleport: Once per battle as a move action, place yourself in a nearby location you can see.<br>- Elven Grace: At the start of each of your turns, roll a die to see if you get an extra standard action. If your roll is equal to or lower than the escalation die, you get an extra standard action that turn. At the start of battle, you roll a d6. Each time you successfully gain an extra action, the size of the die you roll increases by one step on the following progression: (d4), d6, d8, d10, d12, d20. If you get an extra action after rolling a d20, you can’t get any more extra actions that battle.<br>- Surprising: Once per battle, subtract one from the natural result of one of your own d20 rolls. |
| Leader Icon                                                                                                       | The couatl gains a +4 bonus to MD. It also gains a +2 bonus to attacks and to all defences against each PC who has one or more icon relationship points with the Undead or Brute Icons.                                                                 |
| Protector Icon                                                                                                    | The couatl gains a +1 bonus to attacks and to all defences against each PC who has one or more icon relationship points with the Demonic or Draconic Icons.

| Nature Icon                                                                                                       | The couatl gains a +2 bonus to attacks and to all defences against each PC who has one or more icon relationship points with the Magic or Leader Icons. In addition, the couatl regenerates 10% of its maximum hit points at the start of its turn when the escalation die is even and it has taken damage.                                                                                      |
