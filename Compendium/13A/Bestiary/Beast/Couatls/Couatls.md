In addition to their standard abilities, all elder couatls and some 8<sup>th</sup> level couatls have another ability or attack (sometimes even two) that flows from the power of the icon or icons they are presently associated with. Memory keeper couatls who are associated with icons that no longer exist should be given whichever ability or attack that seems right. Alternatively, make up a new ability/attack that suits the former icon you’ve created.

Here are some Icon-centered abilities:

| Icon-centered Abilities |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Magic Icon<br>8th level<br>C: Striking comets +13 vs. PD (each nearby creature) — 40 damage<br> Natural even miss: The target is dazed (save ends).<br> Natural odd miss: 20 damage.<br> Limited use: 1/battle, when the escalation die is 2+.<br>11th level<br>C: Comet strike +17 vs. PD (each nearby creature) — 70 damage<br> Natural even miss: The target is weakened (save ends).<br> Natural odd miss: 35 damage.<br> Limited use: 1/battle, when the escalation die is 2+.  |
| **Zealous Icon**<br>The couatl gains a +1 bonus to AC and PD. In addition, all the couatl’s melee attacks deal half damage when they miss.|
| **Demonic Icon**<br>Roll a d6 and a d8 on the Demon Ability table. If you get the same result, reroll the d8 until you have two different demonic abilities for the couatl. |
| **Underground Icon**<br>Secretly roll a d6 at the start of each battle. If the roll is odd, the PCs can’t use any of their magic items’ powers when the escalation die is odd this battle. If the roll is even, the PCs can’t use their magic items’ powers when the escalation die is even this battle. Default chakra bonuses still function, but powers don’t. And for the fun of it, once they’ve been powered off for a turn, all the PCs’ magic items will be freaking out and creating roleplaying havoc by forcing their quirks to the forefront for the rest of the battle. |
| **Graceful Icon**<br>At the start of each battle, the couatl gains 1d4 powers of its choice from this list:<br>Cruel: Once per battle, deal ongoing damage to a target you hit with a natural even attack roll as a free action. The ongoing damage equals 5 times your level. As usual, a normal save (11+) ends the damage. A critical hit doesn’t double this ongoing damage.<br>Highblood Teleport: Once per battle as a move action, place yourself in a nearby location you can see.<br>Elven Grace: At the start of each of your turns, roll a die to see if you get an extra standard action. If your roll is equal to or lower than the escalation die, you get an extra standard action that turn. At the start of battle, you roll a d6. Each time you successfully gain an extra action, the size of the die you roll increases by one step on the following progression: (d4), d6, d8, d10, d12, d20. If you get an extra action after rolling a d20, you can’t get any more extra actions that battle.<br>Surprising: Once per battle, subtract one from the natural result of one of your own d20 rolls. |
| **Leader Icon**<br>The couatl gains a +4 bonus to MD. It also gains a +2 bonus to attacks and to all defences against each PC who has one or more icon relationship points with the Undead or Brute Icons. |
| **Protector Icon**<br>The couatl gains a +1 bonus to attacks and to all defences against each PC who has one or more icon relationship points with the Demonic or Draconic Icons. In addition, the couatl can use the following attack once per battle.<br>8th level<br>C: Golden dragon breath +13 vs. PD (2d4 nearby enemies) — 50 fire damage<br> Miss: Half damage.<br>11th level<br>C: Golden dragon breath +17 vs. PD (2d4 nearby enemies) — 90 fire damage<br> Miss: Half damage.|
| **Nature Icon**<br>The couatl gains a +2 bonus to attacks and to all defences against each PC who has one or more icon relationship points with the Magic or Leader Icons. In addition, the couatl regenerates 10% of its maximum hit points at the start of its turn when the escalation die is even and it has taken damage.|
| **Undead Icon**<br>The couatl gains a +2 bonus to attacks and to all defences against each PC who has one or more icon relationship points with the Leader Icon. In addition, all PCs take a –4 penalty to death saves this battle.|
| **Brute Icon**<br>The couatl gains a +4 bonus to PD. It also gains a +2 bonus to attacks and to all defences against each PC who has one or more icon relationship points with the Underground or Graceful Icon. |
| **Religious Icon**<br>8th level<br>C: Visions of a higher plane +13 vs. MD (1d3 nearby enemies) — 30 psychic damage<br> Natural even hit: The target is confused (save ends).<br> Natural odd hit: The target treats the escalation die as if it was 0 (not in effect) for its attacks and effects (save ends).<br>11th level<br>C: Visions of a higher plane +17 vs. MD (1d4 nearby enemies) — 50 psychic damage<br> Natural even hit: The target is confused (save ends).<br> Natural odd hit: The target treats the escalation die as if it was 0 (not in effect) for its attacks and effects (save ends). |
| **Draconic Icon**<br>Intermittent dragon breath: A couatl can use dragon breath 1d3 times per battle, but never two turns in a row. The couatl’s personal relationship with the Draconic Icon determines whether the damage is acid, fire, or lightning.<br>8th level<br>C: Dragon breath +13 vs. PD (2d3 nearby enemies) — 36 [energy] damage<br> Miss: Half damage.<br>11th level<br>C: Dragon breath +17 vs. PD (2d3 nearby enemies) — 70 [energy] damage<br> Miss: Half damage.|
