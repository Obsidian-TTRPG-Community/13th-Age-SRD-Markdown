Each werebeast can take one of three forms as a quick action once per round: A humanoid form, a beast form, or a hybrid form that combines the two. The hybrid form is the most powerful in combat, but the humanoid and beast forms are useful for various activities outside of combat as well.

The stats below work for the beast and hybrid forms. If a werebeast ends up fighting in humanoid form, subtract 2 from all its defences and halve its normal attack damage.

## The following Powers Are Common for Werebeasts

*Beast heart (all three forms):* Animals of the werebeast’s type are intuitively on good terms with the were, even dire animals. If the werebeast betrays them, however, retaliation is certain and merciless.

*Cursed bite (hybrid or animal form only):* While the moon is full, the first time each battle a creature takes damage from a werebeast melee attack, it takes 10 extra damage (champion: 20 damage; epic: 40 damage). The malignant curse, transmitted through the attack, shocks the mortal flesh. Further attacks, even from weres of different types, don’t cause extra damage. Unless blessed, purged, or otherwise cured, the damaged creature will turn into a werebeast on the night of the next full moon. Heroes powerful enough to fight werebeasts can usually find benefactors or rituals to cure them, but there’s an exception to every rule. GM, if you’re unsure whether it’s a full moon, roll a d10. On a 1–3, the moon is full enough.

*Resilient shifting (all three forms):* As mentioned above, a werebeast can shift forms once per round as a quick action. When a werebeast shifts, it can roll a save against one save ends effect.

## Nastier Specials for All Werebeasts

The following ability is extremely nasty when combined with the *bestial fury* most werebeasts have. It’s possibly better used as a story option, a consequence of a problem with a skill check or an icon relationship, or a situation that should have been avoided and may require sacrifices to deal with:

*Moon fury (hybrid form only):* While fighting in moonlight, a werebeast gains a bonus to damage equal to its level (champion: double its level; epic: triple it).
