    - name: "Blood-frenzy escalator"
      desc: "While at least one creature in the battle is staggered or unconscious, the bulette gains a bonus to its attacks and damage equal to the escalation die. Creatures that have no blood (constructs, oozes, plant creatures, etc.) don’t trigger this ability."
    - name: "Earth surge"
      desc: "Whenever the bumoorah takes damage from an attack, it rolls a save; on a 16+ it can immediately dive beneath the ground, preventing further attacks against it until it surfaces at the start of its next turn. Force attacks and opportunity attacks don’t trigger this ability."
    - name: "Serious burrower"
      desc: "The bumoorah can burrow incredibly quickly for short distances. Bumoorahs are renowned for the dust-spurts and vibrating sound they generate as they shoot through the ground like hungry spears."
