traits:
    - name: "Arcane mirror"
      desc: "When an enemy targets the manafang naga with a spell, the naga regains the use of _force missiles_ if it’s expended. In addition, if that spell is a recharge spell, roll its recharge check immediately after the spell is cast. If the spell is a per-battle or daily spell, roll a hard save (16+) immediately after the spell is cast; on a success, the spellcaster doesn’t expend the spell."
    - name: "Mystic escalator"
      desc: "The naga and each of its nearby allies can use the escalation die unless the naga has been targeted by an enemy’s spell since its last turn."
nastier_traits:
    - name: "Arcane balance"
      desc: "Whenever the naga rolls a natural 1–5 with an attack roll, it can cancel one magical effect created by a spell or magic item that is affecting the naga or a nearby creature (including beneficial effect on a PC). It can be an ongoing effect, an effect that only lasts a round, or even an effect that was supposed to last until the end of the battle. Use your sense of what is magical and what isn’t: a bard’s song is clearly magical, but a rogue’s Shadow Walk talent probably isn’t, despite the wizard’s arguments that it *should* be."
