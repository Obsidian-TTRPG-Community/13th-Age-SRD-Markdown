## Nastier Special for all Naga

*Arcane balance:* Whenever the naga rolls a natural 1–5 with an attack roll, it can cancel one magical effect created by a spell or magic item that is affecting the naga or a nearby creature (including beneficial effect on a PC). It can be an ongoing effect, an effect that only lasts a round, or even an effect that was supposed to last until the end of the battle. Use your sense of what is magical and what isn’t: a bard’s song is clearly magical, but a rogue’s Shadow Walk talent probably isn’t, despite the wizard’s arguments that it *should* be.
