Due to the horned azinth’s ability to move about undetected, it’s likely that the adventurers are going to run into trouble with them by accidentally wandering into the midst of a herd. If that happens, the horned azinth will ambush the heroes. Use this variant on the standard ambush and surprise rules.

First, `dice: 1d3 + 1` horned azinth get to act before initiative is rolled instead of only two of the beasts. Second, if you normally advance the escalation die at the end of the surprise round, don’t do it. The azinth are too well concealed for momentum to favor the heroes.
