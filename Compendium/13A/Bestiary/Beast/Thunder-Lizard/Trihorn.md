    - name: "Knocked flying"
      desc: "Not only does the _furious charge_ cause damage, but on a _natural even hit_, the target is knocked to one side and dazed until the end of its next turn. On a _natural odd hit_, the target is thrown backward and dazed (save ends). The trihorn ends the round unengaged and ready to make a new _furious charge_ attack."
