      desc: "The target rolls a save. If it fails, the target is helpless (â€“4 to all defences) as it falls unconscious (save ends, or taking 10 damage ends). When a creature falls unconscious this way, each other nearby dainty lizard that is not already engaged will move and attack the target during its next turn."
