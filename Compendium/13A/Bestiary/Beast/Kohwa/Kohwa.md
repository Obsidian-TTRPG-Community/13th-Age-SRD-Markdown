## Abilities for All Kohwa

*Flight:* Kohwa are winged, and therefore capable of flight. While they are strong fliers and able to travel great distances in this way, they are acutely aware of how ungainly they look while doing so, and therefore prefer to walk or run unless they are certain no one is watching.

*Swimming:* Unlike many cat species, kohwa are perfectly at home in the water, so diving into a lake or river is a poor defense against them.

*Telepathy:* Kohwa are capable of short-range telepathy with non-kohwa. It is assumed (although no one is entirely sure) that they are capable of communicating with others of their species at greater distances, as when one is in trouble, others are sure to appearâ€”eventually.
