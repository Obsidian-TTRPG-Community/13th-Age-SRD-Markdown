      desc: "At the start of battle each PC rolls one icon relationship die of their choice and one die chosen from their relationships by the GM.

A roll of a 5 indicates that the chimera gains both a flaw and a benefit associated with that icon. A result of 1 or 2 means that the chimera gains the icon’s chimerical benefit (B) without the flaw. Actual benefits and flaws are up to the GM, and should reflect the icons with which the players have relationships."
