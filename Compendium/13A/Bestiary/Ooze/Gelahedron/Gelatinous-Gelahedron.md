      desc: "Gelatinous creatures have no brains, sometimes they just do things. When the escalation die is odd, instead of making an attack or moving, roll a d6 to see what the cubahedron does. If an option is not viable (you roll a 5 but there is no engulfed enemy), reroll until you get a valid option."
