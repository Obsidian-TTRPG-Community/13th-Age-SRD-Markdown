      desc: "Targets engulfed/grabbed by the cube take 30 acid damage at the start of the cube’s turn but are not viable targets for additional attacks by the cube. Multiple targets can be held within the cube simultaneously.<br/>Any engulfed creature that is also staggered must begin making last gasp saves or become paralyzed as the cube’s toxins overwhelm it."

      desc: "Gelatinous creatures have no brains, sometimes they just do things. When the escalation die is odd, instead of making an attack or moving, roll a d12 to see what the dodecahedron does. If an option is not available (you roll a 1 but there are no nearby enemies), reroll until you get a valid option."
