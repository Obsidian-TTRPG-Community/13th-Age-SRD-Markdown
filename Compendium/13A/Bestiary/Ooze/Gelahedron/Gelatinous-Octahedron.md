traits:

      desc: "Targets engulfed/grabbed by the cube take 38 acid damage at the start of the cube’s turn but are not viable targets for additional attacks by the cube. Multiple targets can be held within the cube simultaneously.<br/>Any engulfed creature that is also staggered must begin making last gasp saves or become paralyzed as the cube’s toxins overwhelm it."
    - name: "Instinctive actions"
      desc: "Gelatinous creatures have no brains, sometimes they just do things. When the escalation die is odd, instead of making an attack or moving, roll a d8 to see what the octahedron does. If an option is not viable (you roll a 3 but there are no nearby targets), reroll until you get a valid option."

      desc: "30 acid damage, and the octahedron is propelled uncontrollably about the area, passing next to each of its enemies. Unlike normal, each enemy can make an opportunity attack against the ooze as it moves this way, but the ooze can make a glomp attack against those who do as a free action as it passes. (Tell the PCs that the ooze will get a counter-attack.)"
