## Environmental Effects

Before the battle, roll a `dice: 1d4` to determine which environmental effect will show up during the fight. Then roll a `dice: 1d3` for the minimum escalation die value that triggers the effect at the start of the round and stays in effect the rest of the battle.

In the unlikely event that PCs have managed to find or lure briar elves outside the briar elf’s forested places of power, these effects probably wouldn’t apply.

## Undead Briar Elves

**1. Whispers of the past**—PCs have a –2 penalty to MD and PD, as overlapping ghostly whispers cause pain and anxiety.

**2. Ghostly terrain**—On rounds when the escalation die is odd the PCs are stuck, unable to move due to ghost trees that suddenly block their paths.

**3. Spectral hands**—PCs take a –1 penalty to attack rolls, as ghostly thorn-pierced hands grab at them.

**4. Fearful destiny**—PCs who could normally resist fear effects cannot do so for the duration of this battle. PCs who cannot normally resist fear take a –2 penalty to their saves whenever they are affected by fear.
