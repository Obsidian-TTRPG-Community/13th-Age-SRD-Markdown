traits:
    - name: "Empowered by death"
      desc: "When the last mook in a mob is slain nearby, or when a creature drops to 0 hit points or dies in some other fashion nearby, the Fallen Icon’s Shadow heals hit point equal to 10 × the creature (or mob’s) level."
    - name: "Open maw"
      desc: "When the escalation die reaches 6, the battle ends as a campaign loss for the player characters. The first consequence of the loss is that the Fallen Icon’s Shadow disappears and the Fallen Icon’s Maw returns to life at some other distant location. Perhaps there is no other terrible consequence. Perhaps that’s enough."

      desc: "While engaged with this creature, if the target has 144 hp or fewer, it’s dazed (–4 attack) and does not add the escalation die to its attacks."
