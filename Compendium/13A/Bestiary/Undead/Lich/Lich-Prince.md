      traits:
          - name: "Natural even hit or miss"
            desc: "Each enemy engaged with the lich prince pops free from it as a bubble of arcane energy pushes them away."
    - name: "C: Soul rend +17 vs. PD (each nearby enemy)"
      desc: "30 negative energy damage, and ghostly hands reach up from the ground and grab the target (as they try to pull the target’s spirit out of its body)"

            desc: "When a creature is being grabbed by the ghostly hands, it takes 30 negative energy damage at the start of its turn and must make a last gasp save.

    - name: "Heartstopper"
      desc: "When the lich prince scores a critical hit, if after taking damage the target still has hit points, it drops to 0 hp, falls unconscious, and begins making death saves. When the target saves against this effect, it regains hit points equal to the amount it had before dropping to 0 hp (after the crit damage). In addition, the crit range of attacks by the lich against the target expands by an amount equal to the escalation die and the lich heals 60 hit points."
    - name: "Immortality"
      desc: "When the lich drops to 0 hit points, it crumbles to dust but does not die. It begins to reform near its phylactery, taking a number of days to regain its full strength equal to its level. If the phylactery has been destroyed, the lich dies when it drops to 0 hit points."
