      desc: "When the screaming hoardling survives a critical hit to AC it makes a _howl of emptiness_ attack as a free action, as a piece of its scavenged armor falls away. Knock a point off its AC."

    - name: "Eternal greed"
      desc: "If the screaming hoardling is reduced to zero HP while coping with the effects of its _howl of emptiness_ attack, at the start of the next turn it rises with 36 HP, then spends a quick action (or two) to re-equip lost items. A character can negate this recovery-from-death by returning a lost item to the corpse with a quick action. If a character has for some reason taken the screaming hoardling’s fallen treasure, they will find themselves pursued by an unkillable enemy until they give that item back."
