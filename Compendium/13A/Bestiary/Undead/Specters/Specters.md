## Nastier Specials for All Specters

*Aura of loss:* The first time during a battle the specter is staggered, each nearby enemy with 30 hp or fewer is hampered until the end of the specter’s next turn. (9<sup>th</sup> level dread specter affects enemies with 60 hp or fewer.)

*Healing drain:* When an enemy engaged with a specter heals, it heals only half the normal hit points, and the specter heals the other half (round down).

*Spectral evasion:* Once per battle as a free action when an enemy attacks the specter, it can force the attacker to reroll the attack and use the result the specter prefers.
