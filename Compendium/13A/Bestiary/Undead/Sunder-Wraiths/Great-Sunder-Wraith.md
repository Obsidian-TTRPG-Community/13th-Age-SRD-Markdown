    - name: "Ghostly"
      desc: "This creature has _resist damage 16+_ to all damage (yes, even holy damage, and for that matter, this creature has outgrown vulnerability to holy damage) except force damage, which damages it normally.<br/>A great sunder wraith can move through solid objects, but it canâ€™t end its movement inside them."
    - name: "Destroyer"
      desc: "Three times per battle when the sunder wraith moves through a solid object like a wall, throne, door, or chest, the object must roll a hard save. If the save fails, the object is broken. Strongly magical objects get bonuses on the save, but err on the side of uh-oh."
