## Abilities for Most Ghosts

Most ghosts have several or all of the following abilities. Normally we use these sections to cover abilities possessed by all the monsters of a certain type, but there’s enough variation in ghost stories that we figure we should provide tools for you to choose from rather than try to force ghosts into one style of haunting.

For the record, all ghosts also have some version of the *ghostly* ability, but its strength varies so we’ve put it into each stat block.

*Bound hauntings:* Most ghosts are bound to an area, usually the area of their death. This ability won’t come up much in play, but it does make it seem likely that ghosts can be easier to get away from than other monsters. Move far enough fast enough and the ghost returns to the area it’s bound to. Occasionally festivals for the dead or other rituals can call bound ghosts from their hauntings, but those are unusual and temporary circumstances.

**Exceptions:** There may be ghosts that are bound to people, or events, or phenomena that travel. There might even be ghosts that aren’t bound to anything, but at that stage there are several other questions that surface and odd magical, iconic, or unique intervention seems likely.

*Flight:* Most ghosts fly, though some may be quite slow, seeming to drift or walking on air. Ghosts that fly in unusual ways will be flagged with their own abilities.

**Exceptions:** Not all ghosts fly. Some seem constrained to act much like they acted when they were alive, and flying wasn’t part of their life package.

*Unnatural touch:* Many ghosts can alter the temperature of their environment to more closely match the underworld or afterlife that they’ve so far evaded. Sometimes that’s icy cold, sometimes that’s burning hot, and sometimes it’s just kind of normal, which would go unnoticed unless the ghost is somewhere abnormal!

**Exceptions:** This is more of a special effect of ghost stories than part of a creature’s combat abilities, and you can safely ignore it unless you find telling moments when it adds to the game.
