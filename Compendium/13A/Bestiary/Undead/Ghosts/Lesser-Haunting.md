      desc: "While there are three or more lesser haunting mooks in a battle, the fear abilities of their allies affect enemies with half again as many hit points as usual. (For example, a 3rd level hungrymouth ghost normally has a fear threshold of 15 hit points. When there are three or more lesser haunting mooks in the battle, the hungrymouth ghost’s fear threshold bumps up to 22 hit points.)"
