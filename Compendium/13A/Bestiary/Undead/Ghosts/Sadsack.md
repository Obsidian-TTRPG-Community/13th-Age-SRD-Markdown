      desc: "This creature has _resist damage 12+_ to all damage except holy damage. A ghost can move through solid objects, but can’t end its turn inside them."

      desc: "Sadsacks are also vulnerable to the type of weapon or attack that ended their lives. Interpret this liberally, GM."

      desc: "Gravity does not influence sadsacks unless they are staggered. When they’re staggered, they sink to the ground and stay there."
