For nastier specials, instead of a slow, poisonous bite, a more deadly bite can also make things challenging for adventurers. Each time a ghoul bites a character, that PC immediately loses a recovery. If they run out of recoveries before their next full heal-up, that character must start making last gasp saves at the start of each battle. If the character fails their fourth last gasp save this way, they turn into a ghoul.
