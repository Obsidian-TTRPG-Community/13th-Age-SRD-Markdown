      desc: "“Yellow hair”, “Afraid of spiders”, “Prefers white wine to red”, or “Tattoo of a halfling on left bicep”. These personal traits are shuffled and randomly distributed equally by the GM after the battle is over. Whichever trait each player receives is now true for their character as well as for the character of the player who wrote it down (unless there has somehow turned out to be a swap…). These traits don’t alter game mechanics (feats, powers, backgrounds, icon relationships, attributes, bonuses, etc.). They are personal details that have been warped and scrambled by the prismatic ogre mage’s magic."
