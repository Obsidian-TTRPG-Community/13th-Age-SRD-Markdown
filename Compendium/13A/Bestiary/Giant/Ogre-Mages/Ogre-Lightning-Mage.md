    - name: "Trollish regeneration 20"
      desc: "While an ogre mage is damaged, its uncanny flesh heals 20 hit points at the start of the ogre mage’s turn. It can regenerate five times per battle. If it heals to its maximum hit points, then that use of regeneration doesn’t count against the five-use limit.<br/>When the ogre mage is hit by an attack that deals fire or acid damage, it loses one use of its regeneration, and it can’t regenerate during its next turn.<br/>Dropping an ogre mage to 0 hp doesn’t kill it if it has any uses of regeneration left."
