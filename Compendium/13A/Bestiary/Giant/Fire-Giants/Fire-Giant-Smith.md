            desc: "20 ongoing fire damage."
          - name: "Crit against a target with metal armor and/or shield"
            desc: "The armor and/or shield is shattered, the target now counts as unarmored with no shield. Magic armors and shields get a save (12 minus the magical AC bonus—so between 11+ for a +1 shield to 7+ for cursed epic +5 armor) to avoid shattering."

      desc: "Enemies who start their turn nearby the fire giant smith take fire damage, unless they resist fire damage. If the enemy is wearing metal armor they take 2d6 fire damage, enemies wielding a metal weapon take 1d6 fire damage, and enemies with an offhand weapon or shield take 1d6 fire damage, and those with coins or clasps of metal take 1d4 fire damage—a maximum of 4d6+1d4 fire damage. Enemies with absolutely no metal items or belongings ignore this ability."
    - name: "Resist fire 16+"
      desc: "When a fire attack targets this creature, the attacker must roll a natural 16+ on the attack roll or it only deals half damage."
    - name: "Fire aura"
      desc: "Enemies engaged with a fire giant smith at the end of their turn take fire damage equal to the escalation die times five (0-5-10-15-25-30) if they have not taken fire damage since the end of their last turn. Enemies who resist fire damage ignore this fire giant’s fire aura."
