    - name: "Acid fangs +8 vs. AC (2 attacks)"
      desc: "8 damage, and 5 ongoing acid damage"
      traits:
          - name: "Natural 5, 10, 15, or 20"
            desc: "The dragon regains the use of its caustic breath if it’s expended and can use it during its next turn."
    - name: "C: Caustic breath +7 vs. PD (1d3 nearby enemies)"
      desc: "10 acid damage, 5 ongoing acid damage, and the target is caught in an acidic haze (see below) with an effect that depends on the roll"
      traits:
          - name: "Natural even hit"
            desc: "While in the haze, the target is dazed from choking or blinding."
          - name: "Natural odd hit"
            desc: "While in the haze, the target takes a –5 penalty to all saves against acid damage."

            desc: "5 ongoing acid damage."
          - name: "Acidic haze: The haze is magical, semi-aware, and remains around the target until the end of the battle or until removed magically. A spellcaster can cast a spell that targets AC or PD to attack the haze and destroy it—the haze has 1 HP and an AC/PD of 22. The GM is encouraged to play fast and loose with physics here"
            desc: "the mist can be burned, condensed/frozen, blown away, absorbed, transmuted, etc. At the GM’s discretion, there may be physical ways to remove the haze, but it should require a hard DC."
          - name: "Limited use"
            desc: "1/battle, as a quick action."
traits:
    - name: "All-terrain terror"
      desc: "A catacomb dragon flies reasonably well, powerful and fast in a straight line though it’s not as maneuverable as more agile flyers. It can also burrow quickly and effectively due to the acidic coating on its skin."
    - name: "Corrosive contact"
      desc: "When an enemy is engaged with the catacomb dragon at the start of its turn, it takes 3 acid damage."
    - name: "Resist acid 14+"
      desc: "When an acid attack targets this creature, the attacker must roll a natural 14+ on the attack roll or it only deals half damage."
