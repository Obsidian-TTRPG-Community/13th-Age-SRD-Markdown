traits:
    - name: "Counter-spell"
      desc: "When an enemy targets the blue dragon with a spell, the dragon can roll a save; success means the spell has no effect on the dragon. If the level of the spell is lower than the dragon’s level, it’s a normal save (11+). Against an equal or higher-level spell, the save is a hard save (16+). If the dragon is staggered, the save target increases by +5 (normal becomes hard, hard becomes 21+; impossible unless the dragon has a save bonus from some other source)."
