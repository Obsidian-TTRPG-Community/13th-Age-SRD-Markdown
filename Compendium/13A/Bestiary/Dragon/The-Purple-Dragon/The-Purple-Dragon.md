## The Purple Dragon, Abilities Common to Each Form and Tier

### Standard Abilities

Rather than repeat these for each entry the following abilities are standard for the Purple Dragon.

*Escalator:* The Purple Dragon adds the escalation die to their attacks.

*Shape-shifter supreme:* The Purple Dragon can choose to be in its human form or its dragon form. Switching forms is a move action. Though their dragon form is huge, their human form is regular size, and other forms are whatever size is appropriate to that form. By epic tier the Purple Dragon can conceivably take any form, but regardless of tier their vanity limits her to forms that feature purple and magenta (purple clothes and magenta hair, purple scales and magenta wing membranes, etc.).

*[Adventurer and champion tier non-ally only] Cunning escapes:* When the Purple Dragon drops to 0 hp or fewer (or would otherwise die) they are not slain, but instead escapes leaving an illusion in their place. When they escape it is a campaign win for the party, as though they had been killed, and their plans crumble. The Purple Dragon cannot return until the next tier (if defeated at adventurer tier they cannot return until champion tier, if defeated at champion tier they return at epic tier).

*[Once per battle, in human form only] “No, they’re the real Purple Dragon, shoot them!”:* As a quick action at the end of one of their turns, the Purple Dragon uses their powers of illusion and mind-control to make one of their attackers (usually the closest one to them) look and sound like them; the next attack against the Purple Dragon has a 50% chance of being targeted against the wrong target. Once the next attack is made, the illusion vanishes.

*Flight:* In their dragon form the Purple Dragon can fly. The Purple Dragon can also fly using magic, but prefers to not do so unless they need to fight a flying enemy.

*Illusionary soiree:* Each round roll a d6 (or a d4 if the fight is at a party or a luxurious lair), if it is equal to or less than the escalation die it has the following effect.

**1: Sparkling lights**—Ranged attacks against the Purple Dragon or their allies have a -2 penalty.

**2-3: Kaleidoscopic kinescope**—Any attacks against the Purple Dragon this round that are natural 1s are rerolled against the nearest ally of the attacker (or against the attacker themselves if there is no other possible target).

**4+: Illusionary terrain**—Any of the Purple Dragon’s enemies that move this round must roll a save, on a failure they end up in a place they did not intend.

### Nastier Specials

“*You’ve got the wrong person”:* The Purple Dragon’s *“No, they’re the real Purple Dragon, shoot them!”* ability lingers long after the battle, maybe for days. This is probably deliberate magic on their part, because when they skip town the party member that looks and sounds like them will take the fall (or at least create enough confusion for them to make good their escape).

*[Epic tier only] Not dead yet:* The Purple Dragon gets one last *cunning escape* at epic tier, and though their plans are ruined by their defeat they’ll return one last time to exact their vengeance upon the party.
