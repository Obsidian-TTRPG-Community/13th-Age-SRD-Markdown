actions:
    - name: "Bladed fan +10 vs. AC"
      desc: "25 damage"
      traits:
          - name: "Natural even hit or miss"
            desc: "Make a second _bladed fan_ attack, and if that is a natural even roll make a third _bladed fan_ attack."
          - name: "Natural odd hit"
            desc: "The target is blown back from the __Purple Dragon__."
          - name: "Natural odd miss"
            desc: "The __Purple Dragon__ pops free and moves away from the target (blown by the wind of the fan)."
    - name: "R: Bedazzling deceptions +9 vs. MD (1d3 nearby enemies)"
      desc: "10 psychic damage and 10 ongoing psychic damage"
      traits:
          - name: "Crit against a target already taking ongoing psychic damage"
            desc: "The target must start making last gasp saves, if they fail they believe that they are the Purple Dragon. Removing this delusion from the target’s mind is as difficult as turning a petrified character back from stone (hard, but not impossible)."
          - name: "Miss"
            desc: "7 psychic damage."
    - name: "“No, they’re the real Purple Dragon, shoot them!”"
      desc: As a quick action at the end of one of their turns, the __Purple Dragon__ uses their powers of illusion and mind-control to make one of their attackers (usually the closest one to them) look and sound like them; the next attack against the __Purple Dragon__ has a 50% chance of being targeted against the wrong target. Once the next attack is made, the illusion vanishes.
      traits:
          - name: Limited Use
            desc: 1/battle
    - name: Shape-shifter supreme
      desc: As a move action, the Purple Dragon can change from their _human form_ to their _[[The Purple Dragon (Adventurer, Dragon Form)|dragon form]]_.
traits:
    - name: Escalator
      desc: The __Purple Dragon__ adds the escalation die to their attacks.
    - name: Shape-shifter supreme
      desc: The __Purple Dragon__ can choose to be in its _human form_ or its _[[The Purple Dragon (Adventurer, Dragon form)|dragon form]]_. Switching forms is a move action. Though their _dragon form_ is huge, their _human form_ is regular size, and other forms are whatever size is appropriate to that form.
    - name: Flight
      desc: In their _dragon form_ the __Purple Dragon__ can fly. They can also fly using magic in their _human form_, but prefers to not do so unless they need to fight a flying enemy.
    - name: Illusionary soirée
      desc: Each round roll a d6 (or a d4 if the fight is at a party or a luxurious lair), if it is equal to or less than the escalation die it has the following effect.
      traits:
          - name: "1: Sparkling lights"
            desc: Ranged attacks against the __Purple Dragon__ or their allies have a -2 penalty.
          - name: "2-3: Kaleidoscopic kinescope"
            desc: Any attacks against the __Purple Dragon__ this round that are natural 1s are rerolled against the nearest ally of the attacker (or against the attacker themselves if there is no other possible target).
          - name: "4+: Illusionary terrain"
            desc: Any of the __Purple Dragon__’s enemies that move this round must roll a save, on a failure they end up in a place they did not intend.
    - name: Cunning escape
      desc: When the __Purple Dragon__ drops to 0 hp or fewer (or would otherwise die) they are not slain, but instead escapes leaving an illusion in their place. When they escape it is a campaign win for the party, as though they had been killed, and their plans crumble. The __Purple Dragon__ cannot return until the next tier (if defeated at adventurer tier they cannot return until champion tier, if defeated at champion tier they return at epic tier).
      traits:
          - name: Limited Use
            desc: Only if the __Purple Dragon__ is engaged in the battle as an antagonist
nastier_traits:
    - name: "“You’ve got the wrong person”"
      desc: "The __Purple Dragon__’s _“No, they’re the real Purple Dragon, shoot them!”_ ability lingers long after the battle, maybe for days. This is probably deliberate magic on their part, because, when they skip town, the party member that looks and sounds like them will take the fall (or at least create enough confusion for them to make good their escape)."
