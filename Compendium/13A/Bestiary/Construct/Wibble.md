    - name: "Disengaged"
      desc: "Wibbles gain a +5 bonus to disengage checks. They also don’t remain engaged with their foes and will move every turn in battle. When they fail a disengage check, a wibble moves away anyway."
    - name: "Eruptive blorp"
      desc: "When an enemy hits a wibble with a melee attack, it takes force damage equal to its level."
    - name: "Flight"
      desc: "Wibbles waft about. They can fly well enough to ignore most wind, but not strong gale winds."
    - name: "Whiff and wibble"
      desc: "When a creature makes a non-spell attack against a wibble and rolls a natural 1–2, 1d3 new wibbles are created in the same area. These new wibbles typically melt back into their “parent” at the end of a battle if not destroyed, but sometimes they remain separate and drift off on their own."
