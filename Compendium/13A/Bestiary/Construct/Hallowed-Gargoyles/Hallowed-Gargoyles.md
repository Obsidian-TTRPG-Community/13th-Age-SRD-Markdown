## Nastier Specials for All Hallowed Gargoyles

These nastier specials also apply to temple lions.

*Mirrored aggression:* Hallowed gargoyles have some ability to sense intentions and a larger capacity to react appropriately! PCs with a negative or conflicted relationship with the Religious Icon are vulnerable to all the hallowed gargoyles’ attacks.

*Statues, statues, everywhere:* Because they look so much like statues, and because most of the things that look like hallowed gargoyles are statues, hallowed gargoyles are capable of springing a surprise on inattentive PCs. When there’s a chance of such an ambush, give the PCs a normal skill check (DC 20 at champion-tier, DC 25 at epic tier) to notice the gargoyles waking and avoid being surprised (13<sup>th</sup> Age core rulebook, page 164).
