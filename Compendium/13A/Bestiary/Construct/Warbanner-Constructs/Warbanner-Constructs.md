Warbanners have a number of abilities in common. The feral warbanner has the full version of these abilities. You may customize the feral warbanner by giving it icon-associated abilities.

A warbanner generally commands large groups of mooks that are simple to play. Creatures in a warbannerâ€™s band are allies fully under its control. It could also have allies not in its band.
