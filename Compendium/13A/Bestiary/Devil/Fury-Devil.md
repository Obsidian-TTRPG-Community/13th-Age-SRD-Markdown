*Hellbent*

Fury devils become hellbent against a creature for story reasons outside the scope of a single battle. PCs could give devils ample reason to hate them. Or a succession of 5s as relationship dice with icon interactions that involve the devils might suffice to make the fury devil hellbent. More often than not, it won’t be one of the PCs who is the target, but getting in the way of hellbent furies is a problem. They will try to bypass defenders, however, to concentrate on killing their target or targets.

Typically, a single fury devil leaves the Pit to exact retribution. If heroes manage to beat that erinyes back, then three new fury devils rise up to try to finish the mission that the first one failed at, and whoever killed the first erinyes is on their hit list, too. If those devils fail, five erinyes come next, with another hero added to their list. If stout-hearted heroes defeat all five fury devils, they’re safe. Maybe.
