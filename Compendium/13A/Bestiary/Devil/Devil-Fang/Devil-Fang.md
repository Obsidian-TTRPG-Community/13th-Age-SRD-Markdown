## Devil, Fang

Fang Devil is a singular river creature. 

- The first time the heroes encounter the devil, it should be a 7<sup>th</sup> level monster. 
	- If the PCs slay the devil near water, you may foreshadow that the devil will be back as a multiplicity of 10<sup>th</sup> level river devils. 
- In 13<sup>th</sup> Age, threats don’t necessarily die the first time you deal with them. In the case of Fang Devil, it’s a localized threat within one river at a time at 7<sup>th</sup> level. 
	- When it becomes a multiplying group of 10<sup>th</sup> level creatures, it could spread out wherever the campaign requires it.
