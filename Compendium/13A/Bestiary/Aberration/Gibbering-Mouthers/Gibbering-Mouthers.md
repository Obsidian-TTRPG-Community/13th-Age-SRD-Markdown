## Abilities for All Gibbering Mouthers

Gibbering mouthers have the following abilities:

*Eyes everywhere:* Gibbering mouthers can’t be ambushed or sneaked up on.

In addition, though gibbering mouthers are aberrations they are ooze-like enough that they use the ooze abilities flows where it likes and ooze.

*Flows where it likes:* The gibbering mouther is immune to opportunity attacks.

*Ooze:* The gibbering mouther is immune to effects. When an attack applies a condition to a gibbering mouther (dazed, hampered, weakened, ongoing damage, etc.), that condition doesn’t affect it.
