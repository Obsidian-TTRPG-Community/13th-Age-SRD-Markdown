## Aberrant Attack Table

Roll a d6 to determine what type of additional attack(s) the hellwarped beast has, and its general characteristics. Use the first set of stats for the brutes, and the second for the spawn.

**1. Biting mandibles +15/+11 vs. AC**—50/13 damage, and the target is stuck (save ends); while the target is stuck this way, at the start of the hellwarped’s turn, it automatically deals 50/13 damage to the target but can’t make an *aberrant attack* that turn.

**2. Extra claw +15/+11 vs. AC**—75/19 damage (and the claw can benefit from the *dual miss* effect).

**3. Lashing tentacle +15/+11 vs. PD**—20/5 damage, and the target is weakened (save ends); the first time the target fails this save, it becomes stunned instead (save ends).

**4. C: Antennae waveburst +15/+11 vs. MD (one nearby enemy)**—20/5 psychic damage, and the target must roll an immediate save. If it fails, it’s confused until the end of its next turn.

**5. R: Shooting quills +15/+11 vs. AC (one nearby enemy not engaged with it)**—40/10 damage. In addition, it takes only half damage from opportunity attacks thanks to the spikes covering it.

**6.** *\[use only when triggered as an aberrant attack\]* **Charging horn slam +15/+11 vs. PD**—50/13 damage, and the target is dazed (save ends).

> *Free charge:* The hellwarped pops free from each enemy engaged with > it after making its *claws* attacks, then moves to a nearby enemy as a > free action and makes this attack.
