      desc: "When an enemy misses the soul flenser with an attack against MD, that attacker takes half the miss damage, if any."
    - name: "Underkraken teleport"
      desc: "A soul flenser that has successfully flensed at least once can (and usually will, provided some of its enemies are confused, weakened, or stunned) use a standard action to prepare itself to teleport. Once it does this, during its next turn it can use a move action to teleport back to its home underkraken, no matter how distant, leaving the battle behind. Soul flensers fighting beside or within their underkraken can’t use this ability; they’re already home."
