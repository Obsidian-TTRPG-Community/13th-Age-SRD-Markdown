      desc: "Any enemy that dies due to ongoing damage from _mutagenic emanations_ instantly rejoins the fight as a star-mask brain zealot allied to the dungeon heart."

      desc: "Until the end of the battle, the next time the target drops to 0 hp or below, the target recovers with temporary hit points equal to its normal maximum hit points, but is now an ally to the dungeon heart. It is a standard action to free an ally next to you from their _sickly sweet feelings_, but doing so makes them lose their temporary hp (at which point they’ll collapse again unless they have been somehow healed above 0 hit points)."
