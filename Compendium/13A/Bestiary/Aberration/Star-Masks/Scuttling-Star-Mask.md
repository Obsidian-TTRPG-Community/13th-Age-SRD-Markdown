Converted player character star-mask cultists can be freed from their masks as a standard action by a character next to them. Use cultist stats and ignore the PC’s hit points and normal attacks and powers; some hand waving may be necessary here, be forgiving if the PCs spend serious resources to deal with the problem during combat."
