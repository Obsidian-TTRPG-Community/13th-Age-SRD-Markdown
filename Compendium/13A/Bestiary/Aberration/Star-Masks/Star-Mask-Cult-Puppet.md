    - name: "Psychic chaff"
      desc: "Star-mask parasites that create puppets quickly die and fade to dust after their puppet drops to 0 hp. After a battle against star-mask puppets, each character must roll a hard save (16+). If they fail, they remember only the host body and not the white mask and black tentacles that were embedded in its flesh. Even characters who succeed find it hard to keep the memory of the star-mask in mind afterward, potentially making for confusing battles against these puppets."
