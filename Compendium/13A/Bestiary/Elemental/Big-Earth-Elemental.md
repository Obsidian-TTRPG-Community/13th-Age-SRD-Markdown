traits:
    - name: "Boulder up"
      desc: "Roll a d8 at the start of each of the earth elemental’s turns. If you roll less than or equal to the escalation die, it shifts into boulder guardian form until the end of the battle. While in this form, it gains a +2 bonus to AC and the relentless pursuit ability (and you stop rolling boulder up checks)."
