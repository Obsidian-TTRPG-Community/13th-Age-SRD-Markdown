## Special Abilities for All Taranar

*All-rock (resist weapons and negative energy 16+):* All taranar are resistant to physical damage as a result of their stony nature. If an assailant fails to make a natural roll of 16+ when using a weapon against a taranar, the attacker deals only half damage. The resistance also applies to negative energy damage, which tends to fizzle ineffectively against the ancient stones.

*Lightning-flare:* As a last ditch defense, when a taranar is reduced to between 1 and 10 hp, it can discharge its remaining stored energy as a counterattack (no attack roll required) against the character who delivered the telling blow, dealing 1d6 lightning damage per level of the taranar. The taranar immediately returns to its immobile rock form and cannot take any further role in the battle. It will then remain torpid unless destroyed or the cycle turns full circle and the conditions for it to wake are met again (providing they can be). Such severely damaged creatures reawaken as broken taranar, regardless of what they were before.

*Thick-skinned:* Being made of stone has its benefits. The taranar are immune to almost all effects—they cannot be dazed, weakened, confused, or made vulnerable to anything beyond those energies they are already vulnerable to (fire and cold; see below). Taranar are also immune to ongoing damage.

## Cracking Up

Taranar are big and tough. But even big, tough creatures have a weakness (or, at least, you really have to hope they do if you don’t want to get squashed). For the stone people, their two main fears are fire and ice. This may stem from their clashes with their ancient foes the frost and fire giants, or it may be due to the actions of those who, over the centuries, have used heat and cold to smash their bodies into manageable fragments.

As a result, the taranar are vulnerable to fire and cold energy, both of which play havoc with their physiology—so much so that a hit from a fire attack followed immediately (either in the current or subsequent round) by a hit from a cold attack will cause double cold damage, irrespective of whether a critical (normally 18+) has been rolled. If a critical is rolled, triple the damage inflicted.

## Iconic Powers

Centuries of existence as free-standing monoliths have exposed the taranar to many of the world’s most powerful magical traditions. There’s something about a circle or avenue of standing stones that inspires druids, cultists, chaos magicians, and wizards to get a ritual going.

Part of the taranar’s remarkable success at hiding through the ages comes from the fact that they don’t wake up just because someone is using their stone as an altar for a goblin sacrifice or a ritual of rebirth. But sleeping through centuries of ritual magic doesn’t mean that the taranar have been unaffected by the experience. It’s possible that a taranar could have acquired lingering magical abilities.

You can use the following special abilities in at least five ways:

1: As a consequence of a story connection between a taranar and its location in the world, obviously exposed for a long period of time to magicians associated with an icon.

2: As a reaction to a PC’s use of an icon advantage, particularly as a possible complication of an icon advantage used when the taranar are in play or in the story.

3: To cast the taranar as heroes or villains relative to the player characters’ intentions.

4: As lower impact nastier specials in battles that seem overly easy on the PCs.

5: In combination with each other, since it’s entirely possible that the magic of more than one icon has shaped a stone!

**Magic Icon (The Flying Stones):** In sympathy with the magic that keeps the Magic Icon city aloft, a taranar influenced by the Magic Icon’s magic can fly until the end of a battle after it has either scored or suffered a critical hit. The flight isn’t quick or agile. More like empowered levitation, about what you’d expect from an airborne monolith.

**Demonic Icon (The Stones are Red):** Roll a random demon ability. The taranar will use that ability once this battle, and once only.

**Graceful Icon (Repose):** Roll a normal save when dropped to 0 hit points. If the save succeeds, the taranar only drops to 1 hit point and teleports somewhere far away to sleep for a while. And then it wakes up. And remembers everything…

**Nature Icon (The Call):** The first time the escalation die reaches 5+, another taranar surfaces in the battle, called up from hidden slumber.
