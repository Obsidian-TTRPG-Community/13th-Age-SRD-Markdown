## Abilities for All Salamanders

*Escalating inferno:* If the salamander is in an area with flames, lava, or that it has set on fire, it gets to use the escalation die, adding it to its attack rolls. Even when not fighting in such an environment, a salamander attacked with a spell or attack that deals fire damage gets to use the escalation die until the end of its next turn, or longer if it’s a powerful or lingering spell. Avoid casting fireball in battle with a salamander!

*Resist fire 16+:* Fire attacks against the salamander must roll a natural 16+ attack roll or the attack does half damage. Whether or not such an attack hits, see escalating inferno!

## Nastier Special

*Heat metal:* Enemies who make a melee attack with a non-magical weapon against a salamander and who roll a natural 1 or 3 take ongoing fire damage equal to twice the salamander’s level unless they drop their weapon as a free action.
