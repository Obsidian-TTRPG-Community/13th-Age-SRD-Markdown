## Abilities for All Xorn

All xorn have the following abilities:

*Rock swimming:* As a move action the xorn can swim through the ground, or through a wall.

*360 degree vision:* The xorn can’t be surprised, and rogues can’t use their Sneak Attack class feature on them.

*Penetrating vision:* The xorn can see through all types of rock and soil for some distance, let’s say “nearby”.

*Resist cold and fire 16+:* Xorn are used to the fires of the deep and the cold of solid rock—when a cold or fire attack targets a xorn, the attacker must roll a natural 16+ on the attack roll or it only deals half damage.
