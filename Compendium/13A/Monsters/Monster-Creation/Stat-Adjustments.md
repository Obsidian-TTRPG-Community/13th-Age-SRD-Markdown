## Stat Adjustments

Ad hoc adjustments work fine when limited to adjustments of 1 or 2 points. If you raise a couple scores, drop a couple others.

- **Scrapper**: Sharp but thin: attacks +1 to +3, hp –10% to –30%

- **Offensive**: Soft but strong: defences –1 to –3, attacks +1 to +3

- **Oaf**: Tough but clumsy: [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Stats/defences/Armor-Class|AC]] +1 to +3, attacks –1 to –3

- **Defensive**: Tough but weak: AC +1 to +3, hp –10% to –30%

- **Lunk**: Big and squishy: hp +15% to +40%, defences –1 to –3

- **Brittle**: Tough but thin: +1 to +3 AC, hp –10% to –30%

If you want to add a full level to a monster…

- **…and you only want to boost its attack**: Give the monster a +6 attack boost.

- **…and you only want to boost AC**: Give the monster a +6 AC boost.

- **…and you only want to increase the monster’s [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Stats/Hit-Points|hit points]]**: Double the monster’s hit points.

- **…and you only want to increase the damage the monster deals**: 	Add a second attack or [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Special-Attacks-and-Effects/Ongoing-Damage|ongoing damage]].

- **…and you only want to increase every stat**: Add +1 to attack, +1 to all defences, multiply its damage output by 1.25, multiply its hit points by 1.25.
