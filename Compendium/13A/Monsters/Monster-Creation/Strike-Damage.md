## Strike Damage

Orient yourself around the average damage for a monster’s attack at any given level. When it comes to large (or double-strength) or huge (or triple-strength) [[Compendium/13A/Monsters/Monsters|monsters]], you don’t have to put all their damage into one strike. Split damage up into smaller attacks or use conditional follow-up attacks.
