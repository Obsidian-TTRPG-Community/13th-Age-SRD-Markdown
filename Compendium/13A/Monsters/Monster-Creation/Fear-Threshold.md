## Fear Threshold

If the monster has a [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Special-Attacks-and-Effects/Conditions/Fear|fear]] ability, it’s the number of [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Stats/Hit-Points|hit points]] where creatures are [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Special-Attacks-and-Effects/Conditions/Dazed|dazed]] (–4 attack) while [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Actions/Movement-and-Melee/Engaged|engaged]] with the monster and can’t use the [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Sequence/Escalation-Die|escalation die]]. It’s based on level, so that higher-level monsters are more fearsome.
