## Underkrakens

While not [[Compendium/13A/Monsters/Monsters|monsters]] in and of themselves, underkrakens are enormous, city-sized dungeons in which monsters (like soul flensers) abide. 

They may be alive, or they may be complex vehicles, or colonies from another dimension or unknown portion of the world.
