## Mooks

Mooks are weaker [[Compendium/13A/Monsters/Monsters|monsters]] that can be cut down in large numbers in a single turn. Damage is not tracked against single mooks, but against the entire mob of mooks you’re facing. 

If you roll damage against a mook and it is greater than the single mook’s [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Stats/Hit-Points|hit points]], then another mook takes the remainder. In this way, damage can cascade to multiple mooks, and a player can kill multiple in one turn, even if they’re not all directly within your attack range.

A mook’s hit point value is one-fifth that of a regular monster.

Mooks move and attack individually. 

Mooks deal a fixed damage when they hit, and double damage when they roll a natural 20.

Mooks can be split up into multiple mobs with different [[Compendium/13A/Monsters/Monster-Creation/Initiative|initiative]] numbers and hit point pools for each.
