## Large and Huge Monsters

Large [[Compendium/13A/Monsters/Monsters|monsters]] generally have twice the hit points and deal roughly double the damage of a normal-sized monster. They also count as **two monsters** when you build a battle.

Huge monsters have triple the [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Stats/Hit-Points|hit points]], deal triple damage, and count as **three normal-sized monsters** when youâ€™re putting together a battle.

Regular-sized monsters may also have the same stats as large and huge monsters, in which case they are labeled as double-strength and triple-strength monsters, respectively.
