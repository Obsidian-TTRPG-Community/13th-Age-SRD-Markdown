## Dire Animals

Dire animals are bigger (large-sized) versions of normal animals. Dire animals usually have at least one dire feature, determined randomly using the table below.

### Dire Feature Table

| `dice: d6` | **Dire Feature**  | **Description**                                                                                                                               |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1        | Armor plates      | Add +2 to the dire animal’s [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Stats/defences/Armor-Class\|AC]], and add +1 to its [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Stats/defences/Physical-Defense\|PD]].                                                                                         |
| 2        | Spiky bits        | Whenever an enemy hits the dire animal with a melee attack, deal damage equal to twice the animal’s level to that attacker.                   |
| 3        | Carnage           | The dire animal’s attacks that miss deal damage equal to its level. When [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Damage-and-Healing/Staggered\|staggered]], its missed attacks deal damage equal to double its level. |
| 4        | Poison            | The dire animal’s main attack also deals 5 ongoing poison damage per tier (5 ongoing poison at levels 1–4, 10 at 5–7, etc.).                  |
| 5        | Dire regeneration | When the [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Sequence/Escalation-Die\|escalation die]] is even, this animal heals damage equal to triple its level at the start of its turn.                                 |
| 6        | Fury              | While staggered, the dire animal gains a +2 attack bonus and deals +4 damage, but at the end of each of its turns it takes 2d6 damage.        |
