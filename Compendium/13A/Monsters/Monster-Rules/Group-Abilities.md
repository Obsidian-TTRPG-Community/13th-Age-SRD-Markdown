## Group Abilities

A few monsters have limited [abilities](Compendium/13A/Character-Rules/Abilities.md) that can be used a certain number of times in a battle for the group. Any monster within that group may use the ability, but then the number of available uses is decremented for the entire group. It does not matter which monster uses the ability.

[Mooks](Mooks.md) cannot have group abilities.
