## Monster Abilities

[Monsters](../Monsters.md) may have special [abilities](Compendium/13A/Character-Rules/Abilities.md) for use in battle.

### Burrowing

Burrowing is a special rule for monsters that allows somewhat restricted movement underground. Unless otherwise specified, monsters generally do not leave functional tunnels behind them when burrowing.

A burrowing creature on the surface may attempt to burrow underground by using a [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Sequence/Actions-on-Your-Turn/Standard-Move-and-Quick-Actions/Standard-Move-and-Quick-Actions|standard]] action. Burrowing is successful if a saving throw beats the required save for the type of ground.

| **Type of Ground**            | **Difficulty** | **Save Needed** |
|-------------------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Sand, dirt, forest soil       | Easy           | 6+              |
| Hard-packed dirt, loose rocks | Normal Save    | 11+             |
| Rock, caves, dungeon floors   | Hard Save      | 16+             |        
^13A-Monster-Burrow

After successfully burrowing, a creature may move underground, faster or slower depending on the hardness of the ground, out of sight of other creatures, hidden and safe from attacks.

For breaking through to the surface, the sequence is as follows: a move action from deeper under the ground to come close to the surface, close enough that people see there’s something coming, followed by a quick action to break through, and then by a standard action attack.

### Death Attacks and Last Gasp Saves

Some deadly monsters have a special attack called a death attack that can kill (petrify, paralyze, liquefy, immolate) in a single attack. Such attacks offer the player a last-gasp save.

A player that is affected by a death attack has a limited amount of last-gasp [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Special-Attacks-and-Effects/Saves|saves]] to try to throw off the condition of the death attack.

On the first turn a player is affected, the player may make a single action (standard, move, or quick), after which they must roll a hard save (16+).

- If successful, the player shrugs off the death attack condition and can act normally on their next turn.
- If unsuccessful, their turn ends and the player may not take any other actions on future turns except for further last-gasp saves.

Each successive last-gasp save is a hard save (16+).

A successful save means that the player can act normally on the next round, unless the player rolls a natural 20 for their last-gasp save, which means that the player can take their turn normally in the current round.

Once a player fails four last-gasp saves while fighting off the death attack, the death attack effect succeeds, and the player is adversely affected as the attack indicates.

An ally may assist a player affected by a death attack. The ally must use a **standard action** to help the player shake off the attack.

- This gives the player a free last-gasp save that may be rolled immediately. (A failure doesn’t count against the four allowed saves.)
- In addition, the assisted save becomes normal difficulty (11+) instead of hard.

#### Fear

Some monsters may have an aura of fear that makes them more difficult to be attacked.

A character engaged with such a monster must have a certain amount of hit points (according to the level of the monster with the fear aura) or be dazed (-4 attack) and gain no benefit

| **Level** | **Fear threshold (HP)** |
|-------|---------------------|
| 0     | 7                   |
| 1     | 9                   |
| 2     | 12                  |
| 3     | 15                  |
| 4     | 18                  |
| 5     | 24                  |
| 6     | 30                  |
| 7     | 36                  |
| 8     | 48                  |
| 9     | 60                  |
| 10    | 72                  |
| 11    | 96                  |
| 12    | 120                 |
| 13    | 144                 |
| 14    | 192                 |        
^13A-Monster-Fear-Aura

Should the character’s hp increase past the fear threshold or the character disengage from the monster, they lose the dazed effect and regain the escalation die benefits.
