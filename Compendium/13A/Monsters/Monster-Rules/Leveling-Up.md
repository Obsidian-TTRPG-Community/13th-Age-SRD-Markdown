## Levelling up

Use these guidelines to raise an existing monster by one or more levels.

1. Raise its [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Stats/Attack-Bonuses|attack bonuses]] and defences by 1 per added level.
2. For damage, hp, and related special [abilities](Compendium/13A/Character-Rules/Abilities.md) (like healing), multiply the monster’s stats accordingly:

| **Levels Added** | **Damage Multiplier** |
|------------------|-----------------------|
| +1 level         | x 1.25                |
| +2 levels        | x 1.6                 |
| +3 levels        | x 2.0                 |
| +4 levels        | x 2.5                 |
| +5 levels        | x 3.2                 |
| +6 levels        | x 4.0                 |
