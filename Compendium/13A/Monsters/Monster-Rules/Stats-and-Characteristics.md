Most monster attacks generally deal a specific amount of damage (instead of rolling for damage) and don’t add on the escalation die. Only exceptional [monsters](../Monsters.md) get to add the [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Sequence/Escalation-Die|escalation die]] to their attacks.

Monsters may have particular [abilities](Compendium/13A/Character-Rules/Abilities.md) or powers that are triggered when the attack roll is greater than a certain threshold. The default trigger happens at a 16+ monster d20 attack roll, though unpredictable monsters may have effects trigger on other rolls.
