its next turn as it sees a foe from its past.</p>
<p><em>Natural odd hit:</em> The target is weakened until the end of its
next turn as it remembers a past failure.</p>
<p><em>Rewards of the patron:</em> So long as the attack hits one or
more targets, one ally of the prophet’s choice gains a cumulative +1
attack bonus until the end of the battle that increases that ally’s
natural attack roll (so a roll of natural 15 becomes a roll of natural
16 with a +1 bonus, or a natural 17 with a +2 bonus, etc.). The ally can
choose not to use the bonus.</p>
<p><em>Saw it coming:</em> Twice per battle as a free action, the
prophet can try to avoid a non-critical attack that hits it. The
attacker must reroll the attack roll with a –4 penalty.</p>
<p><em>Knows the angles:</em> Twice per battle as a move action, the
prophet can teleport to anywhere it can see, or to a location it can’t
see but that has the correct geometry and that it has previously
prepared (a lair).</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p><em>Haruspicy master:</em> When an enemy has dropped to 0 hp or lower
since the prophet’s last turn, as a quick action it can get a glimpse of
the near-future. It grants 1d3 nearby allies a +4 bonus to attacks and
to all defences until the start of its next turn.</p>
<p><em>A special secret:</em> When the prophet makes a <em>whispered
secrets</em> attack, it can choose to target only one nearby enemy. If
it does, it gains a +4 attack bonus against that enemy and the hit
effects are save ends.</p></td>

## Explanation

### Size and Strength and Level

These are the key stats that determine how tough a battle will be using the creature.  

Sizes are regular, large, and huge. 

Regular-sized monster can have double-strength (2x) and triple-strength (3x). 

Regular-sized and regular-strength monsters are labeled as normal.

### Role

Monsters with different roles still use the same stats.

#### Archers

Archers are ranged attackers who use weapons rather than spells.

#### Blockers

Blockers have [abilities](Compendium/13A/Character-Rules/Abilities.md) that help them protect their allies.

#### Casters

Casters are magician-types who need space to cast their spells properly. They’re capable of anything.

#### Leaders

Leaders have abilities that help other monster allies fight better.

#### Mooks

[Mooks](../Monster-Rules/Mooks.md) are minor monsters that are good cannon fodder. (See Mooks.)

#### Spoilers

Spoilers mess the PCs up with attacks that inflict harmful effects instead of or in addition to hit point damage.

#### Troops

Troops are the default monster type that aim to hurt PCs via hit point damage.

#### Wreckers

Wreckers really bring the pain. Enemy groups containing only wreckers will be very dangerous to the PCs.

## Type

Some spells and [magic items](Compendium/13A/Magic-Items/Magic-Items.md) care about monster type. A ranger with a favored enemy type definitely cares about it.

Types include aberration, beast, construct, demon, dragon, giant, humanoid, ooze, and undead.

## Initiative, AC, PD, MD, HP

See [Combat Stats](Compendium/13A/Character-Rules/Combat-Stats.md).

## Attack

The default attack is a melee attack against one target that requires a [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Sequence/Actions-on-Your-Turn/Standard-Move-and-Quick-Actions/Standard-Move-and-Quick-Actions|standard]] action to use. If an attack can target more than one creature, that information follows the attack value.

When a monster makes an opportunity attack, it must use a melee attack. If that attack action normally includes multiple attacks, it can make only one attack roll.

**The abbreviation R**: indicates that an attack is a ranged attack instead of a melee attack. The default ranged attack assumes a single nearby target, but some can hit far away targets as well, which is noted in the targeting information or extra effect trigger.

**The abbreviation C**: refers to close-quarters attacks that can be used without triggering opportunity attacks from engaged enemies like ranged attacks do. Each close-quarters attack will note its targets.

Some attacks can only be used when the natural roll triggers it. These attacks have a [Special trigger] indicator at the start of the attack line. Other triggers allow a monster to use a normal standard action attack as a free action.

## Extra Effect Trigger

Many [monster abilities](../Monster-Rules/Monster-Abilities.md) trigger randomly based on the monster’s attack roll. Not all attacks have triggers. Most extra effect triggers are natural even or odd attack rolls or other specific die rolls, but a few are more unusual.

## Specials

These are other attacks and special abilities like [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Special-Attacks-and-Effects/Conditions/Fear|fear]] or movement abilities like flight. Not all monsters have them.

Some monsters have nastier special abilities that increase a monster’s options and help keep monsters interesting throughout the campaign. Use them as options whenever you like.
