## Dragonic - Dragonspawn

### Racial Bonus

+2 Str or +2 Cha

### Racial Power

#### Breath Weapon

Once per battle, make a close-quarters breath weapon attack as a quick action using your highest ability score against one [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Actions/Position/Nearby|nearby]] enemy’s [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Stats/defences/Physical-Defense|Physical Defense]].

On a hit, the attack deals `dice: 1d6` damage per your level of an energy type that makes sense for your character.

#### Dragonic/Dragonspawn Champion Feat

Your breath weapon attack targets `dice: 1d3` [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Actions/Position/Nearby|nearby]] enemies in a group instead.
