## Gnome

### Racial Bonus

+2 Dex or +2 Int

#### Small

Gnomes have a +2 AC bonus against opportunity attacks.

### Racial Power

#### Confounding (Racial Power)

Once per battle, when you roll a natural 16+ with an attack, you can also daze the target until the end of your next turn.

#### Gnome Champion Feat

Instead of being dazed, the target of your confounding ability is weakened until the end of your next turn.

#### Minor Illusions

As a standard action, at-will, you can create a strong smell or a sound nearby. Nearby creatures that fail a normal save notice the smell or sound. Creatures that make the save may notice it but recognise it as not exactly real.
