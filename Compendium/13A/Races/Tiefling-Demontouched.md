## Tiefling - Demontouched

### Racial Bonus

+2 Str or +2 Int

### Racial Power

#### Curse Of Chaos

Once per battle as a free action when a [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Actions/Position/Nearby|nearby]] enemy rolls a natural 1â€“5 on an attack or a save, turn their roll into a natural 1 and improvise a further curse that shows how their attempt backfires horribly.

A curse should have about the same impact as a typical once-per-battle ability. For example, a typical curse might lead to the cursed attacker dealing half damage to themself with their fumbled attack and being [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Special-Attacks-and-Effects/Conditions/Dazed|dazed]] until the end of their next turn.

The GM may reward storytelling flair and/or limit the suggested effects of the curse.

#### Tiefling - Demontouched Champion FeaT

Whenever a nearby enemy rolls a natural 1 on an attack against you, you can use curse of chaos against them without expending it.
