#### Never Say Die

Whenever you drop to 0 hp or below, roll a normal save if you have a recovery available.

On an 11+, instead of falling unconscious, you stay on your feet and can heal using a recovery. Add the recovery [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Stats/Hit-Points|hit points]] to 0 hp to determine your hp total.

#### Forgeborn - Dwarf-forged Champion Feat

If you roll a 16+ on your *never-say-die* save, you gain an additional [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Sequence/Actions-on-Your-Turn/Standard-Move-and-Quick-Actions/Standard-Move-and-Quick-Actions|standard]] action during your next turn.
