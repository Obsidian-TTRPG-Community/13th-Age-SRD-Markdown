## Dark Elf

### Racial Bonus

+2 Dex or +2 Cha

### Adventurer Feat (Elf)

#### Heritage of the Sword

If you can already use swords that deal d6 and d8 damage without attack penalties, you gain a +2 damage bonus with them. 

>[!tip] This bonus doesn’t increase miss damage. 

Otherwise, if your [[Compendium/13A/Character-Rules/Class|class]] would ordinarily have an attack penalty with such swords, you can now use them without penalties.

### Racial Power

#### Cruel

Once per battle, deal [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Special-Attacks-and-Effects/Ongoing-Damage|ongoing damage]] to a target you hit with a natural even attack roll as a free action. The ongoing damage equals 5 times your level. (For example, at 3rd level you would deal 15 ongoing damage against a single target.) As usual, a normal save (11+) ends the damage. A critical hit doesn’t double this [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Special-Attacks-and-Effects/Ongoing-Damage|ongoing damage]].

#### Dark Elf Champion Feat

Once per day, you can instead use cruel to deal 5 ongoing damage per level against an enemy you miss or that you roll a natural odd attack against.
