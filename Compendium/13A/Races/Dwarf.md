## Dwarf

### Racial Bonus

+2 Con or +2 Wis

### Racial Power

#### That’s Your Best Shot?

Once per battle as a free action after you have been hit by an enemy attack, you can heal using a recovery. If the [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Sequence/Escalation-Die|escalation die]] is less than 2, you only get half the usual healing from the recovery. Unlike other [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Damage-and-Healing/Recoveries|recoveries]] that might allow you to take an average result, you have to roll this one!

Note that you can’t use this ability if the attack drops you to 0 hp or below. You’ve got to be on your feet to sneer at their attack and recover.

#### Dwarf Champion Feat

If the [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Sequence/Escalation-Die|escalation die]] is 2+ when you use that’s your best shot, the recovery is free.
