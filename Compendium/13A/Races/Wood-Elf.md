## Wood Elf

### Racial Bonus

+2 Dex or +2 Wis

### Racial Power

#### Elven Grace

- At the start of each of your turns, roll a die to see if you get an extra [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Sequence/Actions-on-Your-Turn/Standard-Move-and-Quick-Actions/Standard-Move-and-Quick-Actions|standard]] action.
- If your roll is equal to or lower than the [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Sequence/Escalation-Die|escalation die]], you get an extra standard action that turn.

At the start of battle, you roll a d6.

Each time you successfully gain an extra action, the size of the die you roll increases by one step on the following progression:

| Die  | Dice Rolls |
| ---- | ------------- |
| d4 | `dice: 1d4`   |
| d6   | `dice: 1d6`   |
| d8   | `dice: 1d8`   |
| d10  | `dice: 1d10`  |
| d12  | `dice: 1d12`  |
| d20  | `dice: 1d20`              |

If you get an extra action after rolling a d20, you canâ€™t get any more extra actions that battle.

#### Wood Elf Champion Feat

Once per day, start a battle rolling a d4 for elven grace instead of a d6.
