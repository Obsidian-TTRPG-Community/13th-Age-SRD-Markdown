## Never Say Die

**Requirements**:: **[Forgeborn](Compendium/13A/Races/Forgeborn-Dwarf-forged.md)** or **[Dwarf-forged](Compendium/13A/Races/Forgeborn-Dwarf-forged.md)**

Whenever you drop to 0 hp or below, roll a normal save if you have a recovery available. 

On an 11+, instead of falling unconscious, you stay on your feet and can heal using a recovery. Add the recovery hit points to 0 hp to determine your hp total.
