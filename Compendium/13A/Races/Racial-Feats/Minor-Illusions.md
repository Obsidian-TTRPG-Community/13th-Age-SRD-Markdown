## Minor Illusions

**Requirements**:: **[Gnome](Compendium/13A/Races/Gnome.md)**

As a standard action, at-will, you can create a strong smell or a sound nearby. Nearby creatures that fail a normal save notice the smell or sound. Creatures that make the save may notice it but recognize it as not exactly real.
