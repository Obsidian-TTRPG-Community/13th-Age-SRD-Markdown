## Elven Grace

**Requirements**:: **[Wood Elf](Compendium/13A/Races/Wood-Elf.md)**

- At the start of each of your turns, roll a die to see if you get an extra standard action. 
- If your roll is equal to or lower than the escalation die, you get an extra standard action that turn.

At the start of battle, you roll a d6. 

Each time you successfully gain an extra action, the size of the die you roll increases by one step on the following progression: 

| Die  | Dice Rolls |
| ---- | ------------- |
| d4 | `dice: 1d4`   |
| d6   | `dice: 1d6`   |
| d8   | `dice: 1d8`   |
| d10  | `dice: 1d10`  |
| d12  | `dice: 1d12`  |
| d20  | `dice: 1d20`              |

If you get an extra action after rolling a d20, you canâ€™t get any more extra actions that battle.
