## Artifacts

Artifacts are a special type of unique magic item that have their own story. They’re capable of providing multiple powers and benefits to their bearer, although that power comes at a cost.

Each artifact functions like a normal true magic item of its type, possessing the same default bonus, if any, and occupying one of its bearer’s chakras, if that’s how that type functions.

Unlike other true magic items, artifacts have more than one power, each with its associated quirk. When you first attune an artifact, choose one of its powers from your tier or lower. Each time you gain a level after that, you can choose to learn another of the artifact’s powers from your tier or lower.

The artifact’s default bonus depends on the highest tier power you have chosen from the artifact. - If you have an artifact magic weapon but have only attuned one of its adventurer-tier powers, it functions as an adventurer-tier weapon, granting only a +1 bonus to attack and damage. - Attune one of its champion-tier powers and the weapon will blossom into its champion-tier potential, granting a +2 bonus to attack and damage.

On the other hand, you don’t have to attune all of an artifact’s powers and you don’t have to take them in order.

Only one artifact may be carried at a time. In addition, each power you choose from an artifact counts as an additional magic item for the number of true magic items you are allowed to use before your item’s quirks overpower you.

Since acquiring an artifact is a major campaign event and such a big deal, even the icons will take notice. Each artifact should have a section on icon relationships that the artifact more or less requires. If you attune an artifact and don’t have the required relationships, you will soon, as fate and destiny reshape around you! Otherwise the artifact will eventually disappear on you, finding a bearer more to its taste.
