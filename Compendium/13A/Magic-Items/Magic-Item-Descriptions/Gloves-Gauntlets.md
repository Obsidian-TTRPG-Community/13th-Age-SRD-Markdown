## Gloves, Gauntlets

### Default Bonus

None.

#### Adventurer

##### Ambidexterity

(Recharge 11+)

When you roll a natural 16+ with your first melee attack during your turn while wielding a weapon in your off-hand, make a melee attack with the weapon in your off-hand as a free action, using +10 as your attack bonus (champion: +15; epic: +20).  
**Quirk**: Writes with both hands at the same time on different parts of the page. It freaks people out.

##### Arcane Contact

These gloves improve your ability to contact, detect, and distinguish supernatural forces, provided you can touch some material object connected to a force. If, for example, you are improvising a ritual to gain a vision related to the scary artifact you just found, touching the artifact will help. The benefit is modest, determined by the GM, and possibly secret. The gloves provide no protection against the supernatural forces that touching an artifact might usher into your soul.  
**Quirk**: Always cracks knuckles.

##### Archer’s Gauntlets

(Recharge 16+)

When you miss with a ranged weapon attack, reroll it using +10 as your attack bonus (champion: +15; epic: +20).  
**Quirk**: You’re quiet. Too quiet. Say something.

##### Gauntlets of Clobbering

(Recharge 16+)

You deal +`dice: 1d8` damage with two-handed weapons until the end of the battle (champion: +`dice: 2d8`; epic: +`dice: 4d10`).  
**Quirk**: Clobber first, talk later.

##### Gloves of Mind Rot

(Recharge 6+)

When you hit one or more foes with an arcane spell attack, deal +`dice: 1d10` psychic damage to one target of the attack (champion: +`dice: 2d10`; epic: +`dice: 5d10`).  
**Quirk**: The texture of your skin seems wrong to everyone else, but you know it’s all in their minds and often explain that to them.

##### Jeweled Glove

(Recharge 6+)

When you cast a divine spell, allow one nearby ally to roll a save against one ongoing save ends effect as a free action.  
**Quirk**: Alternately paranoid that people are looking too closely at your precious jeweled glove and upset that people aren’t paying enough attention to your amazing jeweled glove.

##### Musical Touch

While you wear these fine silk gloves, you can play any musical instrument without instruction. The gloves, however, don’t make you any more of a musician than you already are.  
**Quirk**: Hums and picks up tunes easily.

##### Sure Fingers

You gain a +2 bonus to any skill check that involves sleight of hand, strength of grip, hand-eye coordination, or similar abilities.  
**Quirk**: Holds a pinky finger up when holding a cup.
