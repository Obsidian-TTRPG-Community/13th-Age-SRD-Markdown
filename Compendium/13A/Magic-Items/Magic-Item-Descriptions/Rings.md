## Rings

### Default Bonus

None.

#### Adventurer

##### Cheap Shot

(Quick action – recharge 11+)

One enemy you’re engaged with takes damage equal to your normal melee miss damage.  
**Quirk**: Often stops speaking mid-sentence.

##### Defense

(Recharge 6+)

When you take damage from an attack, prevent 10 of that damage (champion: prevent 20; epic: prevent 40).  
**Quirk**: Stubborn.

##### Glory

This brilliant, gem-encrusted ring gives you an aura of status (and whatever that entails). Everyone can see it, even if they don’t know why.  
**Quirk**: Becomes more and more obsessed with the idea that all their accomplishments are undeserved and that they themselves are frauds. This obsession often drives them to heroic acts.

##### Instant Vengeance

(Recharge 16+)

When you take damage from an enemy’s attack, choose one ally you can see. That ally can make a basic attack (melee or ranged) against the attacker as a free action.  
**Quirk**: Sticks close to their friends, real close.

##### Iron Grip

When you make a skill check involving climbing, holding something, or otherwise using your hands to grip things, you can use +10 as your bonus in place of your normal bonus (level + ability mod + background; other magic item bonuses still count) (champion: +15; epic: +20).  
**Quirk**: Loves to arm wrestle, thumb wrestle, drum fingers on tables, etc.

##### Jack of All Trades

When you make a skill check, if your background bonus for that check is +1 or +0, you gain a +2 bonus for your background bonus instead (if your bonus is +2 or higher, this ring has no effect).  
**Quirk**: Talks as though they know everything.

##### Relentless Strike

(Standard action – recharge 16+)

Make a basic attack ignoring any effects that give you an attack penalty, prevent you from attacking, keep you from taking actions, or force you to reroll the attack. You can also use this ring’s power while you’re stunned, even though you couldn’t normally take an action.  
**Quirk**: Has near-constant insomnia.

##### Resilience

(Recharge 6+)

When you use this ring, heal using a recovery.  
**Quirk**: Eats an odd vegetarian diet and advocates it loudly.

##### Skin of Your Teeth

(Recharge 6+)

When an enemy attacks you, subtract 1 from the natural attack roll after seeing it.  
**Quirk**: Regularly finds copper pieces and other minor valuables on the ground.

##### Thief’s-Eye

While the ring is on your finger, if you shut both eyes and concentrate, you can see through the ring, allowing you to peer around corners and such.  
**Quirk**: You’re always prying into things that should maybe be left shut; doors, topics of conversation, taboos….

##### Wild Heart

Animals accept you and may even show you affection. The animals, however, still react normally if you threaten them, and well-trained guard animals are especially wary of you.  
**Quirk**: Seems out of place in civilization.
