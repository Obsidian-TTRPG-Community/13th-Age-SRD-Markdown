## Belt, Swordbelt, Kilt, Skirt, Girdle, Sash

### Default Bonus

Increase your maximum recoveries: by 1 (adventurer); by 2 (champion); by 3 (epic).

### Optional Default Bonus

Don’t increase your recoveries depending on the tier. Instead, the item gives you one extra recovery. But when you heal using that recovery, you don’t roll and the hit points you heal depend on the tier of the item: 20 hp (adventurer); 50 hp (champion); 125 hp (epic).

### Adventurer

#### Blademasters Belt

One magical sword sheathed on this belt gains a +2 bonus to recharge rolls for its own powers.  
**Quirk**: Worries too much about tiny details.

#### Brutal Vigor

(Recharge 6+)

When you rally, make a basic attack.  
**Quirk**: Plays with their weapons.

#### Glorious Rally

When you rally, you gain 4 temporary hit points that last until the end of your next turn (champion: 10 temp hp; epic: 25 temp hp).

#### Heroic Resolve

(Recharge 11+)

You can use a recovery to prevent all damage from an attack (including ongoing damage), but not effects.  
**Quirk**: Has terrible heartburn.

#### Last Word

When you heal using your last remaining recovery, you heal 30 additional hit points (champion 75 hp; epic: 200 hp).  
**Quirk**: Stubbornly independent.

#### Potion Belt

(Recharge 16+)

Drink a potion stored on this belt as a quick action instead of a standard action. (It also provides slots for up to six potions.)  
**Quirk**: Constantly attempts to refill everyone else’s drinks. Or potions. Or ration bags.

#### Resilience

(Recharge 16+)

When you rally, you can use a second recovery to heal after using the first (and seeing the recovery roll).  
**Quirk**: Grinningly optimistic.

#### Victory by Inches

You must carry a single magic melee weapon that you keep attached to this item for it to manifest its power. When using that weapon, apply the weapon’s magic bonus to miss damage.  
**Quirk**: Have a hard time taking no for an answer.

### Champion

#### Resurgence

(Recharge 16+)

When you drop to 0 hit points or lower, heal using a recovery before falling unconscious.  
**Quirk**: Bursts forth with wildly optimistic comments from time to time.

#### Sash of Suppleness

(Recharge 6+)

A silky sash worn as a belt. When an attack hits your AC and deals 16 damage or less, change that hit into a miss (epic: 40 damage or less).  
**Quirk**: Always stretching, even when it would be more polite or sensible to not be doing so.

### Epic

#### Kilt of the Mad Archmage

(Recharge 11+)

When you drop one or more foes with an arcane spell attack, heal using a recovery and gain a +4 bonus to attack rolls with spells until the end of your next turn.  
**Quirk**: Roll eyes and giggle too often for comfort.

#### Totem Kilt

A hide-and-fur skirt bedecked with garish tribal charms, totemic symbols, and spirit knots. You can reroll the first death save you make each battle. Add +2 to the roll. **Quirk**: Sometimes speaks with the voices of ancestors.

#### Vitality

Whenever you take ongoing damage, roll an immediate save to end the effect without taking damage first.  
**Quirk**: Fascinated by patterns.
