## Wondrous Items

You can attune multiple wondrous items. They don’t fill up a chakra.

### Default Bonus

None.

#### Lore Bottle

A bottle of translucent glass, sealed with lead, with a ghastly face that peers out at you. When you ask it questions, it answers in the form of vague hunches. For tough questions, the face might fade out for a while, apparently searching somewhere for an answer. Owning the bottle gives you +2 bonus to Intelligence-based skill checks, if you have the time (and privacy) to consult the lore bottle. Chances are, your particular lore bottle has some sort of specialty or bias, which you will discover only through use. Unlike most magic items, lore bottles can often be found for sale, but you probably don’t want those.  
**Quirk**: The connection formed with the face in the bottle can be compelling and unsettling, as the spirit literally “gets in your head.” Each bottle has a different effect on its owner.

#### Dwarven Mug

One in four mugs of ale you drink from this mug will be magically transformed into the very finest non-magical dwarven ale. If your relationship with the mug is good, the variety might even suit your current mood and the odds of getting a good brew might improve in your favor. But really, who’s going to complain about putting down a second, or even third, mug for the chance to get a taste of the best stuff? When that excellent ale does show up, you can share a sip or two with a friend, but other attempts to capitalize on this mug’s magic will just shut it down until it can find a more suitable owner.  
**Quirk**: Speaks in dwarven, especially while drunk, even if ordinarily unable to speak dwarven.

#### Rope of Entangling

Fifty feet of fine, spidersilk rope, woven so closely that it seems like a solid, flexible cable. Once you attune the rope during a full heal-up, you can make it entangle things with standard action commands. In combat, it’s not that useful, because it’s slow compared to a living thing. If the target is stationary, however, the rope excels at reaching, climbing, snaking, coiling, and entangling. You might be able to get the rope to bind a ferocious monster, but the rope is likely to get destroyed in the process.  
**Quirk**: Speaks in sentences for which “convoluted” is the only proper term.

### Chuul Symbiote Magic Items

**Quirks:** Chuul-derived items are symbiotic, weaving their flesh with the flesh of their wielder. Instead of affecting the personality of the wielder, their quirk is that they warp the wielder’s body in minor yet often disturbing ways. Over-attuning causes obviously monstrous mutations that are hard to hide.

**Chuulish Recharge:** Chuulish items draw life energy and vital essences directly from their hosts. Any chuul-derived item that has a recharge has the following chuulish recharge rule.

The item has a recharge roll like normal magic items, but it’s easier to recharge it if the user is willing to use their own life force to help. These items recharge normally on 16+, or on 11+ for a cumulative –1 penalty to all saves until the next full heal-up, or on 6+ for a cumulative –2 penalty to all saves until the next full heal-up, or recharge without a roll for a cumulative –3 penalty to all saves until the next full heal-up.

#### Chitin Claw

(ring)

This fleshy multi-eyed loop sheaths a finger in sharp carapace.  
*Always*: When you pick a lock, disarm a trap, or otherwise perform a task that having a tiny shape-changing blade and tiny eyes attached to your finger would be aided by, you gain a +2 bonus to the roll.  
**Quirk**: Gnarled over-long fingers on that hand.

#### Chuul Helm

(helm)

This insectile segmented helm is lined with ganglia that link with your brain.  
*Always*: +1 MD (adventurer); +2 MD (champion); +MD (epic).  
**Chuulish recharge**: You gain resist psychic 12+ until the end of the battle (champion: resist psychic 16+; epic: resist psychic 18+).  
**Quirk**: Bone-ridged holes in skull.

Chuulish Cuirass

(heavy armor)

The many eyes and symbiotic nervous system in this torso armor give you warning of danger.  
*Always*: +1 AC (adventurer); +2 AC (champion); +3 AC (epic).  
**Chuulish recharge**: You gain a +4 bonus to all defences against ranged attacks until the end of the battle.  
**Quirk**: Over-large protruding ribs.

#### Clawed Tentacles

(gloves)

These claw-covered tentacles normally reside under the skin of the forearm, completely concealed.  
**Chuulish recharge**: Choose an enemy engaged with you. Until the end of the battle, whenever that enemy tries to disengage from you or pop free from you, it must first succeed at an easy save (champion: normal save; epic: hard save).  
**Quirk**: Tentacles writhe in and out of the skin unexpectedly.

#### Death Claw

(gloves)

A lobster-clawed gauntlet that fits over your forearm. The eyes at the fleshy joints blink unnervingly.  
**Chuulish recharge**: Reroll a missed melee attack with a +1 attack bonus (champion: +2; epic: +3).  
**Quirk**: The claw flexes and snaps reflexively when wearer is excited.

Evil Eyes

(gloves)

This gauntlet has eyes on the knuckles, aiding archers and spellcasters.  
*Always*: Bonus to attacks and damage with ranged attacks: +1 (adventurer); +2 (champion); +3 (epic). The bonus doesn’t stack with bonuses from magic weapons or implements.  
**Chuulish recharge**: Until the end of the battle or for five minutes, you can see the unseen. Invisible creatures are visible to you, and you spot illusions for what they are.  
**Quirk**: Bone ridges and oddly patterned callouses on the arms.

#### Glandular Parasite

(cloak/mantle

The parasite sits along your spine, feeding off your life force but also dampening your reactions to extreme stimuli and pain.  
*Always*: +1 PD (adventurer); +2 PD (champion); +3 PD (epic).  
**Chuulish recharge**: You are immune to fear effects until the end of the battle or for five minutes.  
**Quirk**: Strangely pronounced spine.

#### Implanted Aventail

(light armor)

The symbiote is normally hidden. When commanded, a wave of small crab-like creatures pours out of concealed gill-like openings in your skin, providing you with scale-like armor.  
*Always*: +1 AC (adventurer); +2 AC (champion); +3 AC (epic). Unleashing the armor is a quick action, and you retain the AC bonuses as long as it is in place. When the insects are retracted as a move action, you don’t appear to be (or count as) wearing armor.  
**Quirk**: Gill-like slits cover body even when the armor is not up.

#### Neural Blade

(any bladed weapon)

A boney blade with a spine and brain.  
*Always*: Bonus to attacks and damage: +1 (adventurer); +2 (champion); +3 (epic); and the weapon deals psychic damage.  
**Chuulish recharge**: Choose a nearby enemy. That enemy is now vulnerable to psychic damage until the end of the battle.  
**Quirk**: Large sphincters on arm where the ganglia-tentacles from the blade’s hilt insert themselves.

#### Neural Whip

(light one-handed melee weapon)

A tentacle snakes one end around your arm, inserting filaments beneath the skin. The whip stretches and flexes at your mental command, the tip studded with hardened pulsing nerves.  
*Always*: Bonus to attacks and damage: +1 (adventurer); +2 (champion); +3 (epic). 2/battle: You can use a reach trick with the whip (13th Age core book, page 44), and the attack deals psychic damage.  
**Quirk**: Grows eyes in unusual places.

#### Rachis Girdle

(belt)

The pulsating band of chuul-flesh inside a bony cage sits on your lower back, exchanging blood and injecting substances into your organs.  
*Always*: Increase your maximum hp by +4 (champion: +10 hp; epic: +25 hp). Whenever you take ongoing damage, reduce that damage by your level.  
**Quirk**: Odd gait from reconfigured pelvis.

#### Rasping Greaves

(boots)

A carapace covers each of your legs and has an unblinking armored eye on the knee. Unfolding blade-like appendages whip out at those engaged with you.  
*Always*: When you make an opportunity attack, the target takes +`dice: 1d6` extra damage on a hit (champion: +`dice: 2d8`; epic: +`dice: 4d10`).  
**Quirk**: A billow-like lung inside each greave makes a breathing sound.

#### Strider Symbiote

(cloak/mantle – champion tier item)

This living “backpack” clings to you with tentacles and inserts mouthparts into the top of your spine. The segmented limbs of the strider usually lie flat against your body but may be commanded to spring out and carry you like a long-legged spider.  
*Always*: +2 PD (champion); +3 PD (epic).  
**Chuulish recharge**: Until the end of the battle or for five minutes, you can move on walls or ceilings as easily as you do across the ground. (epic: chuulish recharge starts at 11+)  
**Quirk**: Twitching antenna.

#### Xenoteros

(cloak/mantle)

Insectile wings hide in slits under the always itching skin of your back.  
*Always*: +1 PD (adventurer); +2 PD (champion); +3 PD (epic).  
**Chuulish recharge**: As a standard action, you can fly clumsily for one round (champion: `dice: 1d3` + 1 rounds; epic: `dice: 2d4` rounds).  
**Quirk**: Insectile mouthparts grow at the back of the throat and squiggle out when wearer talks excitedly.
