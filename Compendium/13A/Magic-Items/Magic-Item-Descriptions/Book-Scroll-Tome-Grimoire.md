## Book, Scroll, Tome, Grimoire

Mastering a book requires a course of study and practice, usually accomplished over a day or more. Sometimes a book will reject a reader, leaving them either confounded or disturbed.

### Default Bonus

None.

#### Adventurer

##### Codex of Foreshadowed Victory

(Recharge 16+)

When you roll initiative, gain a +10 bonus to your roll after seeing it.  
**Quirk**: Jumpy.

##### Manual of Enlightened Flesh

You gain a +1 bonus to all skill checks based on Str, Con, or Dex.  
**Quirk**: Takes heightened satisfaction in their own physical prowess.

##### Scroll of the Fortuitous Outlook

(Quick action – once per battle)

Make a recharge roll for a recharge power you expended this turn (including a magic item power) If successful, you regain that power this turn.  
**Quirk**: Paranoid about the weather.

##### Scroll of Seven Subtle Serpents

(Recharge 6+)

When you make a melee attack based on Dexterity, Intelligence, or Wisdom, evoke a special ability of your choice. Pick the ability from one of the following options after seeing whether the attack is a hit.

-   Deal +`dice: 1d6` damage on a hit (champion: +`dice: 2d8`; epic: +`dice: 4d10`).
-   Deal +`dice: 1d4` damage on a miss (champion: +`dice: 2d6`; epic: +`dice: 4d8`).

-   Roll a save against an ongoing save ends effect.

**Quirk**: Always in constant motion, or swaying gently when still.

##### Scroll of the Unerring Shaft

(Recharge 11+)

When you miss with a ranged weapon attack, turn that miss into a hit, dealing your ranged basic attack damage with the attack instead.  
**Quirk**: Sings snatches of nonsense.

##### Tome of the Divinities and Their Deeds

(Recharge 16+)

When you cast a divine spell, heal using a recovery and add +`dice: 1d6` hit points to the total (champion: +`dice: 2d8` hp; epic: +`dice: 4d10` hp).  
**Quirk**: Sees the hands of the gods operating subtly through the natural and social world, and makes others aware of it.

##### Tome of the Open Mind

(Recharge 16+)

When you roll a skill check using Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma and dislike the result, reroll the check. **Quirk**: Annoyingly curious.

#### Champion

##### Manual of Puissant Skill at Arms

(Recharge 11+)

When you miss with a melee attack, reroll the attack using +15 as your attack bonus instead of your own bonus (epic: +20). If an arcane spellcaster reads this manual, it hurts their brain and permanently reduces their maximum hit points by 4 (epic: by 10).  
**Quirk**: Constantly checking self out and flexing, and seems to want to be caught doing that.

#### Epic

##### Tome of Arcane Mysteries

(Recharge 11+)

When you make an attack roll with an arcane spell, after finding out whether the attack hits, change the attack roll to a 10 instead of the natural roll. **Quirk**: Doodles insane geometrical designs.
