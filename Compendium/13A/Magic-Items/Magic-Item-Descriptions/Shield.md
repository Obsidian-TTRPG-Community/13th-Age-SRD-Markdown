## Shield

### Default Bonus

Increase your maximum hit points: by +4 (adventurer); by +10 (champion); by +25 (epic).

#### Adventurer

##### Adaptation

Whenever an enemy’s attack hits your Physical Defense or Mental Defense, you gain a +4 bonus to that defense until an attack against that defense (including the bonus) misses you, or until the end of the battle.  
**Quirk**: Takes on mannerisms of those around them.

**Quirk**: Can’t pass up an opportunity to sing.

##### Drakefanged

(Recharge 11+)

- On a hit, the attack deals `dice: 2d6` damage; on a miss, it deals 2 damage (champion: `dice: 4d8` damage, or 5 on a miss; epic: `dice: 8d10` damage, or 12 on miss).  
**Quirk**: Compares everything to dragons or to draconic things, and judges actions by how they stack up to draconic expectations.

When you make a basic melee attack, make a recharge roll for one expended power.  
**Quirk**: Tremendous appetite for meat.

##### Resilience

(Recharge 11+)

When you make a basic melee attack, heal using a recovery.  
**Quirk**: Eats an odd vegetarian diet and advocates it loudly.

##### Spiked

When you roll a natural 2 with a melee attack while using the shield, you can make a basic melee attack with the shield as a free action as if it were an off-hand weapon (use d6 damage dice).  
**Quirk**: Has shifty eyes.

##### Termination

(Recharge 6+)

When you make a basic melee attack, roll a save against one ongoing damage effect.  
**Quirk**: Continually fails to finish sentences, stopping in mid-thoug….
