## Shield

### Default Bonus

Increase your maximum hit points: by +4 (adventurer); by +10 (champion); by +25 (epic).

#### Adventurer

##### Adaptation

Whenever an enemy’s attack hits your Physical Defense or Mental Defense, you gain a +4 bonus to that defense until an attack against that defense (including the bonus) misses you, or until the end of the battle.  
**Quirk**: Takes on mannerisms of those around them.

##### Bashing

When you move to engage an enemy while using this shield, you can use the shield to push that enemy away from one of your allies engaged with it. That ally can make a disengage check as a free action.  
**Quirk**: Can’t pass up an opportunity to sing.

##### Drakefanged

(Recharge 11+)

This spiked shield sports a massive dragon fang that wounds enemies. When an enemy engaged with you misses you with a melee attack, make a basic melee attack against the enemy as a free action, with a +2 attack bonus per tier of the shield (adventurer: +2, champion: +4, epic: +6). 
- On a hit, the attack deals `dice: 2d6` damage; on a miss, it deals 2 damage (champion: `dice: 4d8` damage, or 5 on a miss; epic: `dice: 8d10` damage, or 12 on miss).  
**Quirk**: Compares everything to dragons or to draconic things, and judges actions by how they stack up to draconic expectations.

Enemies engaged with you take a –1 attack penalty against your allies.  
**Quirk**: Tends to others with too much familiarity.

##### Puissance

(Recharge 6+)

When you make a basic melee attack, make a recharge roll for one expended power.  
**Quirk**: Tremendous appetite for meat.

##### Resilience

(Recharge 11+)

When you make a basic melee attack, heal using a recovery.  
**Quirk**: Eats an odd vegetarian diet and advocates it loudly.

##### Spiked

When you roll a natural 2 with a melee attack while using the shield, you can make a basic melee attack with the shield as a free action as if it were an off-hand weapon (use d6 damage dice).  
**Quirk**: Has shifty eyes.

##### Termination

(Recharge 6+)

When you make a basic melee attack, roll a save against one ongoing damage effect.  
**Quirk**: Continually fails to finish sentences, stopping in mid-thoug….
