## Necklace, Pendant

### Default Bonus

+1 to saves when you have 10 hp or fewer (adventurer); 25 hp or fewer (champion); 50 hp or fewer (epic).

#### Adventurer

##### Bearclaw

(Recharge 11+)

When you hit with a melee attack while you’re staggered, gain 10 temporary hit points (champion: 25 temporary hp; epic: 50 temporary hp).  
**Quirk**: Swaggers even when overmatched.

##### Cups

When you’re drunk, you don’t accidentally say or do stupid things that you regret in the morning, and your head doesn’t hurt so bad.  
**Quirk**: Not reluctant to drink excessively in public.

##### Last Legs

You gain a +1 bonus to saves whenever you have one or fewer recoveries left (champion: two or fewer, epic: three or fewer).  
**Quirk**: Loves long-shot bets.

##### Lifestone

The stones in the necklace breathe, ever so slightly. You gain a +5 bonus to death saves, if failure would kill you. You also gain a +5 bonus to last gasp saves.  
**Quirk**: Chides others for taking risks when they have lesser magical protection.

##### Momentous Harmony

The pendant brings out the best in other magic items you carry, so that their quirks turn more positive, or at least become weaker if they cause trouble. If you go over your magic item limit, the pendant ceases to function (including the default bonus) and the formerly subdued magic items express themselves with renewed fervor.  
**Quirk**: Treats all their magic items well—talks to them as if they’re alive, refers to them as “children,” etc.

##### Paragon

(Recharge 16+)

This necklace changes shape and jewels depending on the race of the wearer. When you use this necklace, you gain another use of your racial power in the battle.  
**Quirk**: Sometimes unwittingly speaks in a language that sounds like it could be the original language of their race, if anyone else could understand it.

##### Water Breathing

(Recharge 6+)

This band of aquamarine and pearls enables you to breathe water for a short time, usually about five minutes. The effect wears off slowly, so you’ll have warning to get to the surface.  
**Quirk**: Hiccups in stressful situations.
