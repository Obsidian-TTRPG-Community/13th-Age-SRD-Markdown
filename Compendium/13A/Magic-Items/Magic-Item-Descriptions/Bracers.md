## Bracers

Bracers occupy the same chakra as magic melee weapons.

Monks get magic-weapon style powers from magical bracers. A monk wearing magical bracers can’t use a magical melee weapon at the same time. 

Non-monks generally don’t benefit from bracers.

Bracers have the same types of powers as other melee weapons. Use the melee weapon magic items to determine bracer powers, and assign one of the following monk-specific quirks.

-   Speaks too often in terse shouted syllables.
-   So disciplined that dancing, hanging out, and even sitting down is a mental hurdle.
-   Unable to sleep without performing an exhausting workout first.
-   Certain that intimacy with another being depletes one’s ki.
-   Unable to avoid helping smaller innocent creatures in distress.
-   Always rises at least an hour earlier than everyone else in their group, community, or adventuring band.
-   Unable to curse or say negative things about people, even if they are true.
-   Uncomfortable sleeping in the same spot they slept in the night before.
-   Likes to paint watercolors in their spare time.
-   Longs for victory in official martial tournaments.
-   Trash-talks during battle.
-   Tells detailed stories about great martial arts battles of previous centuries.
-   Always uses a quick action to pose over the prone body of a just-defeated foe.
-   Corrects everyone else’s posture, sometimes even in the middle of battle.
-   Has a fondness for sweets, followed by a punishment regimen of only fish soup.
-   Compelled to climb stairs using their hands instead of feet.
-   Insists on always moving silently, breezing in and out of situations that in social terms require small noises and acknowledgements.
-   Can’t abide “fancy” food without heartburn (or at least complaints of heartburn).
-   Insists on being the first to go into a room.
