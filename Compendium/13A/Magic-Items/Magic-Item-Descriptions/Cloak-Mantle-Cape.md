## Cloak, Mantle, Cape

### Default Bonus

Physical defense: +1 PD (adventurer); +2 PD (champion); +3 PD (epic).

#### Adventurer

##### Adroit Avoidance

(Recharge 6+)

When an attack or effect deals ongoing damage to you that a save ends, you can roll an immediate save against it.  
**Quirk**: Doesn’t notice social slights or insults.

##### Elven

Add +4 to checks to hide in natural surroundings.  
**Quirk**: Prefers the finest things in life; of course, they are elven.

##### Evasion

(Recharge 6+)

When you take damage from an opportunity attack, take 20 less damage from it (champion: 40; epic: 100)  
**Quirk**: You can’t answer a question directly even if you want to.

##### Recovery

(Quick action – recharge 16+)

You heal using a recovery and add +4 hp to the total (champion: +10 hp; epic: +25 hp).  
**Quirk**: You grow small extra appendages that slowly wither away over days or weeks.

##### Shelter

This long cloak with a full hood keeps you warm and dry, regardless of the elements, barring full immersion in water or other liquid.  
**Quirk**: Prefers the outdoors.

##### Stalwart

(Recharge 16+)

When an attack against your Physical Defense hits, make the attacker reroll the attack and use a PD of 15 instead (champion: 20; epic: 25).  
**Quirk**: Always the last to retreat or avoid danger.

#### Champion

##### Guardian

(Recharge 11+)

When a foe you’re engaged with targets your ally with an attack that doesn’t include you, make that enemy target you instead of that ally. Declare your choice before the attack is rolled. (Epic: recharge 6+.)  
**Quirk**: Compelled to the defense of others, even those who might not need defending.

#### Epic

##### Inviolability

(Recharge 16+)

When an attack against your Physical Defense hits, change that hit into a miss instead.  
**Quirk**: Attempts stunts of toughness and daring that a person less convinced of their invulnerability might be wise enough to avoid.
