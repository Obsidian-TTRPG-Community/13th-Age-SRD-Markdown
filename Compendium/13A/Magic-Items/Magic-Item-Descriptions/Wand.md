## Wand

Wands are only appropriate for adventurer- and champion-level characters. 
- For epic-level spellcasting items, **get a staff**.

## Default Bonus

Attack and damage with arcane spells or attacks: +1 (adventurer); +2 (champion).

### Adventurer

#### Body Breaking, Dagger of

This rune-covered bronze dagger also works as a wand. When you cast an arcane attack spell using this dagger/wand, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage with that spell if it targets PD.  
**Quirk**: Scratches self unnervingly.

#### Flaring Wand

(Quick action – recharge 11+)

When the escalation die is 5+, cast one of your arcane spells. That spell will miss on any natural odd roll.  
**Quirk**: Often looks frazzled.

#### Infighting, Wand of

When you cast an arcane attack spell using this wand, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage with that spell if it’s a close-quarters spell. **Quirk**: Physically pushy.

#### Mage’s Invisible Aegis, Wand of the

(Recharge 16+)

When you use this wand, you can cast the wizard’s shield spell, with a level no higher than your level. (Champion: recharge 11+).  
**Quirk**: Hums tunelessly.

#### Mindbending, Wand of

When you cast an arcane attack spell using this wand, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage with that spell if it targets Mental Defense.  
**Quirk**: Uses pedantically circumlocutious phraseology.

#### Unfettered Minion, Wand of

(Quick action – recharge: 11+)

When you use this wand, a creature who is at least somewhat subservient to you gains a +1 bonus to melee attacks and damage until the end of the battle (champion: +2 bonus).  
**Quirk**: Switches unexpectedly into “evil mastermind” tone of voice.

### Champion

#### Wand of Unerring Pain

(See below – recharge 16+): When you miss with a spell that targets a single enemy, as a quick action immediately afterward, fire a magical missile that automatically hits that creature for `dice: 4d10` force damage.  
**Quirk**: Stares intently, often at nothing.
