## Helmet, Crown, Diadem, Circlet

### Default Bonus

Mental defense: +1 MD (adventurer); +2 MD (champion); +3 MD (epic).

#### Adventurer

##### Circlet of Approachability

While wearing this circlet, in regular social situations, you appear to others as someone who belongs there. You easily fit in with new groups of people, unless there is some particular reason for others to be suspicious. The circlet has no power in unusual social situations.  
**Quirk**: Peppers speech with needless foreign words.

###### Helm of Fortunate Dodging

(Recharge 11+, and see below)

When an enemy misses you with an attack against your AC or PD, change that miss into a fumble (no damage or possibly a negative outcome).  
**Quirk**: Easily moved to dancing by rhythmic music, and taps foot when there is no music.

##### Helm of Psychic Armor

(Recharge 16+)

When an attack that targets Mental Defense hits you, cancel the attack’s non-damage effects against you.  
**Quirk**: Won’t stop going on about “the amazing dream I had last night.”

##### Helm of Psychic Retribution

(Recharge 16+)

When an enemy misses you with an attack that targets Mental Defense, deal 10 psychic damage to that enemy (champion: 25 damage; epic: 60 damage).  
**Quirk**: Stares into space often.

##### Helm of the Undaunted Hero

(Recharge 6+): When your turn starts, roll a save against one ongoing save ends effect.  
**Quirk**: Favors traditional battle hymns.

##### Skullcap of Wit

You can banter with a lively wit. If you already have a lively wit, it doesn’t make much of a difference. Interpret this ability narrowly enough that it might provide a bonus to a die roll that anyone really cares about only once in a campaign.  
**Quirk**: Banters with lively wit.

#### Epic

##### Crown of the Mighty Strike

(Recharge 16+)

This slim but elegant crown wants to share your glory and thus needs you to be glorious. It continually presses you to take bold actions. If the escalation die is 3+, use your next daily attack power this battle as a quick action.  
**Quirk**: Likely to make bold statements or undertake bold actions, especially by reflex.
