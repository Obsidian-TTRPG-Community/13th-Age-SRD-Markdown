## Arrow and Crossbow Bolt and Slingstone

In general, ammunition is one-use, hit or miss. It also doesn’t take up a chakra, and, like other one-use items, ammunition doesn’t confer quirks on its user.

### Default Bonus

Expands crit range by 1 (adventurer, champion, and epic tier, always a 1-point expansion rather than 1 point per tier). Ammunition takes the bonus of the weapon that shoots it, just like mundane ammunition does.

### Adventurer

#### Energy

This ammunition has been enchanted with one of the following types of energy: acid, cold, fire, holy, lightning, thunder. An attack using this ammunition deals that type of damage.

#### Forceful Impact

When you hit with an attack using this ammunition, the target also pops free from each enemy engaged with it.

#### Keen

When you make an attack with this ammunition, the crit range of that attack expands by 1 (usually 18+ including the default bonus).

#### Lethal Strike

You deal +`dice: 1d10` damage on a hit (champion: +`dice: 2d10`; epic: +`dice: 4d10`).

#### Lucky Stray

On a miss, you can make a basic ranged attack against another foe that is near the target or along your line of sight to the target (between you and the original target or past the original target).

#### Nemesis

This ammunition has been enchanted against one of the following groups of monsters: dragon, giant, orc, or undead. An attack against the designated nemesis with this ammunition can be rerolled once if it misses. When you use this ammunition, however, it allows each monster of the same group to reroll one attack against you that misses this battle. If you use this type of ammunition two or more times against the same creature group this battle, monsters of that type can instead reroll each attack against you that misses this battle (once per attack).

#### Seeking

You deal +4 damage on a miss (champion: +10; epic: +25).

#### Twin

When you attack with twin ammunition, a second projectile materializes out of the first and targets the same or a different enemy. Make a free action basic ranged attack for it with a +8 attack bonus instead of your normal bonus (champion: +12; epic: +16).

#### Vulnerability

When you hit with an attack using this ammunition, if the target is from the same tier or lower than the ammunition, it’s also vulnerable to all attacks until the start of your next turn.

#### Wing-clipper

When you hit with an attack using this ammunition, if the target is from the same tier or lower than the ammunition, it loses the *flight* ability (save ends). If the target is presently flying, it must attempt to land during its next turn.

### Champion

#### Flaming

Bursts into fire as it flies. You deal 8 extra ongoing fire damage on a hit (epic: 20 ongoing fire).

### Epic

#### Death

When you hit with this ammunition and deal damage, if the target has 40 hp or fewer after the hit, the creature drops to 0 hp. If it hits but fails to drop its target, the ammunition is not used up. It must of course be retrieved.

#### Uncanny

It warps the forces of necessity and miracle as it flies. When you attack with this ammunition, use the target’s lowest defense instead of the defense your attack would normally target.
