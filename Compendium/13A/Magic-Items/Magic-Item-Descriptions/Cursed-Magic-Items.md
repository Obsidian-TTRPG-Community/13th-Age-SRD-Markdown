## Cursed Magic Items

Cursed items can be useful, though all of them have significant drawbacks.

### Shadow Dragons

Players will often find cursed items such as these when approaching a Shadow Dragon lair. However, detecting the curse on any of these cursed items requires a DC 35 Intelligence check:

**30 or less:** Nothing seems to be wrong.

**31–34:** Something isn’t right about the item. It could be cursed, or just has a bad quirk.

**35+ or natural 20:** The item is cursed!

**Natural roll is 1–5:** The creature attempting to discern the item’s magic accidentally attunes to the cursed item!

#### General

##### Dancing Shoes

(boots)

Shiny red shoes with golden wings.  
*Always:* The shoes force you to dance whenever you hear music (even off-key whistling will work). The shoes magically re-appear on your feet if taken off for more than 10 minutes.  
*Recharge 6+:* You gain a +3 bonus to disengage checks until the end of the battle (or five minutes).

##### Deck of Many Cards

(wondrous item)

A divination deck.  
*Always:* The deck of cards continually grows, and you find your pockets and pouches filling with cards that spill out leaving a trail for anyone to follow. Occasionally, the cards spill out in a prophetic pattern that might have meaning to the owner or an ally.

##### Disappointment Hat

(hat)

Green conical hat.  
*Always:* Each time you cast a spell outside of combat or a spell is cast near you, it has some side effect (GM’s choice) that inconveniences you.  
*Recharge 6+:* As a move action you pull out an item from the hat. 
- Roll a d6 to see what you get: 
	- **1-2**: You get a useless or disgusting item. 
	- **3–6**: You pull a useful non-magical item that grants a +d6 bonus to your next skill check until the end of your next turn.

##### Tome of Misfortune

(implement)

Book with an embossed face inside its cover.  
*1/day:* Regain one expended daily spell that you have cast.  
When you cast the recovered spell, roll a d6. 
- **1–3**: The book chooses the targets for the spell and can consider you and your allies as enemies, or your enemies as allies. 
- **4–6**: You choose targets normally.

##### Treasured Chest

(wondrous item)

It follows you on little feet, obeys you, and is much larger on the inside (able to hold the same amount of stuff as a large closet).  
*Always:* You can’t move faster than the chest, and the chest is slow. You travel at half speed everywhere and can’t use actions to move twice during a turn in battle.

#### Adventurer

##### Acrobat’s Stick

(staff)

A glowing rod that expands into a longer pole.  
*Always:* Bonus to attacks and damage: +2 (adventurer). In addition, if you are a rogue with the *swashbuckle* ability, you gain an extra use of that ability, but whenever you roll a natural 1 or 2 with any d20 roll, the staff flings you into danger (you take 2d6 damage and possibly provoke opportunity attacks in battle).

##### Anger Armor

(heavy armor)

Platemail or similar with leering faces on the pauldrons.  
*Always:* +2 AC (adventurer). In addition, when you miss with an attack and the escalation die is odd, roll a save; on a failure, you are enraged until the start of your next turn and take a –4 penalty to all defences.

##### Backbiter Bow

(bow)

Gold bow with no string. It creates a glowing string and “energy arrows.”  
*Always:* Bonus to attacks and damage: +2 (adventurer). In addition, when you miss with an attack and the escalation die is odd, roll a save; on a failure, you instead hit yourself with the attack.

##### Blade of Unerring Panache

(+2 weapon)

When you attack with this weapon and miss, you lose 4 hp (champion: 10 hp; epic: 25 hp).  
**Quirk**: Tells the same stories over and over.

##### Sword of Relentless Glory

(+2 weapon)

If you don’t make a melee attack with this weapon during your turn, it shuts down and its default bonus becomes +0 until the end of the battle.  
**Quirk**: Spouts furious curses in battle.

##### Wand of the Bloodless Mage

(+2 implement)

When you attack using this wand, you lose 1 hp (champion: 3 hp; epic: 6 hp).  
**Quirk**: Laughs turn hollow or spectral.

#### Champion

Any adventurer cursed item bumped up, or…

##### Axe of Bloody Vengeance

(+3 weapon)

You cannot rally during a battle.  
**Quirk**: Carves patterns into own skin with fingernails.

##### Bait Breastplate

(any armor)

Thick metal plate cuirass that attracts ranged attacks and spells even as it deflects melee attacks.  
*Always:* +3 AC (champion) against melee attacks, but –1 AC against ranged attacks.

##### Brazen Armor

(+3 armor)

When an attack against your AC crits you, the armor “goes quiet” and its default bonus becomes +0 until the end of the battle.  
**Quirk**: Becomes unreliable with forgettable tasks.

##### Cudgel of Heedlessness

(heavy two-handed melee weapon)

A strangely glowing crude wooden club.  
*Always:* Bonus to attacks and damage: +3 (champion). In addition, when you roll a natural 1 with a melee attack using this weapon, you hit a random nearby ally with that attack and deal maximum damage. If you try to use a different weapon, the cudgel will teleport into your hand.

##### Ring of Delusion

(ring)

Ring made out of complex interlocking wooden pieces.  
*Always:* Whenever there are two possible explanations and one is obviously ridiculous, that is what you believe provided there is no obvious and direct proof that contradicts your delusion. In addition, you gain +3 bonus to checks to find traps and see through illusions.

#### Epic

Any lower item bumped up, or… 

##### Chicken Shield

(shield)

A fancy cavalier’s shield.  
*Always:* +35 hp (epic). In addition, when you miss with an attack and the escalation die is odd, roll a save; on a failure, you run away from that enemy as far as you can go (no disengage check, take opportunity attacks).

##### Danger Bracers

(light armor)

Chains welded into forearm armor.  
*Always:* +4 AC (epic). In addition, you can’t disengage from enemies.

##### Procrastination Tome

(implement)

This book contains instructions for being a better spellcaster.  
*Always:* Bonus to spell attacks and damage: +5 (epic). In addition, during the first round of each battle you must spend all your actions either moving or “limbering up.” This means not using any abilities, you’re just jogging and stretching.

##### Great Low Sickle

(+5 weapon)

You deal +5 damage with missed attacks, but all of your defences take a –3 penalty.

##### Staff of Dark Karma

(3/day)

When you hit with a spell attack, deal extra damage to one target. If the spell targets one enemy, deal +`dice: 4d10` damage. Otherwise, deal +`dice: 2d10` damage. In addition, the first time you take damage each battle, you lose 20 hp.
