#### Adventurer

##### Abandon

(Melee weapon)

You deal +`dice: 2d6` damage with your first attack each battle using this weapon (champion: +`dice: 4d6`; epic: +`dice: 4d12`).  
**Quirk**: Blurts out obscenities. (For decorum’s sake, use euphemisms when speaking in character.)

##### Bloodthirsty

(Any weapon)

**Quirk**: Has taste for red meat.

##### Certain Pain

(Two-handed melee weapon – recharge 11+)

Before making an attack with this weapon, designate it as a “pain” attack. On a hit with that attack, one target takes 10 extra damage. On a miss, you take 10 damage (champion: 25 damage; epic: 60 damage).  
**Quirk**: Fond of gambling.

##### Climactic Shot

(Ranged weapon – recharge 6+)

When the escalation die is 3+ and you hit with an attack using this weapon, the target takes 10 extra damage (champion: 25 damage; epic: 60 damage).  
**Quirk**: Can’t stop checking the weapon and its ammunition.

##### Cruel

**Quirk**: Tortures flies. 

##### Dexterous Parry

(One-handed melee weapon – recharge 11+)

**Quirk**: Jumpy and suspicious.

##### Distraction

While the escalation die is 3+, you deal +`dice: 1d8` damage whenever you hit with this weapon (champion: +`dice: 2d8`; epic: +`dice: 4d8`).  
**Quirk**: Favors iron and steel, seeing little beauty in gold or gems.

##### Haughty

(Any weapon)

When you hit with an attack using this weapon, if that enemy is the most dangerous foe in the battle (or tied for most dangerous, GM’s assessment), you deal +`dice: 1d4` per tier damage to it (champion: +`dice: 1d8` per tier; epic: +`dice: 1d10` per tier).  
**Quirk**: Challenges others to improvised contests.

##### Inimical

(Any weapon)

When you hit with this weapon, you can deal +`dice: 1d10` damage to that enemy (champion: +`dice: 2d10`; epic: +`dice: 4d10`). If you do, you also take that extra damage.  
**Quirk**: Bites nails, or a similar darker habit.

##### Liberation

If you have attacked with this weapon this turn, allow an ally to roll a save against an ongoing save ends effect as a free action.  
**Quirk**: Drones on about how healing grace will save all the worlds.

**Quirk**: Yells battle cries during battle.

##### Mighty Swing

(Two-handed melee weapon – move action)

You deal +1d8 damage with your next melee attack with this weapon that hits this turn (champion: +`dice: 2d8`; epic: +4d8). If you miss, you take that damage instead.  
**Quirk**: Tends to break things.

##### No Mercy

(Ranged weapon)

If your target is attempting to flee from the battle, a natural even hit against it is a critical hit instead.  
**Quirk**: Develops a surprising lip-curl sneer that shows up a bit too often.

##### Protection

When you make a basic attack with this weapon, gain a +4 bonus to all defences until the end of your next turn (champion: +5; epic: +6).  
**Quirk**: Has urges to watch over the helpless or innocent.

##### Puissance

(Melee weapon – recharge 16+)

When you make a basic attack with this weapon, make a recharge roll for one power.  
**Quirk**: Tremendous appetite for meat.

##### Steady

(Ranged weapon – recharge 11+)

Before rolling a ranged attack with this weapon, choose 10 as the natural roll for that attack.  
**Quirk**: Talks too much about the weather.

##### Unstinting Virtue

(Melee weapon – recharge 11+)

When you make a basic attack with this weapon, roll a save against a save ends effect.

If your elven grace racial ability roll failed this turn, use the natural result of this bow’s attack roll as another elven grace roll, after you see the roll.  
**Quirk**: Complains too often that the glorious centuries of old are gone forever.

##### Mighty Stunning

(One-handed blunt `dice: 1d6` melee weapon – recharge 16+)

When you roll a natural even hit with this weapon and have more hit points than the target, that creature is also stunned until the end of its next turn.  
**Quirk**: Warns of impending doom.

##### Reckless

(Melee weapon – recharge 6+)

Reroll one of your attack rolls with a +4 bonus. In addition, until the end of the battle, enemies attacking you add the escalation die to their attack roll (no effect if the enemy already adds it for some reason).  
**Quirk**: Low impulse control, particularly when it comes to impulsive movements through doors, onto railings, or over tables.

#### Epic

##### Greatsword of Utter Night

(+3 greatsword – recharge 6+)

When you hit with this weapon, you spirit away that enemy and yourself to an empty void beyond time where only the two of you face each other for a short time. Neither you nor your foe can move, but you can sure fight. Your enemy acts first, then you, and then you are both spirited back to the real world exactly where you were when the power triggered. Bystanders only see a flash of black.  
**Quirk**: Has disturbing dreams that can’t be remembered, or at the very least must not be.

##### Incomparable Axe of Wyrm Chopping

(+3 axe)

Whenever you attack a dragon with the axe, you deal +40 damage, hit or miss. The GM determines just how broadly the term “dragon” applies.  
**Quirk**: Speaks in Draconic, first just curses, but then more and more elements of speech.
