## Staff

A staff counts as both a wand (arcane spells) and a symbol (divine spells). 
- Staffs are champion or epic items only. 
- Epic staffs don’t like to be around lesser staffs, and do not abide wands.

### Default Bonus

Attack and damage with an arcane or divine spell or attack: +2 (champion); +3 (epic).

#### Champion

##### Diabolical Staff

(Recharge: 16+, but see below)

You can evoke the power of the staff to gain additional attention and power from the spirits of darkness. When you roll relationship dice with a villainous icon, treat a single 4 as a 5. If you don’t roll a 4, the staff recharges automatically during your next quick rest.  
**Quirk**: Exaggerates a chaotic or destructive trait that is already there.

##### Staff of Health

When you cast spells that heal or provide temporary hit points, add 4 to the total (epic: 8).  
**Quirk**: The diseased of nearly every population center somehow know to seek you out for healing.

##### Staff of the Diffident Magician

(Recharge 6+)

The first time an enemy engages you, make an opportunity attack against that enemy. On a hit, you deal +2d8 damage with that attack (epic: +4d10) and daze the foe until the end of its turn, if the creature is large or smaller (epic: any size).  
**Quirk**: Doesn’t like to be touched.

##### Staff of the God’s Riches

(Recharge 16+)

When you cast a cleric spell using this staff, you can cast the spell both *for* *power* and *for* *broad* *effect* (if applicable), choosing different targets.  
**Quirk**: Careless with money.

##### Staff of Manipulation

When you cast an attack spell using this staff, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage with that spell if it has any additional negative effect on the target(s) besides damage (including ongoing damage).  
**Quirk**: Expects to be treated with respect.

##### Staff of Massacres

When you cast an attack spell using this staff, you gain a +1 attack bonus with that spell if it has more than one target.  
**Quirk**: Obsessed with numbers and calculations.

##### Staff of the Uncrowned King

(Recharge 6+)

When you use this power, you automatically succeed on a save against an effect created or caused by an undead enemy.  
**Quirk**: You see dead people…sometimes.

#### Epic

##### Staff of the Imperium

(Standard action – recharge 16+)

The power of this golden staff can only be invoked by a spellcaster who has a positive or conflicted relationship with any ruling icon. When you use this power, you can use the power of any other magic item you have touched since your last full heal-up, but you can only use each such individual item power once ever.  
**Quirk**: Becomes certain that they are destined to rule.
