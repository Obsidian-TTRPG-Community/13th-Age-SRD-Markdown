## True Magic Items

[[Compendium/13A/Magic-Items/Magic-Items|Magic items]] are permanently enchanted objects. You can find them during an adventure or receive them as gifts and rewards from NPCs, but you’ll seldom find anyone willing to sell one.

### Magic Item Personalities & Quirks

Every magic item in is alive, in a sense, and possesses a personality you have to interact with when you start using the item, establishing and maintaining a rapport with it. What that rapport means varies from item to item and is usually controlled by the GM. Some items talk with their user. Others communicate in bursts of emotion or slight motion.

Each item has a personality that is largely defined by its quirk. What you can count on as a default is that nearly all magic items want to be used and used well.

As an adventuring hero, you can handle a number of true magic items equal to your level. Items one tier above you count as two items, and epic items count as three items if you are an adventurer tier character.

If you are carrying and wielding a number of items that is equal to or lower than your current level, the magic item personality quirks will tug at you, giving you sudden urges and desires that will feel natural to give in to. But you’ll be in charge.

If you are carrying and wielding a number of items that is greater than your current level, the magic item personality quirks are going to have more power over you. You’re no longer running the show; instead, the magic items are, to some extent, running you. Herein lies a roleplaying challenge for the player and the GM.
