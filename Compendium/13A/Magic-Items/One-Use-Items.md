## One-use Items

The common types of one-use items include potions, oils, and runes.

### Potions

You can buy potions that fall in the tier of the environment you’re in. You can carry as many potions as you wish. Drinking a potion takes a [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Sequence/Actions-on-Your-Turn/Standard-Move-and-Quick-Actions/Standard-Move-and-Quick-Actions|standard action]], even if you don’t have it in hand already. Feeding a potion to an [unconscious](Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Damage-and-Healing/Unconscious.md) ally is also a standard action.

You can only be under the effect of a single potion at a time. If you’re using a potion that has a lingering effect, drinking another potion ends the first effect. Non-healing potions tend to have effects that last until the end of a battle, or around five minutes if you’re prepping for a battle and drinking potions beforehand.

#### Healing Potions

A healing potion lets the creature drinking it heal using one of their [recoveries](Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Damage-and-Healing/Recoveries.md). Potions provide bonus healing on top of what you’d generally get with a recovery, but there’s a hit point cap for the maximum healing you can get from a potion, no matter how well you roll your recovery.

##### Healing Potion Costs

| Tier       | Cost   | Effec            | HP Cap |
| ---------- | ------ | ---------------- | ------ |
| Adventurer | 50 gp  | Recovery +`dice: 1d8` hp | 30     |
| Champion   | 100 gp | Recovery +`dice: 2d8` hp | 60     |
| Epic       | 200 gp | Recovery +`dice: 3d8` hp | 100    |
| Iconic     | 300 gp | Recovery +`dice: 4d8` hp | 130    |

#### Potion of [Energy] Resistance

When you drink one of these potions, you gain [resistance](Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Special-Attacks-and-Effects/Resistance.md) to a single specified energy type dealt by creatures or hazards of a specific tier for the rest of the battle or for five minutes. 
- [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Special-Attacks-and-Effects/Resistance|Resistance]] from a potion is always 16+. 
- Attackers of the tier covered, or lower, must roll a natural 16 or higher on their attack roll to overcome your resistance and do full damage of a type you’re resistant to, otherwise they deal half damage. 
- Damage from a source that’s a higher tier than your potion ignores your resistance. See [Resistance](Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Special-Attacks-and-Effects/Resistance.md). 

For the types of resistance available, see [Other Damage Types](Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Stats/Other-Damage-Types.md).

##### Resistance Potion Costs

| Tier | Resistance | Cost   |
| ---- | ---------- | ------ |
| Adventurer     | Resist 16+ | 100 gp |
| Champion      | Resist 16+ | 200 gp |
|   Epic   | Resist 16+ | 400 gp |

### Oils

While potions affect creatures, magic oils affect items. Oils provide temporary magical enhancement to weapons, armour, and spellcasters’ implements.

It’s a quick action to pour magic oil on your weapon, implement, or armour. The effect lasts until the end of a battle or for five minutes before fading.

Each oil confers a bonus of +1 (adventurer), +2 (champion), or +3 (epic). Used on a weapon or a spellcasting implement, the bonus applies to attack and damage rolls. Used on armor, the bonus applies to [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Stats/defences/Armor-Class|AC]].

Bonuses from oils don’t stack with magic items’ inherent bonuses. Use the higher bonus.

| Tier 	| Bonus 	| Cost 	|  
|---	|---	|---	|  
| Adventurer 	| +1 Oil 	| 100 gp 	|  
| Champion 	| +2 Oil 	| 200 gp 	|  
| Epic 	| +3 Oil 	| 400 gp 	|

### Runes

Runes function exactly like magical oils, but in addition to the expected +1/+2/+3 bonus, each rune also provides an additional random enhancement to the item it is applied to. Roll for the effect when the rune is applied to the item. An item can only have one rune applied to it at a time.

#### Rune Costs

| Tier 	| Bonus 	| Cost 	|  
|---	|---	|---	|  
| Adventurer 	| +1 Rune 	| 150 gp 	|  
| Champion 	| +2 Rune 	| 300 gp 	|  
| Epic 	| +3 Rune 	| 600 gp  	|
