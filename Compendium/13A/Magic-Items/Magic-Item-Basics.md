## Magic Item Basics

Some [[Compendium/13A/Magic-Items/Magic-Items|magic items]] are available at any level, with greater bonuses or other effects for champion- and epic-tier versions. Others can be found only at champion or epic levels.

### Default Bonuses

Default Bonuses are on unless they specify otherwise. Magic necklaces have the only default bonus that is defined as provisional, a save bonus that kicks in when your [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Stats/Hit-Points|hit points]] are low.

### Magic Item Powers

Unless otherwise specified, magic item powers with a recharge chance have to be activated and require a free action to use. They will also have a trigger condition that you must meet to use the item.

Magic item powers that do not specify a recharge chance or a specific usage pattern have powers that are always available.

The majority of magic item powers list a recharge number (6+, 11+, or 16+). You can count on using a recharge power once a day, but subsequent uses depend on successful recharge rolls. After the battle in which you’ve used an item’s power, roll a d20. 
- If your roll equals or exceeds the recharge number for that item, you can use that item power again that day. 
- If the roll fails, the item power is expended until you take a full heal-up.
