### Basic Attacks

#### Melee Attack

**Target:** One enemy

**Miss:** Damage equal to your level

#### Ranged Attack

At-Will  
**Target:** One enemy  
**Attack:** Dexterity + Level vs. AC  
**Hit:** WEAPON + Dexterity damage

### Class Talents

Choose three of the following class talents, or put two talents into Animal Companion, and one talent elsewhere.

You get an additional ranger class talent at 5th level, and again at 8th level.

#### Animal Companion

**Special:** Unlike most class talents, this talent can take up to two ranger class talent slots. Spending one talent makes you an Animal Companion initiate. Spending two makes you an Animal Companion adept.

You have a normal-sized animal companion that fights alongside you in battle. See Animal Companion Rules.

If you would rather have a smaller beast as a pet, see the Ranger’s Pet talent.

#### Archery

Once per battle, reroll one of your missed ranged attacks.

##### Adventurer Feat

Your Archery rerolls gain a +2 attack bonus and the attack’s crit range expands by 1.

##### Champion Feat

Once per day, you can use Archery twice in the same battle.

##### Epic Feat

Once per day, you can turn a normal hit with a ranger ranged attack into a critical hit.

#### Double Melee Attack

When fighting with two one-handed melee weapons, your default option is to make a double melee attack.

Your weapon damage die drops one notch, usually from d8s to d6s. If your first attack is a natural even roll (hit or miss), you can make a second attack as a free action.

If you decide you don’t want to try for a double melee attack while fighting with two one-handed weapons, declare it before rolling your attack; the single attack will deal the normal damage dice instead of using reduced damage dice.

##### Adventurer Feat

Your second attack gains a +2 attack bonus if it is against a different target.

##### Champion Feat

Once per battle, use Double Melee Attack after an odd attack roll.

##### Epic Feat

Each turn, you can pop free of one enemy before one attack roll that is part of a Double Melee Attack. You can also use your move action in between your two attacks if you wish.

#### Double Ranged Attack

When you attack with a ranged weapon that does not need to be reloaded, your default option is to make a double ranged attack.

Your weapon damage die drops one notch, usually from d8s to d6s. If your first attack is a natural even roll (hit or miss), you can make a second attack as a free action.

If you decide you don’t want to try for a double ranged attack when firing your bow or other ranged weapon, declare it before rolling your attack; the single attack will deal the normal damage dice instead of using reduced damage dice.

##### Adventurer Feat

Your second attack gains a +2 attack bonus if it is against a different target.

##### Champion Feat

Once per battle, you can use Double Ranged Attack after an odd attack roll.

##### Epic Feat

Each turn, you can pop free of one enemy before one attack roll that is part of a Double Ranged Attack. You can also use your move action in between your two attacks if you wish.

#### Favored Enemy

Choose a specific monster type (e.g. aberration, beast, construct, demon, devil, dragon, elemental, giant, humanoid\, ooze, plant, spirit, or undead)**. The crit range of your ranger attacks against that type of enemy expands by 2.

> [!warning] Humanoid Favored Enemy  
> Unlike other favored enemies, choosing humanoid as your favored enemy takes up **two** ranger class talent slots.

##### Adventurer Feat

You can change your favored enemy by meditating when you take a full heal-up.

##### Champion Feat

Your crit range for attacks against favored enemies expands by 1 (to +3).

##### Epic Feat

Choose a second non-humanoid monster type as a favored enemy.

#### Fey Queen’s Enchantments

Choose one daily or recharge spell of your level or lower from the sorcerer class. You can cast this spell as if you were a sorcerer (though you can’t gather power).

##### Adventurer Feat

You can choose which ability score you want to use as the attack ability for sorcerer spells you can cast.

##### Champion Feat

You can now choose from sorcerer at-will spells.

##### Epic Feat

You gain an additional sorcerer spell of your choice that is your level or lower; a total of two from this talent.

#### First Strike

The first time you attack an enemy during a battle, your crit range for that attack expands by 2 (usually to 18+). A mob of mooks counts as a single enemy.

##### Adventurer Feat

The crit range of your First Strike attacks expands by 1 (to +3).

##### Champion Feat

Once per day, deal triple damage with a First Strike crit instead of double damage.

##### Epic Feat

Whenever you hit with a First Strike attack, you can reroll your damage once and use the higher roll.

#### Lethal Hunter

Once per battle as a free action, choose an enemy. The crit range of your attacks against that enemy expands by 2 for the rest of the battle. A mob of mooks counts as a single enemy.

##### Adventurer Feat

The crit range of your Lethal Hunter attacks expands by 1 (to +3).

##### Champion Feat

One battle per day, you can use Lethal Hunter against two different enemies.

##### Epic Feat

Your Lethal Hunter crits deal triple damage instead of double damage while the escalation die is 3+.

#### Ranger Ex Cathedral

Choose one daily or recharge spell of your level or lower from the cleric class. You can cast this spell as if you were a cleric. You can change your chosen spell each time you take a full heal-up.

##### Adventurer Feat

You can cast the cleric class feature *heal* spell once per battle.

##### Champion Feat

You can now choose from cleric at-will spells.

##### Epic Feat

You gain an additional cleric spell of your choice that is your level or lower; a total of two from this talent.

#### Ranger’s Pet

You have a small animal or beast that accompanies you on your adventures. Use the rules from the Wizard’s Familiar talent with the following differences:

1.  The creature is your pet or friend instead of your familiar.
2.  Your pet is fully natural rather than partially magical.
3.  Your pet can end up with more abilities, if you choose.

##### Adventurer Feat

Your pet gains a third ability.

##### Champion Feat

Your pet gains a fourth ability.

##### Epic Feat

Your pet gains a fifth ability.

#### Tracker

You have the Tracker background at its full possible bonus of +5, without having to spend your normal background points on it. You are an expert wilderness tracker, capable of reading clues from the environment that others can’t perceive. Tracking doesn’t work well, however, in heavily traveled urban environments.

In addition, you have the terrain stunt power.

**Terrain stunt:** At the start of each battle in a non-urban environment, roll a d6. Any time after the escalation die reaches that number, you’ll be able to use a quick action to execute a terrain stunt. Normally you can only use terrain stunt once per battle, but circumstances, geography, or excellent planning may suggest that you can pull it off more than once.

Terrain stunts are improvisational effects that play off your preternatural understanding of the wilderness and all the diverse forms of the natural world. Things like knocking a hornets nest no one had noticed onto your enemy’s head, maneuvering a foe onto a soggy patch of ground that slows them down, shooting the cap off a mushroom spore in a dungeon that erupts on your enemies, getting your enemy’s sword wedged into a stalactite, finding the tree branch that lets you vault up to attack the flying demon that thought it was out of axe range, and similar types of actions.

##### Adventurer Feat

Your grasp of the way the world is put together increases; you now can use terrain stunt in urban environments.

##### Champion Feat

You can track as well in urban areas as you do in the wilderness.

##### Epic Feat

You can track flying creatures and creatures that normally wouldn’t be trackable, and there’s the possibility that even teleports give you a sense of direction.

#### Two-Weapon Mastery

You gain a +1 attack bonus when fighting with a one-handed melee weapon in each hand.

##### Adventurer Feat

When you fight with two one-handed melee weapons, increase the damage you deal with missed attacks by adding your level to it. Most of your basic melee attacks, therefore, will deal double your level as miss damage.

##### Champion Feat

If you fight with two one-handed melee weapons, whenever an enemy makes a melee attack against you and rolls a natural 1, you can make an opportunity attack against that foe as a free action.

##### Epic Feat

One battle per day, increase the damage you deal with missed attacks to triple your level instead of double your level (from Two-Weapon Mastery).

### Animal Companion Rules

You have a devoted animal companion who fights alongside you like a member of your adventuring party.

If you have a single talent invested into Animal Companion, you are an Animal Companion initiate. If you invested two talents into Animal Companion, you are an Animal Companion adept.

These are the same rules as for the druid.

#### Calling to Battle

When you roll initiative, you may choose whether you want your animal companion to take part in the battle. You may also call your animal companion during the battle with a quick action.

Animal Companion initiates may only call their animal companion once every other battle. The animal companion may not fight in two battles in a row—even between full heal-ups, adventures, or gaining new levels. Animal Companion adepts don’t have this limitation; their animal companion can fight in every battle if the adept so chooses.

#### Recoveries

As an initiate, add a recovery to your total recoveries. As an adept, add two recoveries to your total recoveries. You can use a recovery on yourself or your animal companion.

#### Actions

Your animal companion acts on your initiative turn, either immediately before or after you, depending on the animal type.

Your animal companion moves gets a move action and a standard action, but not a quick action.

If you have powers that care about the “first time you attack an enemy,” an attack by your animal companion counts as your attack.

#### Animal Harm

Your animal companion can be healed like an ally. If it gets healed without you being healed, it uses one of your recoveries. When you use a recovery while next to your animal companion (including being engaged with the same enemy), your animal companion is also healed using a free recovery.

Instead of dying like a monster or NPC at 0 hp, your animal companion follows PC rules for falling unconscious at 0 hp and dying after four failed death saves or when its negative hit points equal half its normal hit points. If your animal companion dies, it’s gone for the battle, though you can call it (or another one) to fight in the next battle (as an adept) or the in the battle after that (as an initiate). That animal companion will be one level lower than an animal companion would normally be, i.e. two levels below you. At the start of the next battle, bump the animal companion up to its proper level, i.e. one below you.

#### Stats & Levels

Each animal companion has roughly the same base stats as listed below.

Your animal companion is always one level lower than you. As a 1st level ranger, you’ll have a level 0 animal companion. Once you gain a level, your animal companion rises to 1st level.

On top of the base stats, each type of animal has a zoologically appropriate power or advantage.

#### Companion Bonuses

Each type of animal companion is a little different.

##### Bear (also Giant Badger, Wolverine)

**Acts:** After ranger

**Advantage:** The bear gains temporary hit points equal to its level each time it hits with an attack.

##### Champion Feat

The temporary hit points increase to double its level.

##### Boar (also Spiky Lizard)

**Acts:** Before ranger

**Advantage:** The boar gains a +1 attack bonus when it moves before its attack during the same turn.

##### Eagle (also Falcon, Hawk, Owl, Vulture)

**Acts:** Before ranger

**Advantage:** It flies! Its melee damage die is dropped by one size (d6 at level 0).

##### Panther (also Lion, Tiger)

**Acts:** Before ranger

**Advantage:** The panther’s crit range expands by 2 against enemies with lower initiative.

##### Snake (also Giant Spider, Poison Toad)

**Acts:** After ranger

**Advantage:** The snake also deals ongoing poison damage equal to twice your level on a natural attack roll of 18+.

##### Champion Feat

The ongoing damage is three times your level instead.

##### Epic Feat

The ongoing damage is four times your level instead.

##### Wolf (also Big Dog, Coyote, Hyena, Jackal)

**Acts:** After ranger

**Advantage:** The wolf gains a +1 attack bonus against enemies its master attacked the same turn, or against enemies engaged with its master.

#### Baseline Stats

Use the following stats as the baseline for your animal companion. Remember that your companion stays a level lower than you. Generally your companion’s Physical Defense should be higher than its Mental Defense, but you could flip that if you have a good explanation.

| Level | Attack     | Damage | AC | PD (or MD) | MD (or PD) | HP        |
|-------|------------|--------|----|------------|------------|-----------|
| 0     | +5 vs. AC  | d8     | 16 | 14| 10| 20 (10)   |

| 9     | +17 vs. AC | `dice: 9d6`    | 27 | 25| 21| 180 (90)  |
| 10    | +18 vs. AC | `dice: 10d6`   | 28 | 26| 22| 216 (108) |

#### Animal Companion Feats

Ranger animal companion feats are designed so that they do not build on each other. Unlike other feats, you don’t have to take animal companion feats progressively, one after the other as long as you qualify for the correct tier.

##### Adventurer Feats

-   Once per day, your animal companion can attack twice in a round with a standard action.
-   Once per battle, your animal companion can turn a disengage success by an enemy it is engaged with into a failure.
-   Once per day, reroll one of your animal companion’s missed attack rolls.
-   Your animal companion adds the escalation die to its attacks.

##### Champion Feats

-   Once per day, your animal companion can force an enemy to reroll an attack that hit it.
-   Your Lethal Hunter talent also applies to your animal companion.
-   Increase your animal companion’s Physical Defense and Mental Defense by +1.

##### Epic Feats

-   Increase your animal companion’s damage die by one size (for example, from d6s to d8s, or d8s to d10s).
-   Increase your animal companion’s AC by +1.

#### Animal Companion Spells

As an Animal Companion adept, you gain a number of spells to help your animal companion—or another’s—fight better. You don’t have to choose the spells you know ahead of time. You can cast any spell of your level or lower, limited only by the number of daily spells you get. Once you cast a particular daily spell, no matter its level, you can’t cast it again until you take your next full heal-up.

Animal Companion spells are not available to Animal Companion initiates.

9th level spell: You now heal hit points equal to `dice: 2d10` + double your Wisdom modifier.

#### 9th Level Spells

##### Spirit Guardian

Ranged spell

Free action to cast

Daily

**Special Trigger:** You drop to 0 hp or below while your animal companion is nearby and still above 0 hp.

**Effect:** Your spirit trades places with the spirit of your animal companion. You now occupy the body of your animal companion, using its current hit points, defences, and attacks (and the effects of any spells cast upon it earlier).

You can’t cast spells or use your normal humanoid powers and class features while in your companion’s body. You can either keep fighting as your animal companion or you can roll a normal save as a quick action once during each of your turns; if you succeed, your body and your animal companion's body swap places while your spirits return to their proper bodies. You keep the hit points of the animal companion before you rolled the save, but can heal using a recovery when the swap is complete, if you wish. Returning to your own partially-healed body thanks to the successful save ends the spell's effect.

While your animal companion is in your body, it can roll death saves and be healed. If it becomes conscious it can attack using its basic melee attacks, but it doesn’t have access to any of your spells or powers. Any failed death saves remain with the spirit that failed them, not the body.
