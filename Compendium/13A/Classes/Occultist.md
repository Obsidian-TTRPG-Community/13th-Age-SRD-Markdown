## Occultist

There is only one occultist, and your one unique thing should account for your knowledge and mastery of powers hidden and occluded.

### Ability Scores

The occultist gains a +2 class bonus to Intelligence or Wisdom, as long as it isn’t the same ability you increase with your +2 racial bonus.

### Backgrounds

Possible backgrounds for the occultist’s singular knowledge include: librarian of the forbidden, or wandering mystic. Perhaps the occultist is a holy one whose secret knowledge comes from the heavens, or perhaps she has been touched by the abyss, and her secret knowledge comes from someplace far more sinister.

### Gear

At 1st level, the occultist starts with the embroidered robes, secret scrolls, and runic vestments that you would expect from someone with such arcane power. He might have a small item that looks like a harmless bauble but whose markings become more intricate and mesmerising the longer it’s viewed. To defend himself, he has a staff or a dagger hidden under his robe. He also has some personal possessions left over from his earlier life.

#### Gold Pieces

The occultist may start with either 25 gp or `dice: 1d6*10` gp.

#### Armor

### Class Features

#### Arcane Implements

You use arcane power to alter fate. While wands and staffs are designed for casting spells that are different from the spells you use, given a little time you can bend such an implement to your will.

##### Epic Feat

If you find a magic weapon that isn’t an arcane implement but that calls to your soul, you can bend it to your will and use its attack and damage bonus for spellcasting also. Any other arcane benefits you gain from the weapon are at the GM’s discretion.

#### Delayed Magical Healing

Magical healing effects heal you one round after the effect would normally be applied. You gain the healing at the start of the turn of whoever applied the magical healing effect, or at the start of your next turn if you drank a healing potion or found some other way of magically healing yourself during your last turn. This doesn’t apply outside of combat or when you rally.

##### Adventurer Feat

Your baseline hit points are 7 instead of 6.

##### Champion Feat

Once per battle when a healing effect would be applied to you, you can roll a save (11+). If you succeed, you get the healing immediately. If you fail, lose a hit point.

##### Epic Feat

Increase your total recoveries by 1. Once per day as a free action when a natural attack roll of 17 or less hits you, you take only half damage from that attack instead.

#### Focus and Spellcasting

Wielding your arcane power of reality requires two steps. First, you take time to focus your mind. Once you have this focus, you can cast a spell. Casting a spell generally expends your focus, though there will be exceptions depending on the spell.

Gaining your focus requires a standard action, and it draws opportunity attacks just like using a ranged attack does. (The “range” in this case is “beyond this world.”) You can cast most of your spells only in response to an event, typically during an enemy’s turn or an ally’s turn.

##### Adventurer Feat

When you cast a spell and retain your focus, you gain a +2 bonus to all defences until the start of your next turn.

##### Champion Feat

While you have your focus, when an enemy misses you with an attack, it takes psychic damage equal to your level.

##### Epic Feat

The “retain focus” range of your occultist spells increases by 2 (for example, 1–5 would be 1–7).

#### Rebuke

With focus, you can pummel someone with their own negative karma. In addition to the spells you normally know based on your level, you also know *karmic rebuke*. There are no feats associated with this spell, but you can improve it with the Superior Rebuke talent.

*Karmic rebuke* requires a quick action instead of an interrupt action. It’s designed so you can cast it during your turn when you’ve retained your focus, then use your standard action to get your focus back that same turn.

##### Karmic Rebuke

Close-quarters spell

**At-Will**

Quick action to cast; expend focus

**Target:** One nearby enemy

**Attack:** Intelligence + Level vs. MD

**Hit:** `dice: 1d6` + Wisdom psychic damage.

3rd level spell: `dice: 3d6` damage.

5th level spell: `dice: 5d6` damage.

7th level spell: `dice: 5d8`damage.

9th level spell: `dice: 7d10`damage.

#### Uniqueness

You’re the only occultist. Your one unique thing should address your identity as the occultist, but you need to contribute your own personal take on the character just like you would with a dwarf fighter or other character class. A character’s *unique* concerns story material beyond a class description, yours included.

#### Spell Choices and Flexible Recharge

Like a standard spellcaster, you choose the spells you will be able to cast after each full heal-up. When you successfully recharge a spell, you can regain any spell of that spell’s level, not necessarily the same spell again. In effect, you roll to recharge that level’s spell slot.

##### Adventurer Feat

Once per day, you can automatically succeed on a recharge roll that’s 6+ (but not 11+ or 16+).

##### Champion Feat

Once per day when you recharge a spell (usually during a quick rest), you can make a recharge roll for a recharge spell even if you haven’t expended that spell (allowing you to have an additional use of that spell available).

##### Epic Feat

Once per day, you can automatically succeed on a recharge roll.

### Class Talents

Choose four of the following class talents. You get an additional occultist class talent at 5th level, and again at 8th level.

#### Brain-Melting Secrets

When you hit with a spell attack that deals psychic damage, one target of the attack can’t attack you during its next turn this battle unless you are the only nearby enemy.

##### ***Adventurer Feat***

The effect works whenever you hit an enemy with a spell, not only one that deals psychic damage.

##### ***Champion Feat***

You are immune to the confused and dazed conditions. In addition, charm, fear, sleep, and similar mental effects have no effect on you.

##### ***Epic Feat***

Once per battle when you deal psychic damage to an enemy, if it has 300 hp or fewer, you can also weaken it (save ends).

#### Hewer of Truth

You can use an edged melee weapon without an attack penalty. You can use Intelligence instead of Strength for your attack rolls with that weapon, and Wisdom instead of Strength for your damage rolls. In addition, when you hit an enemy engaged with you with a spell, you can cause a small amount of extra harm to that foe with your weapon. The target takes ongoing damage equal to your melee attack miss damage.

##### ***Adventurer Feat***

Twice per day when an enemy engaged with you misses you with an attack, you can deal ongoing damage to it equal to your Wisdom modifier + Level as you give it a quick slice you’re your weapon (double your Wisdom modifier at 5th level; triple it at 8th level).

##### ***Champion Feat***

While you have your focus, you gain a +4 bonus to opportunity attacks.

##### ***Epic Feat***

Once per day when you hit an enemy with *karmic rebuke*, you can make a basic melee attack as a free action.

#### Icon Channeler

*You cannot take this talent if you have taken the* Icon Envoy *talent.*

You have three fewer relationship dice than normal (i.e. none at adventurer tier, one at champion tier, and two at epic tier). Instead, when all the characters get to roll relationship dice, you get a 5 to apply to any icon you choose. Like any other character, you can gain relationship dice through extraordinary story events. Remember, just because an icon is out to kill you doesn’t mean you have relationship dice with that icon. Dice represent the utility of a connection in the story not its strength. If you encounter icons other than the standard ones, you can probably talk the GM into letting you align your soul to them, but expect it to cost you.

##### ***Adventurer Feat***

Choose three icons when you take this feat. Each time you apply your 5 to one of those icons, roll a d6. On a 5–6, change that 5 you’re applying to a 6.

##### ***Champion Feat***

As the adventurer feat, except that you can also choose three more icons (six total) when you take this feat that allow you to roll the d6 when you apply a 5 to one of them.

##### ***Epic Feat***

You now get two 5s when the other characters roll icon relationship dice. You can roll a d6 for each 5 if you apply it to a chosen icon from the adventurer and champion feats.

#### Icon Envoy

*You cannot take this talent if you have taken the* Icon Channeler *talent.*

Each time the characters roll relationship dice, declare which player will get at least a 5 with one of their icons before the rolls. The player rolls one of their dice for that icon before the others. That first roll counts as a 5 unless the player rolls 6. Roll all other icon dice normally.

##### ***Adventurer Feat***

Once per level, instead of working with the icon relationships your ally has, give an ally a 5 with an icon they don’t have a relationship with.

##### ***Champion Feat***

If the first roll for the called icon is even (2, 4, 6), it counts as a 6 instead of a 5.

##### ***Epic Feat***

If the first roll for the called icon is odd (1, 3, 5), you can declare a second player and one of their icons, and have them roll one icon die the same way.

#### Otherworld Shadow

A shadow self haunts and lurks near you most of the time, sometimes an actual shadow on a wall, but other times only a presence sensed just over your shoulder. Once per day as an interrupt action, negate all damage and effects from an enemy’s attacks against you that turn as your shadow absorbs them. Using this talent’s power means you avoid damage from a monster’s multiple attacks if it has them. It also works against multiple attacks from mooks in the same mob working on the same initiative count, but not attacks from multiple non-mook monsters.

##### ***Adventurer Feat***

Your shadow grants you greater personal resilience: increase your total recoveries by 1.

##### ***Champion Feat***

Once per day as a free action, you can end all ongoing damage affecting you as you pass off the damage to your shadow.

##### ***Epic Feat***

Once per day as a free action, you gain a *fear aura* that affects each enemy attacking you or engaged with you. The hit point threshold for the fear effect is the standard value for a monster five levels above you. Allies are not subject to the fear effect unless they cast a spell that targets you or otherwise interact with you directly in some way. Even in this case, that ally can spend a move action to be immune to your shadow’s *fear aura* for one round.

| PC Level | Fear Threshold HP (Level + 5) |
|----------|-------------------------------|
| 1        | 30 |
| 2        | 36 |
| 3        | 48 |
| 4        | 60 |

| 8        | 144|
| 9        | 192|
| 10       | 230|
^13A-Class-Occultist-Fear-Aura

#### Stance of Necessity

Twice per day as a quick action, you can gain a +4 bonus to all defences. The protection lasts until the end of the battle and is in effect while you do NOT have your focus. The bonus also ends when an attack hits you while you don’t have your focus.

##### Adventurer Feat

You can guard a nearby ally instead of yourself (you don’t have to see that ally). The defense bonus ends if either you or the ally is hit while you don’t have your focus.

##### Champion Feat

Your Stance of Necessity uses are now recharge 16+ instead of daily.

##### Epic Feat

When an enemy misses you with an attack while you don’t have your focus, it takes psychic damage equal to triple your Wisdom modifier + Level.

#### Superior Rebuke

The first time each round that you expend your focus to cast a spell as an interrupt action and fail to retain your focus, roll a d20 afterward. On an 18–20, you can also cast *karmic rebuke* as a free action, using that roll in place of your attack roll. You can use this talent again during a later round in the battle once you have your focus again.

##### Adventurer Feat

You can also make the *karmic rebuke* attack when the d20 roll is 2–4 (low monster MD plus an escalation die bonus often means you’ll still hit).

##### Champion Feat

You can also make a *karmic rebuke* attack as a free action when you roll a natural 5, 10, 15, or 20 on initiative, even if you don’t have your focus.

##### Epic Feat

One battle per day as a free action, you can enhance your *karmic* *rebuke*. When you enhance it, enemies are vulnerable (crit range expands by 2) to your *karmic rebuke* attacks until the end of the battle or until you score a critical hit with the attack.

#### Unwinding the Soul

When you cast a spell and roll a natural 11+ with the attack, after the attack you can “unwind” the target as a free action, making it vulnerable to your attacks until the end of the battle. You can unwind only one enemy at a time, so if you choose to unwind a different enemy, the previous foe is no longer vulnerable to your attacks.

##### Adventurer Feat

You can now unwind a second enemy, but if you unwind a third, the first enemy is no longer vulnerable. You can also take this feat multiple times, allowing you to unwind another enemy each time you select it.

##### Champion Feat

You can now unwind an enemy with any attack roll other than a natural 1 when you cast a spell, instead of only on an 11+.

##### Epic Feat

When you attack an enemy that you have begun to unwind and roll a natural 11+ against it, it takes extra psychic damage equal to your Wisdom modifier + Level from all subsequent hits by you or your allies.

#### Warp Flesh

When you cast a spell that targets Mental Defense and the target has a higher MD than PD, the attack “twists” and targets PD instead. When a spell twists this way, it deals force damage instead of its normal damage type.

##### Adventurer Feat

When you cast a spell that twists, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier (double your Wisdom modifier at 5th level; triple it at 8th level).

##### Champion Feat

When you score a critical hit with a spell, the target also takes ongoing force damage equal to double your Wisdom modifier (triple it at 8th level). The ongoing damage isn’t doubled by the crit.

##### Epic Feat

Once per battle when you hit an enemy with a spell, you can negate all of the target’s resistances (hard save ends, 16+). This effect occurs even if the target’s PD is higher than its MD.

**Effect:** Before the target drops, it can make a basic attack against the attacking enemy as a free action (if possible), but uses your attack roll instead.

If the target can’t make a basic attack against the enemy making the triggering attack, this spell has no effect.

**Retain Focus:** 1–5.

5th level spell: Prevent `dice: 5d6` damage.

7th level spell: Prevent `dice: 5d8`damage.

9th level spell: Prevent `dice: 7d10`damage.

**Effect:** Reality goes back two minutes. You remember what happened the first time. No one else does.

##### Epic Feat

Take it back five minutes.
