## Druid

### Ability Scores

Druids gain a +2 class bonus to Strength, Dexterity, or Wisdom, as long as it isn’t the same ability you increase with your +2 racial bonus.

### Backgrounds

Possible backgrounds include: orc-tribe hunter/gatherer, avalanche prophet, cult zealot, river guide, tribe healer, failed shaman, wild temple priest, mystic waterfall guardian, and raised by wolverines.

### Gear

At 1st level, druids start with a melee weapon, light armor, possibly a staff, perhaps a bow or other ranged weapon, and other minor possessions suggested by their backgrounds.

#### Gold Pieces

Druids may start with either 25 gp or `dice: 1d6*10` gp.

### Class Features

Druids use divine implements, such as symbols and staffs, to improve their spellcasting. They can choose up to three talents to have many useful aptitudes, or they can specialize by putting two points into one talent (and the other into another talent). A druid who chooses three separate talents is an *initiate* in each one. Investing two points into a single talent allows the druid to become *adept* in that talent, thereby gaining more power at the expense of options, and an *initiate* in another talent.

As a druid, you choose whether you want to use Strength or Dexterity as the ability score you will use to determine attack and damage for your basic attacks. Choosing Strength as your melee attack ability score provides one significant benefit: your recovery dice become d10s instead of the d6s used by other druids. Choosing Dexterity as your melee attack ability score works well because Dexterity already boosts your initiative and ranged weapon attacks and might help your AC.

You never suffer from natural weather-related cold, heat, or exposure. You can go longer than most people without eating or drinking, but only a couple days longer.

You can also talk to plants and animals. If there is useful information to gain, roll a skill check that’s appropriate for the tier. Talking to animals requires a hard DC, and plants usually require a ridiculously hard DC. A druid gains a +1 bonus when talking with animals for every talent spent on the Shifter or Animal Companion talents. A druid gains a +1 bonus when talking with plants for every talent spent on the Terrain Caster talent.

#### Adventurer Feat

You can talk with plants and animals pretty much as often you like, and you gain a +5 bonus to any skill checks involved.

### Druid Talents

Each of your talents unlocks pools of spells and powers that are not available to characters who lack the talent. Druids who choose to be an adept with a talent gain additional benefits and powers in that talent.

***Animal Companion:*** As an initiate talent, it’s based on the ranger’s Animal Companion talent, but it’s only useful in half your battles instead of all the time. If you choose to be an Animal Companion adept, your animal companion will be with you every battle and you also learn spells that make your animal companion more effective.

***Elemental Caster:*** This talent is one of the druid’s two main spellcasting options. As an initiate talent, it grants access to a wide range of daily spells associated with air, earth, fire, and water. Becoming an Elemental Caster adept increases the number of spells you know and provides greater access to summoned elementals. As either an initiate or an adept, you can use adventurer-tier elemental mastery feats to gain at-will spell attacks.

***Shifter:*** This talent enables you to shift your form in two ways: scout form transformations into quick-moving animals for out of combat reconnaissance, and beast form transformations into combat-ready predators. Adepts gain more benefits while fighting in beast form.

***Terrain Caster:*** This talent is the druid’s other major spellcasting option. As an initiate, you gain access to daily spells that you can only cast in one of the eight specific types of terrain. Adepts get twice as many daily spells. Feats provide at-will spell attacks that can be used regardless of what terrain you are in.

***Warrior Druid:*** This talent lets a druid use once-per-battle flexible attacks that enable them to fight as a serious melee combatant in humanoid form. Generally, this talent makes druids into weapon and shield users, but the talent can integrate with the Shifter talent while a druid fights in beast form.

***Wild Healer:*** As an initiate talent, it gives you access to *regeneration* spells and eventually a *wild heal* spell. Adepts get enough *regeneration* spells, *wild heal* spells, and *greater regeneration* spells to be a primary healer in any adventuring group.

#### Animal Companion

You have a normal-sized animal companion that fights alongside you in battle. See Animal Companion Rules.

#### Elemental Caster

As an elemental caster, you can summon elementals and draw on the raw magic of nature, providing many powerful daily spells. Like a wizard or cleric, you choose the Elemental Caster spells you will be able to cast after each full heal-up.

You can choose as many feats as you wish from feat trees related to mastering the four elements: air, earth, fire and water. The adventurer-tier feats for the elemental masteries provide access to at-will attack spells. You cast these at-will spells at your current level or one level below (when you’re at even levels).

Elemental caster initiates can cast fewer daily spells than adepts. Adepts are also able to use two different *summon elemental* spells each day, to the initiate’s one.

The 3rd level Elemental Caster spells are the four elemental summoning spells: *summon air elemental*, *summon earth elemental*, *summon fire elemental*, and *summon water elemental*. Each summoning spell summons an elemental of the same level as the spell.

Summoned elementals start battles with half the hit points of standard elementals.

Each elemental that’s at least 5th level has a transformation ability that greatly improves its effectiveness in battle. Free elementals transform the first time they succeed with their transformation rolls, but summoned elementals have to succeed with their transformation rolls *twice* before their transformation takes effect.

Initiates can choose only one *summon elemental* spell each day, while adepts can choose up to two.

(See Summoning Rules for the basic summoning rules.)

These feats apply to the following summoning spells.

###### Adventurer Feat

Your summoned creatures can arrive anywhere you can see nearby, instead of needing to appear beside you.

###### Champion Feat

When you summon a non-mook creature, roll `dice: 2d10` and add double your Strength modifier or Dexterity modifier, whichever is higher. Your summoned creature increases its base hit points by that amount. (At 8th level, roll `dice: 3d10`and add triple the modifier.)

Once per day when you heal using a recovery, a creature you summoned can heal the same amount, ignoring the usual restrictions on limited healing for summoned creatures.

##### 9th Level Spells

###### Wall of Stone (Earth)

Ranged spell

Daily

**Effect:** You create a more or less impenetrable wall of stone that’s pretty big. You can’t drop it on top of enemies or bend it after creating it, but it can form natural flowing shapes like a river of stone that’s at most 40 feet high, 120 feet long, and 10 feet thick. If you’re straining to come up with nasty ways to use the wall, you’re breaking the spirit of the spell, since it’s just supposed to be a stone wall that blocks most other creatures’ movements.

You, the spellcasting druid, can move through the wall at will, but you can’t end your turn inside it.

The wall isn’t permanent: walls of stone generally disappear at sunrise or sunset.

##### Summoning Rules

These general rules also apply to the necromancer’s Summoning class feature.

###### Standard Action Spells

Casting a summoning spell generally requires a standard action. The creature(s) you summon appears next to you, though feats or powers might enable you to summon it nearby instead.

###### Duration

A summoned creature fights for you until the end of the battle or until it drops to 0 hit points. At 0 hp, summoned creatures are slain and removed from the battle.

###### One Summoning Spell at a time

Each spellcaster can have only a single summoning spell active at a time. If all the creatures from an earlier summoning spell have been slain, you’re free to cast another. Alternatively, you can dismiss your own previously summoned creatures as a quick action to clear the way for a new summoning spell.

###### Halfway there

Summoned creatures are not the same as real creatures. They’re partly real, partly magical. Their abilities don’t always match the capabilities of the creatures that the adventurers encounter *for real*. Sometimes this is reflected in a summoned creature’s attacks or abilities. It’s always reflected in a summoned creature’s hit points.

###### Hit Points

Each summoned creature stat block indicates its base hit points. Starting hit points for summoned creatures are nearly always lower than hit points for non-summoned versions of the same creature. Some class feats might increase the hit points of summoned creatures.

###### Actions on Arrival

The turn you summon a creature, that creature takes its turn immediately after your turn in initiative order. During its turn, the summoned creature can act like any other creature, taking a standard, move, and quick action. The summoned creature continues to take its turn immediately after you (even if your initiative order changes) until the end of the battle.

###### Escalation Die

As a rule, summoned creatures don’t benefit from the escalation die. A summoned creature can add the escalation die to attacks, however, if *you use a quick action* to give it orders or magical reinforcement. The summoned creature then gets to use the escalation die until the start of your next turn, including for opportunity attacks and other attacks that it gets to make during other creatures’ turns.

For example, during the turn you summon the creature, you use a quick action afterward to give it orders, allowing it to use the escalation die bonus. At the start of your next turn, the creature no longer gets to use the escalation die, so you’ll have to use another quick action again during that turn for the creature to keep getting the benefit.

If you’ve summoned a mob of mooks, a single quick action lets every member of the mob use the escalation die.

###### Allies

Summoned creatures generally count as your allies (for roleplaying as well as for resolving effects).

###### No Recoveries, Bad Healing

Summoned creatures don’t have recoveries. If you cast a healing spell on a summoned creature that requires the use of a recovery, the summoned creature heals hit points equal to your level. If you use an effect that would heal a summoned creature without using a recovery, the summoned creature only heals half the normal hit points of the effect. Temporary hit points still work normally.

###### No Nastier Specials

Creatures you summon don’t use nastier specials.

###### Spell or Creature

When a summoning spell is cast, it’s definitely a spell. After casting the spell, a summoned creature is a creature.

#### Shifter

You glory in shifting into the forms of animals that nature blessed with keen eyes, swift wings, and terrible fangs. You also gain a number of aspects that you can assume while battling in beast form to improve your capabilities.

##### Scout Form

Scout forms are magical versions of normal, smaller animals that are useful for scouting, such as bobcats, coyotes, owls, lizards, dire rats, giant spiders, and so on. In scout form, you shouldn’t have any problem slipping through the world without being troubled by any but the most serious defences. However, you don’t look like a natural animal; there’s something extremely magical about you.

Becoming a small animal isn’t a perfect translation of self. Your humanoid brain doesn’t work the same when you’ve shifted into scout form. You don’t talk. You can’t cast spells. Your magical items and possessions change shape with you, but you don’t get to use them in scout form. You maintain your identity and know who your allies are, but you’re as much an animal as a person while in the form.

###### Fighting in Scout Form

Fighting in scout form should be avoided unless you’re fighting a mundane animal. If you do attempt to fight, your attacker hits you unless he rolls a natural 1, and taking damage this way transforms you back into humanoid form.

###### Shifting Into Scout Form and Back

Transforming from humanoid or beast form into scout form requires a standard action. To transform back to human form from scout form requires a quick action. A Shifter adept can transform directly from scout to beast form (as a quick action), but a Shifter initiate must transform to human form first. You can only shift once per round. You can stay in scout form as long as you like, or switch back to humanoid form and then back again the next round.

###### Using Scout Form Shifts

Shifting into scout form is a daily, but you can do it at will. You can shift for roleplaying reasons, or for combat reconnaissance. To gain an advantage for an upcoming battle (or one just about to start), using your scout form requires a skill check.

Before rolling initiative, you expend one daily scout form use and roll a skill check to see how successful you were with your combat recon. Depending on the terrain, the weather, and the particular enemies or dangers, the GM will ask you to use an ability score that makes sense for the situation just like any other check, though Wisdom, Dexterity, and Strength are often common choices.

You’ll normally roll against the standard difficulty of the current environment. While in scout form in an adventurer-tier area, the normal check starts at DC 15, a hard check is DC 20, and a ridiculously hard check is DC 25. Champion tier increases the DC by 5, and epic tier by 5 more. Note that a successful check that qualifies for a higher DC gains you the information/advantage for that result, plus any lower results. A normal success or better probably negates any chance of an ambush or surprise by the enemy you’ve scouted.

**Failure:** Nothing came of your scouting.

**Normal success:** You gain a +4 bonus to initiative this battle.

**Hard success:** As a free action at some point during the battle, you can grant one of your allies a reroll on an attack roll or save. That ally must take the new result. You must explain how something that happened while you were scouting contributed to this benefit.

**Ridiculously hard success:** The GM chooses between giving *you* a reroll at some point during the battle, or giving you a floating story-guide icon relationship result of 6 with a random icon.

You only need to take one of the two adventurer-tier feats to access the champion-tier feat. You can also take both adventurer-tier feats, if you wish.

*Adventurer Feat*

Your temporary animal background roll is a `dice: 1d6` instead of `dice: 1d4` + 1, and count a 1 rolled as a 2.

*Adventurer Feat*

A normal success with your combat recon skill check also grants your allies a +2 bonus to initiative this battle.

*Champion Feat*

Rerolls from your combat recon exploits gain a +2 bonus.

*Epic Feat*

You now get two benefits instead of one when you succeed at a ridiculously hard skill check with your scout form.

##### Beast Form

Shifter initiates have a certain number of uses of beast form each day, allowing them to fight one or more battles in the shape of powerful predators. Since beast form transformations are like other daily powers, lasting no more than five minutes, Shifter initiates seldom stay in beast form, instead moving around in humanoid form or scout form.

Shifter adepts can use beast form at-will.

###### Beast Form

Daily for Shifter initiates (1 or 2 uses)

At-Will for Shifter adepts

Quick action

**Effect:** You leave your humanoid form behind and assume the form of a deadly predator such as a wolf, panther, tiger, bear, wolverine, lion, or another animal that you are naturally connected to.

The choice of what type of animal you become is up to you. You don’t always have to change into the same thing—your choices can suit the story. Stick to four-legged natural predators, not creatures with supernatural abilities or the ability to fly.

Shifter adepts can speak in growly voices and cast spells while in beast form. Shifter initiates can speak in beast form but can’t cast spells unless they take the champion-tier feat below.

***Magic items:*** Your magic items stick with you and you get the benefit of their default bonuses. Yes, this means the bonuses from your magic axe translate to your beast form. Shifter adepts can use their magic item powers while in beast form. Shifter initiates can’t, but see the champion-tier feat below.

***Beast form actions:*** Shifter adepts can shift freely between humanoid form and beast form during a battle. Shifter initiates who shift into beast form use up one of their daily beast form shifts, but they can shift between beast form and humanoid form without using a daily shift for the rest of that battle.

For both adepts and initiates, shifting to humanoid form during your turn is a quick action. So is shifting back to beast form.

***Beast aspects:*** While in beast form, you can take on aspects of different beasts to help you in battle (see below). You don’t have to use the aspects; they’re an option to improve your beast form attacks and powers, not a requirement.

While in beast form, you attack in melee using a *beast form attack*.

###### Beast Form Attack

Melee attack

At-Will

**Attack:** Strength or Dexterity + Level vs. AC

**Natural Even Hit:** `dice: 1d10`damage per level + Strength or Dexterity damage.

**Natural Odd Hit:** `dice: 1d6` damage per level + Strength or Dexterity damage.

**Miss:** Repeat the attack against the same or a different target. This second attack has no *miss* effect.

*Adventurer Feat*

For both initiates and adepts, your second beast form attack (the one you roll when the first attack misses) now deals miss damage equal to your level. If you are a Shifter adept, you can have two beast aspects active at the same time. If you start using a third aspect, one of the two previous aspects of your choice ends.

*Champion Feat*

If you are a Shifter initiate, you can now cast spells and use magic item powers while in beast form. If you are a Shifter adept, you can have three beast aspects active at the same time. If you start using a fourth aspect, one of the two previous aspects of your choice ends.

*Epic Feat*

If you are a Shifter adept, your beast form can now be a lycanthropic form when you wish—furred, deadly, and possessing a new power that you can use only while in lycanthropic form: *shake it off*.

*Shake It Off*

**Special:** You gain access to this power by taking the epic feat for *beast form attack*. To use it, you must be using at least one beast aspect.

**Recharge** 16+ after battle

Free action

**Trigger:** You take damage while fighting in beast form

**Effect:** You end a beast aspect power that you are using and then take only `dice: 6d6`damage from the triggering attack and ignore the rest of the damage. You still suffer any other effects of the attack (including ongoing damage).

###### Beast Aspect

Beast aspects are powers you can use while in beast form to help you in battle. You must choose the aspects you know at each full heal-up. You can select any of the following aspects beginning at 1st level.

Normally you can use only one beast aspect at a time and using another aspect ends the previous one. The *beast form attack* feats change that for the Shifter adept.

***Beast aspect bonuses*****:** Many beast aspects provide bonuses to defences or attacks. Shifter adepts can combine bonuses to the same stats from two aspects they are using simultaneously, an exception to the general rule that bonuses don’t stack. For example, a Shifter adept using *bear aspect* with its champion feat would have a +2 AC, and if the adept was also using *behemoth aspect* with its champion feat, the total defensive bonuses for the adept would be +5 AC and +3 PD.

***Effects:*** Beast aspects only affect you while you are in beast form, which means that every aspect should be understood to read “while in beast form” for all its effects and powers.

Shifting out of beast form to humanoid form prevents a beast aspect from having any effect, but it doesn’t end the aspect. When you shift back to beast form, the aspect is in effect again. Aspects last until the end of the battle.

***Appearances:*** The names of the aspects are a guide to what you might look like when channeling that beast, but it’s also possible to decide that your usual beast form is, for example, wolf-like, and that using bear aspect or behemoth aspect merely adds bear-like or behemoth-like qualities to your standard wolf-shape.

*Bear Aspect*

Beast aspect

Daily, or recharge 16+ for adepts

Quick action

**Initiate Effect:** Until the end of the battle, while in beast form you gain a +2 bonus to attacks and damage against lower level enemies and mooks of any level (damage bonus increases to 2 + double your Strength or Dexterity modifier at 5th level; damage bonus increases to 2 + triple your Strength or Dexterity modifier at 8th level).

**Adept Effect:** As the initiate effect, and when you first shift into this aspect, roll your recovery dice as if you were healing, but you instead gain that many temporary hit points. You don’t spend a recovery.

Adventurer Feat

The initiate effect’s attack bonus is now +4 instead of +2.

Champion Feat

Adepts also gain a +2 AC bonus while using this aspect.

Epic Feat

Until the first time it recharges each day, *bear aspect* is recharge 11+ instead of recharge 16+ for adepts.

*Behemoth Aspect*

Beast aspect

Daily, or recharge 16+ for adepts

Quick action

**Initiate Effect:** You gain a +2 bonus to AC and PD.

**Adept Effect:** As the initiate effect, and the first time you become staggered this battle, roll a hard save (16+). If you fail, choose one of the two following benefits. If you succeed, you get both.

*Endurance:* You can heal using a recovery.

*Wrath:* Begin rolling 2d20 for each of your melee attacks and choose the result you prefer until the end of the battle or until you make both rolls for a melee attack and each roll is a natural 10 or less.

Adventurer Feat

The recovery from the adept’s *endurance* effect is now free.

Champion Feat

For adepts, the bonus to AC and PD is now +3 instead of +2.

Epic Feat

The save that determines the adept’s benefit(s) is now a normal save.

*Mantis Aspect*

Beast aspect

Daily, or recharge 16+ for adepts

Quick action

**Initiate Effect:** Until the end of the battle, when an enemy engaged with you fails a disengage check, you can make an opportunity attack against it. In addition, your natural even beast form attack rolls that would normally deal damage equal to your level deal half damage instead.

**Adept Effect:** As the initiate effect, and you gain a +`dice: 1d3` bonus to AC and a +`dice: 1d3` bonus to PD (two separate rolls). Insects are unpredictable.

Adventurer Feat

When an enemy attempts to disengage from you while you are using this aspect, it takes a penalty to the check equal to your Strength or Dexterity modifier.

Champion Feat

Adept effect bonuses are now d4s instead of d3s.

Epic Feat

Until the first time it recharges each day, *mantis aspect* is recharge 11+ instead of recharge 16+ for adepts.

*Leopard Aspect*

Beast aspect

Daily, or recharge 16+ for adepts

Quick action

**Initiate Effect:** Until the end of the battle, when an enemy misses you with a melee attack and rolls a natural 1–4, you gain an additional standard action during your next turn. You can only gain one additional standard action a turn this way. Powers like *elven grace* or a command won’t stack with this effect either.

**Adept Effect:** As the initiate effect, and you gain a +2 bonus to AC. You also gain a +5 bonus to disengage checks and to saves against being stuck, dazed, or stunned.

*Owlbear Aspect*

Beast aspect

Daily, or recharge 16+ for adepts

Quick action

**Initiate Effect:** Until the end of the battle, your crit range with melee attacks expands by 2.

**Adept Effect:** As the initiate effect, and you gain a +1 bonus to melee attacks and a +2 bonus to AC and PD.

Adventurer Feat

When you score a critical hit, you heal hit points equal to your level + your Wisdom modifier (double your Wisdom modifier at 5th level; triple it at 8th level).

Champion Feat

While you are in this aspect, your critical hits with melee attacks deal triple damage instead of double damage.

Epic Feat

Until the first time it recharges each day, *owlbear aspect* is recharge 11+ instead of recharge 16+ for adepts.

*Tiger Aspect*

Beast aspect

Daily, or recharge 16+ for adepts

Quick action

**Initiate Effect:** Until the end of the battle, you gain the benefits of two-weapon fighting: if your attack roll is a natural 2, you can reroll the attack, but must use the reroll. In addition, the crit range of attacks you reroll this way expands by 4.

**Adept Effect:** As the initiate effect, and increase the size of your beast form melee attack damage dice by one size (for example, d6s become d8s, and d10s become 12s).

Adventurer Feat

You also gain a +2 attack bonus with any attack you reroll while using this aspect.

Champion Feat

When you move and then attack an enemy you were not engaged with at the start of your turn, you can reroll your first natural odd attack roll each turn, but must use the reroll. (The initiate effect bonuses don’t apply to this reroll.)

Epic Feat

Until the first time it recharges each day, *tiger aspect* is recharge 11+ instead of recharge 16+ for adepts.

*Wolverine Aspect*

Beast aspect

Daily, or recharge 16+ for adepts

Quick action

**Initiate Effect:** Until the end of the battle, when your melee attacks hit an enemy that has more hit points than you, the target takes `dice: 1d6` extra damage from the hit.

**Adept Effect:** As the initiate effect, and you gain a +2 bonus to all defences. You can also rally once this battle as a quick action instead of a standard action.

Adventurer Feat

Your extra melee damage while using this aspect increases according to your level:

2nd level druid: +1d8 damage.

4th level druid: +1d10 damage.

6th level druid: +`dice:2d6` damage.

8th level druid: +`dice: 3d6` damage.

10th level druid: +`dice: 3d12` damage.

Champion Feat

You can use the damage bonus against an enemy that started the battle with more hit points than you, but no longer does.

Epic Feat

Until the first time it recharges each day, *wolverine aspect* is recharge 11+ instead of recharge 16+ for adepts.

#### Terrain Caster

There are eight different ranges of terrain that are relevant to druidic magic:

1.  cave, dungeon, underworld
    
2.  forest, woods
    
3.  ice, snowfields, tundra
    
4.  migration route (large herd animal)
    
5.  mountains
    
6.  plains, overworld
    
7.  ruins
    
8.  swamp, lake, river
    

At-will or once-per-battle spells provided by terrain caster adventurer feats can be cast in any terrain you like. Daily spells must match the type of terrain you’re in, though you don’t have to memorize them like a wizard, and the spell level you cast them at is your current character level.

Terrains need not be exclusive; ruins can exist on mountains, and the terrain caster can draw upon each. Any ambiguity should be decided by the GM.

##### Cave, Dungeon, Underworld

###### Adventurer Feat

###### Ways of the Dark (Terrain Feat Spell)

At-Will (in any terrain)

Ranged spell

**Target:** One nearby enemy

**Attack:** Wisdom + Level vs. MD

**Hit:** `dice: 1d8` psychic damage (don’t add your ability score modifier).

**Natural Even Hit:** As a hit, plus the target can’t attack the druid until the end of its next turn unless the druid moves to engage the target.

**Miss:** Damage equal to your level.

3rd level spell: `dice: 2d8` damage.

5th level spell: `dice: 3d8`damage.

7th level spell: `dice: 5d8`damage.

###### Spider Climb (1st level)

Ranged spell

Daily

Quick action to cast

**Target:** You

**Effect:** Until the end of the battle or for five minutes, you can climb up sheer surfaces and stick to ceilings as if you were a spider. You can fight and cast spells normally while climbing.

3rd level spell: If you’re fighting while standing upside down on a ceiling or sideways on a wall, you can reroll the first natural odd attack roll you get if you tell a fun story about how the *spider climb* effect is letting you fight better than you ordinarily would!

5th level spell: While the spell is in effect, you can fall up to 100 feet without taking damage.

7th level spell: The effect lasts up to an hour and you can also target a nearby ally.

9th level spell: The spell now targets you and `dice: 1d4` + 1 nearby allies.

9th level spell: 90 ongoing damage on a hit, 40 ongoing damage on a miss.

###### Spikestones (5th level)

Ranged spell

Daily

**Effect:** Until the end of the battle, the area the battle is occurring in is dangerous to move in. When an enemy moves through the area on the ground (enemies using *teleport* or similar powers aren’t affected), it must roll a normal save that turn. On a failure, that creature takes `dice: 7d6` damage. If they move again that turn, they don’t have to roll a save.

You can move normally in the area. Your allies must roll an easy save (6+); if they fail they take half damage when they move.

Since the spell normally only works underground, it affects creatures with *flight* because it’s assumed that nasty stalactites jut out from the ceiling as well as the walls and floors. If you’re in a *giant* cavern when you cast it, fliers could probably zip around away from surfaces without too much trouble (GM’s call).

7th level spell: `dice: 7d10`damage.

9th level spell: `dice: 9d10`damage.

##### Forest, Woods

###### Adventurer Feat

**Effect:** Until the end of the turn, you can teleport once as a move action by moving into a tree or other large plant and emerging from another plant or tree of the same species you can see or out of your line of sight. If you go beyond your line of sight, the GM chooses how far you can go, up to a mile.

Once per level when you cast this spell, you also summon a 5th level earth elemental beside one of the trees or plants involved in your teleport. Use the elemental caster’s *summon earth elemental* spell.

7th level spell: The once per level summoning now summons a 7th level earth elemental.

9th level spell: You can now use the spell to teleport virtually unlimited distances as long as you travel to a grove or forest and emerge from a tree or plant well-known to you. The once per level summoning now summons a 9th level earth elemental.

##### Ice, Tundra, Deep Snow

###### Adventurer Feat

You gain the *frost touch* spell below.

When you teleport, roll a d20. If you roll a 1, something unusual intervened and you arrive at a different herd site than you had intended (GM’s choice). Otherwise, you and your allies arrive somewhere hear the desired herd. Unlike the wizard’s 9th level *teleport* spell, this spell doesn’t allow you to choose your precise destination.

Any effects of spells or items cast/created before teleporting are canceled and no longer function on arrival, so it’s best to wait and use such spells after you arrive.

9th level spell: You can now try to teleport to any location along the migration route. Stabbing your finger on the world map suffices, but your aim won’t be perfect. Attempts to teleport to places off the map to the north or west usually don’t work.

Quick action to cast

**Effect:** During your next turn, you can cast a 3rd level daily Air or Fire spell from the Elemental Caster’s spell list even if you don’t ordinarily know that spell. The only limitation is that the spell can’t be a *summon elemental* spell. Casting that spell neither counts against your daily Elemental Caster spell limit if you have that talent, nor does it count against your daily Terrain Caster spell limit.

If something prevents you from casting the spell during your next turn, you still expend this daily spell.

#### Warrior Druid

Choose this talent if you want to fight well in melee with your normal weapons and armor.

Spending a single talent on Warrior Druid lets you choose *one* of the three following benefits:

-   Your AC in light armor is 12 instead of 10 like most other druids.
    
-   You don’t take opportunity attacks from enemies engaged with you when you cast ranged druid spells.
    
-   Your base hit points are 7 + CON mod instead of 6 + CON mod.
    

If you use two talents to become a Warrior Druid adept, choose *three* of the following benefits:

-   Your AC in light armor is 12 instead of 10 like most other druids.
    
-   You don’t take opportunity attacks from enemies engaged with you when you cast ranged druid spells.
    
-   Your base hit points are 7 + CON mod instead of 6 + CON mod.
    
-   You can use one-handed `dice: 1d8` martial weapons without taking the –2 attack penalty that other druids suffer.
    
-   You can use a shield (in human form) without taking an attack penalty like other druids.
    

Like the fighter class, you gain access to flexible attacks when you make basic melee attacks during your turn. Roll your attack, then choose one of the flexible attacks you know that can be triggered by your natural attack roll. Unlike the fighter, you can usually use each of your flexible attacks only once per battle.

If you’re also a Shifter initiate, you can use your Warrior Druid flexible attacks while in beast form, *but only* with your first beast form attack roll each turn. Adepts can use them freely.

##### Adventurer Feat

Choose another Warrior Druid benefit you weren’t able to start with. Whether you’re an initiate or an adept, you can take this feat twice to gain the two Warrior Druid benefits you are missing.

##### Regeneration

Close-quarters spell

**Special:** See level progression chart for usage per battle/day.

Interrupt action or quick action

**Target:** One nearby ally (with an interrupt action); or you (with a quick action)

**Trigger (for targeted ally):** One of your allies starts its turn

**Effect:** The target heals using a recovery, rolling recovery dice as normal, but heals only half (rounding down) the amount of healing rolled.

At the start of the target’s *next* turn, the target heals using a free recovery, but heals only half (rounding down) the amount rolled—the first recovery spent continues to fuel the *regeneration* effect. After the target heals this second time, it rolls a normal save to see if the *regeneration* spell will continue.

If the save fails, the *regeneration* spell ends.

If the save succeeds, the *regeneration* spell continues and the target will heal using a free recovery for half hit points again at the start of its next turn, and then roll another save to see if the *regeneration* continues, and so on.

*Special:* The save to continue the *regeneration* effect becomes a hard save (16+) if the target is at maximum hit points or if the target has dropped to 0 hit points or below while the *regeneration* is in effect.

**Special:** You can only have one *regeneration* or *greater regeneration* spell on you at a time. A second spell cast on you cancels the first.

##### Greater Regeneration

Close-quarters spell

**Special:** See level progression chart for usage per battle/day.

Interrupt action or quick action

**Target:** One nearby ally (with an interrupt action); or you (with a quick action)

**Trigger (for targeted ally):** One of your allies starts its turn

**Effect:** The target heals using two recoveries but only rolls recovery dice as if it had used a single recovery.

At the start of the target’s *next* turn, the target heals using a free recovery—the two recoveries spent continue to fuel the *greater* *regeneration* effect. After the target heals this second time, it rolls a normal save to see if the *greater regeneration* spell will continue.

If the save fails, the *greater regeneration* spell ends.

If the save succeeds, the *greater regeneration* spell continues and the target will heal using a free recovery again at the start of its next turn, and then roll another save to see if the *regeneration* continues, and so on.

*Special:* The save to continue the *regeneration* effect becomes a hard save (16+) if the target is at maximum hit points or if the target has dropped to 0 hit points or below while the *greater* *regeneration* is in effect.

**Special:** You can only have one *regeneration* or *greater regeneration* spell on you at a time. A second spell cast on you cancels the first.

##### Wild Heal

Close-quarters spell

Daily, see level progression chart for number of uses

Quick action

**Target:** You or one nearby ally, and one randomly chosen nearby ally that has taken damage

**Effect:** Each target heals using one of its recoveries.

### Animal Companion Rules

You have a devoted animal companion who fights alongside you like a member of your adventuring party.

If you have a single talent invested into Animal Companion, you are an Animal Companion initiate. If you invested two talents into Animal Companion, you are an Animal Companion adept.

These are the same rules as for the ranger.

#### Calling to Battle

When you roll initiative, you may choose whether you want your animal companion to take part in the battle. You may also call your animal companion during the battle with a quick action.

Animal Companion initiates may only call their animal companion once every other battle. The animal companion may not fight in two battles in a row—even between full heal-ups, adventures, or gaining new levels. Animal Companion adepts don’t have this limitation; their animal companion can fight in every battle if the adept so chooses.

#### Recoveries

As an initiate, add a recovery to your total recoveries. As an adept, add two recoveries to your total recoveries. You can use a recovery on yourself or your animal companion.

#### Actions

Your animal companion acts on your initiative turn, either immediately before or after you, depending on the animal type.

Your animal companion moves gets a move action and a standard action, but not a quick action.

If you have powers that care about the “first time you attack an enemy,” an attack by your animal companion counts as your attack.

#### Animal Harm

Your animal companion can be healed like an ally. If it gets healed without you being healed, it uses one of your recoveries. When you use a recovery while next to your animal companion (including being engaged with the same enemy), your animal companion is also healed using a free recovery.

Instead of dying like a monster or NPC at 0 hp, your animal companion follows PC rules for falling unconscious at 0 hp and dying after four failed death saves or when its negative hit points equal half its normal hit points. If your animal companion dies, it’s gone for the battle, though you can call it (or another one) to fight in the next battle (as an adept) or the in the battle after that (as an initiate). That animal companion will be one level lower than an animal companion would normally be, i.e. two levels below you. At the start of the next battle, bump the animal companion up to its proper level, i.e. one below you.

#### Stats & Levels

Each animal companion has roughly the same base stats as listed below.

Your animal companion is always one level lower than you. As a 1st level druid, you’ll have a level 0 animal companion. Once you gain a level, your animal companion rises to 1st level.

On top of the base stats, each type of animal has a zoologically appropriate power or advantage.

#### Companion Bonuses

Each type of animal companion is a little different.

##### Bear (also Giant Badger, Wolverine)

**Acts:** After druid

**Advantage:** The bear gains temporary hit points equal to its level each time it hits with an attack.

##### Champion Feat

The temporary hit points increase to double its level.

##### Boar (also Spiky Lizard)

**Acts:** Before druid

**Advantage:** The boar gains a +1 attack bonus when it moves before its attack during the same turn.

##### Eagle (also Falcon, Hawk, Owl, Vulture)

**Acts:** Before druid

**Advantage:** It flies! Its melee damage die is dropped by one size (d6 at level 0).

##### Panther (also Lion, Tiger)

**Acts:** Before druid

**Advantage:** The panther’s crit range expands by 2 against enemies with lower initiative.

##### Snake (also Giant Spider, Poison Toad)

**Acts:** After druid

**Advantage:** The snake also deals ongoing poison damage equal to twice your level on a natural attack roll of 18+.

##### Champion Feat

The ongoing damage is three times your level instead.

##### Epic Feat

The ongoing damage is four times your level instead.

##### Wolf (also Big Dog, Coyote, Hyena, Jackal)

**Acts:** After druid

**Advantage:** The wolf gains a +1 attack bonus against enemies its master attacked the same turn, or against enemies engaged with its master.

#### Baseline Stats

Use the following stats as the baseline for your animal companion. Remember that your companion stays a level lower than you. Generally your companion’s Physical Defense should be higher than its Mental Defense, but you could flip that if you have a good explanation.

| Level | Attack     | Damage | AC  | PD (or MD) | MD (or PD) | HP        |
| ----- | ---------- | ------ | --- | ---------- | ---------- | --------- |
| 0     | +5 vs. AC  | `dice: 1d8`     | 16  | 14| 10| 20 (10)   |
| 1     | +6 vs. AC  | `dice: 1d10`    | 17  | 15| 11| 27 (13)   |
| 2     | +7 vs. AC  | `dice: 2d6`    | 18  | 16| 12| 36 (18)   |
| 3     | +9 vs. AC  | `dice: 3d6`    | 19  | 17| 13| 45 (22)   |
| 4     | +10 vs. AC | `dice: 4d6`   | 21  | 19| 15| 54 (27)   |
| 5     | +11 vs. AC | `dice: 5d6`    | 22  | 20| 16| 72 (36)   |
| 6     | +13 vs. AC | `dice: 6d6`   | 23  | 21| 17| 90 (45)   |
| 7     | +14 vs. AC | `dice: 7d6`    | 25  | 23| 19| 108 (54)  |
| 8     | +15 vs. AC | `dice: 8d6`    | 26  | 24| 20| 144 (72)  |
| 9     | +17 vs. AC | `dice: 9d6`    | 27  | 25| 21| 180 (90)  | 
| 10    | +18 vs. AC | `dice: 10d6`   | 28  | 26| 22| 216 (108) |

#### Animal Companion Feats

Druid animal companion feats are designed so that they do not build on each other. Unlike other feats, you don’t have to take animal companion feats progressively, one after the other as long as you qualify for the correct tier.

##### Adventurer Feats

-   Once per day, your animal companion can attack twice in a round with a standard action.
    
-   Once per battle, your animal companion can turn a disengage success by an enemy it is engaged with into a failure.
    
-   Once per day, reroll one of your animal companion’s missed attack rolls.
    
-   Your animal companion adds the escalation die to its attacks.
    

##### Champion Feats

-   Once per day, your animal companion can force an enemy to reroll an attack that hit it.
    
-   Your Lethal Hunter talent also applies to your animal companion.
    
-   Increase your animal companion’s Physical Defense and Mental Defense by +1.
    

##### Epic Feats

-   Increase your animal companion’s damage die by one size (for example, from d6s to d8s, or d8s to d10s).
    
-   Increase your animal companion’s AC by +1.
    

#### Animal Companion Spells

As an Animal Companion adept, you gain a number of spells to help your animal companion—or another’s—fight better. You don’t have to choose the spells you know ahead of time. You can cast any spell of your level or lower, limited only by the number of daily spells you get. Once you cast a particular daily spell, no matter its level, you can’t cast it again until you take your next full heal-up.

Animal Companion spells are not available to Animal Companion initiates.

9th level spell: You now heal hit points equal to `dice: 2d10` + double your Wisdom modifier.

#### 9th Level Spells

##### Spirit Guardian

Ranged spell

Free action to cast

Daily

**Special Trigger:** You drop to 0 hp or below while your animal companion is nearby and still above 0 hp.

**Effect:** Your spirit trades places with the spirit of your animal companion. You now occupy the body of your animal companion, using its current hit points, defences, and attacks (and the effects of any spells cast upon it earlier).

You can’t cast spells or use your normal humanoid powers and class features while in your companion’s body. You can either keep fighting as your animal companion or you can roll a normal save as a quick action once during each of your turns; if you succeed, your body and your animal companion's body swap places while your spirits return to their proper bodies. You keep the hit points of the animal companion before you rolled the save, but can heal using a recovery when the swap is complete, if you wish. Returning to your own partially-healed body thanks to the successful save ends the spell's effect.

While your animal companion is in your body, it can roll death saves and be healed. If it becomes conscious it can attack using its basic melee attacks, but it doesn’t have access to any of your spells or powers. Any failed death saves remain with the spirit that failed them, not the body.
