## Class Features

All necromancers share the following class features.

### Arcane Implements

As a character casting arcane magic, your best options for improving your spellcasting are wands and staffs.

### Death’s Master

All necromancers must spend at least one relationship point with any necromantic icon. (This may be conflicted or negative.) If your one unique thing somehow suggests that you might be free of this requirement, make a case to your GM that this is a way in which you are unique.

### Ritual Magic

Necromancers can cast their spells as rituals (see Running the Game, Rituals).

### Spell Choices

Like other standard spellcasters, you choose the spells you will be able to cast after each full heal-up.

### Summoning

Your summoning spells use the standard summoning rules. The following feats enable you to improve your summoning powers.

#### Adventurer Feat

Your summoned creatures can add the escalation die to their attacks.

#### Champion Feat

When you summon mooks, increase the number of mooks you summon by 1.

#### Epic Feat

The first time one of your non-mook summoned creatures is dropped each battle, roll a normal save. If you succeed, the summoned creature is not slain but instead remains in the battle with 10 hp.

### Wasting Away

Necromancers are frail, gaunt, parched, skinny, sickly, wasted, cadaverous, dependent on unearthly substances, or partially dead. This isn’t just an aesthetic note—as a necromancer, you must subtract your Constitution modifier from all your necromancer spell attacks if your modifier is positive. In addition, you don’t die until you fail five death saves. Similarly, you don’t succumb to last gasp save effects until you fail the fifth save.

#### Adventurer Feat

If your Constitution modifier is negative, add +1 to your necromancer spell attacks.

#### Champion Feat

You don’t die from damage until your negative hit points equal your maximum hit points, instead of half your maximum.

#### Epic Feat

One battle per day, you can choose to succeed with death saves on an 11+ instead of a 16+.

## Class Talents

### Cackling Soliloquist

If you spend your move action, your quick action, *and* your standard action casting a daily spell that ordinarily only requires a standard action—while screaming grandiloquently, cackling maniacally, or megalomaniacally describing the grandeur of your plans and the futility of your enemies’ resistance—the daily spell is recharge 18+ after battle instead of daily, and you can invent a slight improvement to the spell, especially if it’s partly story-oriented, that provides an extra benefit determined by the GM or by you (with GM approval).

#### Adventurer Feat

You gain temporary hit points equal to `dice: 1d6` + your level + Charisma modifier when you use Cackling Soliloquist (double your Charisma modifier at 5th level; triple it at 8th level).

#### Champion Feat

Your soliloquized spell is now a recharge 16+ after battle instead of 18+.

#### Epic Feat

Once per day, you can hog the spotlight when using Cackling Soliloquist. When you do, you heal using a free recovery and steal the escalation die, keeping it all to yourself. Until the end of your next turn, you are the only creature—PC, NPC, or monster—that can use the escalation die, *and* you treat the escalation die as if it were an 8. At the end of your next turn, return the escalation die to the table, one point higher than it was when you seized it.

### Dead Wizard

You gain the Cantrips class feature from the wizard class. The talent functions like the wizard’s class feature with the following exceptions:

-   You can’t cast *mending*.
-   Your *light* cantrip has a sickly flicker or a dark edge. Feel free to call it *darklight*.

#### Adventurer Feat

You can take a wizard spell in place of one of your necromancer spells of the same level. You can change this spell for a new one you know whenever you take a full heal-up.

#### Champion Feat

You gain a bonus wizard spell that is at least two levels below your level_**,**_ in addition to the spells you can cast as a necromancer. You can change this spell for a new one you know whenever you take a full heal-up.

#### Epic Feat

You gain a second bonus wizard spell, but this one can be of your level or lower. You can change this spell for a new one you know whenever you take a full heal-up.

### Death Priest

When you have icon relationship advantages you’re waiting to use during a session, you can interpret them as interactions/public discussions with the spirits of the recent or ancient dead in the area, providing information you require (and possibly, when there’s a complication from a 5 roll, also providing that information to your enemies or otherwise getting you into some type of trouble).

***Séance:*** Similarly, once per day while you’re not in battle, you can perform a short rite (1–2 minutes) to call upon a spirit of the dead that’s related to a random icon other than a necromantic icon. The spirit will speak to you, relaying information helpfully, or under protest if it’s related to an icon that considers you an enemy or with which you have a negative relationship.

You can’t always rely on the dead to speak the truth, or to know what they are talking about. Whenever you use the séance power above, the GM secretly rolls a d20 before the discussion. On a 3+, the spirit knows what it is talking about. On a 1–2, the information is outdated, sabotaged, or just erroneous. (Note that this roll is only used for séances, not for spirits you talk to thanks to icon advantages mentioned above.)

At 5th level you can use séance two times per day. At 8th level you can use it three times per day.

#### Adventurer Feat

Whenever you take a full heal-up, you can choose whether you’d like to move a single point in a relationship with a positively or negatively aligned icon to one of the other icons. Tell a story of what has taken place to cause the shift, unless it’s already obvious from the events of the campaign. When you shift this relationship, the new point must match any current relationships with that icon, but it can be positive, negative, or conflicted if it’s currently the only point you have with that icon.

#### Champion Feat

You gain a bonus cleric spell that is at least two levels below your level, in addition to the spells you can cast as a necromancer. You can change this spell for a new one you know whenever you take a full heal-up. You can also substitute references to Wisdom with references to Intelligence in the spell.

#### Epic Feat

You gain the lowest-tier feat, if any, associated with your bonus cleric spell.

### Deathknell

As a quick action, you can drop a nearby enemy that has 5 hp or fewer down to 0 hp. When you drop an enemy using Deathknell, you heal `dice: 1d6` hit points.

You can use Deathknell to drop a mook, but only if it’s the last mook in its mob and the mob has 5 hp or fewer left.

3rd level spell: Drop an enemy with 10 hp or fewer. Heal `dice: 1d10`hit points.

5th level spell: Drop an enemy with 15 hp or fewer. Heal `dice: 2d8` hit points.

7th level spell: Drop an enemy with 20 hp or fewer. Heal `dice: 4d6`hit points.

9th level spell: Drop an enemy with 25 hp or fewer. Heal `dice: 4d8` hit points.

#### Adventurer Feat

When you use Deathknell, one of your nearby conscious allies can gain the healing instead of you.

#### Champion Feat

Double the healing gained from Deathknell when you drop an enemy.

#### Epic Feat

You can increase the escalation die by 1 instead of healing when you kill a non-mook enemy with Deathknell.

### It’s Complicated

When you roll icon relationship dice, the first 6 you roll is a 5 instead.

You gain an extra necromancer spell at the highest spell level you can normally cast (as shown under spells known on the necromancer level progression chart). For example, you would gain an extra 3rd level spell if you’re 4th level, or an extra 5th level spell if you’re 5th level.

#### Champion Feat

All 6s you roll with relationship dice count as 5s. You gain another extra necromancer spell, but it must be at least two levels lower than your level.

### Redeemer

Undead you summon release holy energy bursts as they drop to 0 hp, dealing a small amount of damage to each enemy engaged with them.

Mooks you summon deal holy damage equal to your Charisma modifier (double your Charisma modifier at 5th level; triple it at 8th level).

Non-mooks you summon deal holy damage equal to your Charisma modifier x `dice: 1d4` (`dice: 1d8` at 5th level; `dice: 2d6` at 8th level).

In story terms, you’re not likely to have a positive relationship with any necromantic icons if you take the Redeemer talent.

#### Adventurer Feat

The first time each battle an undead creature you have summoned attacks, it gains an attack bonus equal to your Charisma modifier.

#### Champion Feat

When one of your summoned undead creatures drops to 0 hp, instead of having it deal holy damage to engaged enemies, you can heal hit points equal to that damage instead.

#### Epic Feat

You can memorize a single spell that summons undead twice.

### Skeletal Minion

You have a skeleton minion the same level as you that acts as a servant, fights alongside you in battle, and is replaced by a new skeletal minion when it inevitably collapses or is destroyed. It is not a summoned create; summoning rules don’t ap\ply.

Your minion acts on your initiative, taking a standard action, a move action, and (if applicable) a quick action. You decide whether it takes its turn before or after you.

The listed attack and damage values are for melee attacks. Your skeletal minion can’t heal. When it drops to 0 hp, it’s destroyed for that battle. When you take a quick rest, a new (or patched up) skeletal minion will take its place.

#### Skeletal Minion Feats

Like animal companion feats, skeletal minion feats don’t build on each other. You don’t have to take them in a particular order, as long as you qualify for the tier.

##### Adventurer Feats

-   Your skeletal minion now adds the escalation die to its attack rolls.
-   When an enemy attempts to disengage from the skeletal minion, it takes a penalty to the check equal to the escalation die.
-   As a quick action, you can set your skeletal minion ablaze, or extinguish the blaze. While it’s flaming, your skeleton minion’s damage dice increase by one size, and it deals fire damage with its melee attacks, but it takes damage equal to your level each time its natural attack roll is odd.

##### Champion Feats

-   Add a damage die of the same size to your skeletal minion’s damage rolls (for example, `dice: 3d6` becomes 4d6).
-   Add double your Charisma modifier to your skeletal minion’s hit points. At 8th level, add triple it.  
-   Add a damage die of the same size to your skeletal minion’s damage rolls (for example, `dice: 4d6`becomes 5d6, and this is cumulative with the champion feat).

##### Epic Feats

-   Your skeletal minion gains a +2 bonus to all defences.

### Sorta Dead

In some ways, you’re dead already. You don’t need to eat or sleep or breathe. You can’t drown in normal water/liquid, though magical gas will still affect you.

When a spell or effect targets or applies to undead, you can decide whether you want to count as undead for that specific effect. (For example, you could count as undead to take advantage of a target’s vulnerability created by the *ripping claws* attack of a starving ghoul mook you summoned via *summon undead*.)

The first time you die each level, roll a normal save, adding your Charisma modifier. If you succeed, you heal using a free recovery instead of dying. If you were dying because of last gasp saves, consider yourself saved from the last gasp problem also.

#### Adventurer Feat

You gain *resist poison 16+* and *resist negative energy 16+*.

#### Champion Feat

The spells *zombie form*, *ghoul form*, *ghost form*, and *vampiric form* all function as recharge 16+ after battle spells for you, though you still memorize them as daily spells.

#### Epic Feat

No undead creature that is not under the direct command of a necromantic icon can attack you unless you attack it or cast a spell against it first.

## 1st Level Spells

**Attack Target:** One *random* nearby creature other than the healing target

**Healing Target:** One nearby ally

**Attack:** Intelligence + Level vs. MD (make one attack only against the attack target)

**Hit vs. an enemy:** `dice: 2d6` + Intelligence negative energy damage, and the healing target can heal using a recovery.

**Hit vs. an ally:** 5 negative energy damage, and the healing target can heal using a recovery.

**Miss:** The spell is not expended.

3rd level spell: `dice: 5d6` damage vs. enemy, 10 damage vs. ally.

5th level spell: `dice: 5d10`damage vs. enemy, 15 damage vs. ally.

7th level spell: `dice: 7d10`damage vs. enemy, 20 damage vs. ally.

#### Adventurer Feat

You can now cast this spell twice per battle.

#### Champion Feat

Staggered allies can no longer be an attack target of the spell.

#### Epic Feat

On a miss, the spell now deals half damage to the target, but there is still no effect on the healing target.

### Chant of Endings

Ranged spell

At-Will

**Target:** The nearby enemy with the fewest hit points (you choose if there’s a tie; you also don’t have to be able to see that enemy)

**Attack:** Intelligence + Level vs. MD

**Hit:** `dice: 1d10`+ Intelligence negative energy damage.

3rd level spell: `dice: 4d6`damage.

5th level spell: `dice: 6d6`damage.

#### Champion Feat

Misses now deal damage equal to your level.

#### Epic Feat

While the escalation die is 4+, you can now target two nearby enemies with the fewest hit points with this spell.

### Command Undead

Ranged spell

Once per battle

**Target:** One nearby undead creature with 64 hp or fewer

7th level spell: Target with 266 hp or fewer.

9th level spell: Target with 460 hp or fewer.

#### Adventurer Feat

A miss doesn’t expend the spell.

#### Champion Feat

If you wish, the target doesn’t make any attacks while confused. Instead it becomes compliant, answers short questions if possible, and follows other suggestions that don’t lead directly to damaging itself or other creatures. Basically, while confused it becomes a slightly puzzled friend, which may wonder why your other friends are hurting it while it’s trying to be helpful.

***Epic Feat***

The target now adds the escalation die to its attacks while confused by this spell_._

### Death’s Gauntlet

Ranged spell

At-Will

**Target:** One nearby creature

**Attack:** Intelligence + Level vs. PD

**Hit:** `dice: 1d4` + Intelligence modifier ongoing negative energy damage.

*Special:* Instead of taking the ongoing damage at the end of its turn, the target can use its standard action to strike out at the skeletal limbs or spectral arms that are flailing at it. When it does, the ongoing damage ends and you can’t use *death’s gauntlet* again until the end of your next turn.

**Miss:** Damage equal to your level.

3rd level spell: `dice: 2d8` damage.

5th level spell: `dice: 4d6`damage.

7th level spell: `dice: 6d6`damage.

9th level spell: `dice: 7d10`damage.

#### Adventurer Feat

When a target uses a standard action to end *death’s gauntlet* ongoing damage, it takes negative energy damage equal to your level.

#### Champion Feat

When you roll a natural even hit against a target with this spell, the ongoing negative energy damage has a hard save (16+).

#### Epic Feat

The spell can also target MD instead of PD.

### Summon Undead (1st level+)

Ranged spell

Daily

**Effect:** You summon a mob of `dice: 1d3` + 1 crumbling skeleton mooks, as per the summoning rules. These skeletons fight for you until the end of the battle or until they drop to 0 hp, whichever comes first.

As you cast the spell at higher levels, the mooks you summon vary, as shown below. The stats for each mob of mooks you can summon are also shown below.

3rd level spell: `dice: 1d3` + 1 putrid zombie mooks.

5th level spell: `dice: 1d3` + 1 starving ghoul mooks.

7th level spell: `dice: 1d3` + 1 masterless vampire spawn mooks.

9th level spell: `dice: 1d3` + 1 Blackamber skeletal warrior mooks.

#### Champion Feat

You now summon `dice: 1d4` + 1 mooks when you cast this spell instead of `dice: 1d3` + 1.

#### Epic Feat

If one or more mooks summoned by the spell survive the battle, you can keep one mook with you until the next battle. Or until someone in the party or the world gets sick of it and slays the thing.

#### Crumbling Skeleton

| Normal 1st level Mook Undead  | Initiative: +6 Vulnerability: holy  Sword +6 vs. AC—3 damage  Resist weapons 16+: When a weapon attack targets this creature, the attacker must roll a natural 16+ on the attack roll or it only deals half damage. | AC PD MD HP | 16 14 10 6 |

|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|

|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|

### Speak with Dead

Ranged spell

Variable

*Special:* You can use this spell `dice: 1d3` times each day (roll during a full heal-up when you take it). Each time you use the spell, you must wait `dice: 1d6` hours before casting it again.

**Target:** One corpse you are touching that has been dead less than a day. Note that creatures that were undead for a longer period before they were killed are not legal targets.

**Effect:** You can ask the corpse a number of yes/no questions that the leftover fragments of personality/spirit within the corpse will attempt to answer truthfully using the information it had when it died.* The magic uses the caster’s knowledge of language so no translation is needed. The first question is free. The second question requires a DC 15 necromancy skill check using Intelligence if the corpse is “friendly,” and Charisma if the corpse is not. Increase the DC by +5 for each subsequent question after the second. If you’re using this spell during battle, each question and answer requires a round.

*Note:* Just as with the *séance* ability of the Death Priest talent, there’s always a 10% chance that the spirit summoned is going to lie to you for reasons best known to it and to the GM. The GM rolls a d20 secretly before the corpse provides any answers; a 3+ means the spirit will speak truly, but a 1 or a 2 means it will lie while appearing to be aiming for the truth.

5th level spell: You can now cast this spell `dice: 1d4` times per day, targeting corpses or even just heads that have been dead up to a week.

7th level spell: Questions can now be phrased to receive three-word answers, targeting corpses/heads that have been dead up to a month.

### Wave of Decay

Ranged spell

Daily

**Effect:** Choose a nearby enemy. It takes `dice: 2d6` negative energy damage for each point on the escalation die. (For example, if the escalation die is 2 when you cast the spell, you’ll deal `dice: 4d6`negative energy damage to the target.)

Until the end of the battle, as a free action at the start of each of your turns, repeat the effect above, choosing a target and dealing damage based on the escalation die value.

The effect ends at the end of the battle, when you drop to 0 hp, or when your *wave of decay* damage drops an enemy to 0 hit points!

## Summoning Rules

These general rules also apply to the druid’s Elemental Caster class talent.

### Standard Action Spells

Casting a summoning spell generally requires a standard action. The creature(s) you summon appears next to you, though feats or powers might enable you to summon it nearby instead.

### Duration

A summoned creature fights for you until the end of the battle or until it drops to 0 hit points. At 0 hp, summoned creatures are slain and removed from the battle.

### One Summoning Spell at a time

Each spellcaster can have only a single summoning spell active at a time. If all the creatures from an earlier summoning spell have been slain, you’re free to cast another. Alternatively, you can dismiss your own previously summoned creatures as a quick action to clear the way for a new summoning spell.

### Halfway there

Summoned creatures are not the same as real creatures. They’re partly real, partly magical. Their abilities don’t always match the capabilities of the creatures that the adventurers encounter *for real*. Sometimes this is reflected in a summoned creature’s attacks or abilities. It’s always reflected in a summoned creature’s hit points.

### Hit Points

Each summoned creature stat block indicates its base hit points. Starting hit points for summoned creatures are nearly always lower than hit points for non-summoned versions of the same creature. Some class feats might increase the hit points of summoned creatures.

### Actions on Arrival

The turn you summon a creature, that creature takes its turn immediately after your turn in initiative order. During its turn, the summoned creature can act like any other creature, taking a standard, move, and quick action. The summoned creature continues to take its turn immediately after you (even if your initiative order changes) until the end of the battle.

### Escalation Die

As a rule, summoned creatures don’t benefit from the escalation die. A summoned creature can add the escalation die to attacks, however, if *you use a quick action* to give it orders or magical reinforcement. The summoned creature then gets to use the escalation die until the start of your next turn, including for opportunity attacks and other attacks that it gets to make during other creatures’ turns.

For example, during the turn you summon the creature, you use a quick action afterward to give it orders, allowing it to use the escalation die bonus. At the start of your next turn, the creature no longer gets to use the escalation die, so you’ll have to use another quick action again during that turn for the creature to keep getting the benefit.

If you’ve summoned a mob of mooks, a single quick action lets every member of the mob use the escalation die.

### Allies

Summoned creatures generally count as your allies (for roleplaying as well as for resolving effects).

### No Recoveries, Bad Healing

Summoned creatures don’t have recoveries. If you cast a healing spell on a summoned creature that requires the use of a recovery, the summoned creature heals hit points equal to your level. If you use an effect that would heal a summoned creature without using a recovery, the summoned creature only heals half the normal hit points of the effect. Temporary hit points still work normally.

### No Nastier Specials

Creatures you summon don’t use nastier specials.

### Spell or Creature

When a summoning spell is cast, it’s definitely a spell. After casting the spell, a summoned creature is a creature.
