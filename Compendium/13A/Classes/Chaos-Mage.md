## Class Features

Chaos mages use arcane implements, such as wands and staffs, to improve their attacks. Unlike wizards and clerics, chaos mages don’t choose the spells they know. Instead, a chaos mage of a given level can access all the spells in a category that are their level or lower.

The category of spell you’ll cast on your turn is randomly decided, but you get to decide how many of your resources you’ll use. You have a limited number of daily and once-per-battle spells, so each turn you must decide whether to use one of the powerful spells in the category you’re casting from or whether you’ll stick with an at-will spell.

Chaos mages are not allowed to cast rituals.

### Chaos Magic

Chaos magic has three main categories of spells: attack, defence, and iconic.

Since the category of magic spells you’ll cast is randomly chosen, you’ll need 6 “stones” (gems, beads, poker chips, or whatever you like) of three different colors—two stones for each color. You’ll also need a bag (or cup) to put them in and draw them from. Put two of each color into the bag, then assign one color to attack, one color to defence, and the last color to iconic.

If you’d rather use dice instead of stones in a bag, use a d6; 1-2 is attack, 3-4 is defence, 5-6 is iconic.

You draw a stone from the bag to determine the next type of spell you’ll be able to cast. You usually do this when you roll initiative at the start of a battle, at the end of your turn (to set up the spell you can cast during your next turn), or as required during your turn if you somehow get an extra standard action.

Each stone you draw should be set aside so that each turn you draw from a smaller pool of stones. When there is one stone left in the bag, don’t draw it. Instead, refill the bag with the other six stones and draw. At the end of the battle, refill the bag.

If you draw…
-   Attack: The next chaos mage spell you cast during the battle must be an attack spell, but you won’t have to choose the spell until your turn.
-   Defence: The next chaos mage spell you cast during the battle must be a defence spell, but you won’t have to choose the spell until your turn.
-   Iconic: The next chaos mage spell you cast during the battle must be an iconic spell. Immediately roll a die to determine which icon’s spells you’ll have to choose from. For example, if there are 12 icons in your game, assign a number to each icon and roll a d12. You don’t have to choose the specific spell until your turn.

Whether you cast an at-will, per-battle, or daily spell, you cast it at the spell level shown on the spell progression table.

**Adventurer Feat**  
Once per day when you cast an iconic daily or once-per-battle spell from an icon you have at least a one-point relationship with, roll a normal save. If you succeed, you don’t expend that spell, allowing you to cast it again, or another daily/once-per-battle spell.

**Champion Feat**  
Once per day when you draw an iconic spell, before rolling, choose an icon you have at least a one-point relationship with. The spell you cast next will be from that icon.

**Epic Feat**  
You can use the champion feat power a second time, but only if you choose an icon that you have at least a two-point relationship with.

**High Weirdness**  
Chaos mages usually display an uncanny weirdness that presents itself through their spellcasting, and sometimes even bleeds through to their general demeanor. This weirdness is represented in game mechanics through the High Weirdness table below.

When an enemy scores a critical hit against you, roll high weirdness and consult the table to see what effect applies. If you hate the effect you’re experiencing, you can use a standard action to change it. Unless otherwise specified, the high weirdness effects last until the end of the battle.

Unless otherwise specified, the high weirdness effects last until the end of the battle.

**Adventurer Feat**  
If you have one or more Warp talents, whenever you make a d6 roll for one, also roll for a new high weirdness effect. The new effect replaces the weirdness effect currently active, if any.

If you have no Warp talents, roll for a new high weirdness effect whenever you draw an iconic spell.

**Champion Feat**  
Once per battle when you roll for a high weirdness effect, roll twice and use both results. Reroll duplicate results.

**Epic Feat**  
One battle per day, each time you roll for a high weirdness effect, roll twice and use both results. Reroll duplicate results.

**High Weirdness Table**  

| `dice: 1d100` | High Weirdness Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1–2           | You accidentally summon `dice: 1d3` wibbles that either attack you or drift off to wreak a small amount of havoc elsewhere in the battle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 3–4           | You’re hit by a pulsing wrinkle in time. You move and speak ever–so–slightly slower than you should until you catch up. There’s no effect this turn, but at the end of your turn, decrease your initiative `dice: 2d6` points, to a minimum of 1.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 5–6           | Each creature in the battle with temporary hit points loses half of them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 7–8           | You can only speak by asking questions. If you or your character violates this requirement, your character takes 1 damage the first time, 2 damage the second time, and so on. (Have another player keep track.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 9–10          | Your magic items’ quirks take over. If you aren’t doing a good enough job of roleplaying this personality fiasco, the GM and the rest of the players are authorized to suggest (in)appropriate behavior.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 11            | You leech personality traits from surrounding spirits, whatever those happen to be. These are only traits, not personality overrides.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 12            | You must speak in what you think could be the voice of the last creature your chaos mage attacked. If it doesn’t seem to have a voice, invent one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 13            | Small squeaking rodents erupt from any plausible cover that you go near. There’s no real effect except they’re somewhat noisy and rodents suddenly pop up in unexpected places.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 14            | Your (the PC) favorite song begins playing around you magically, getting louder and louder (tell the table what type of song it is, or maybe hum it). It might or might not interfere with bardic songs or monsters that need to be heard properly to get their dirty work done.                                                                                                                                                |
| 15            | A disembodied voice begins narrating the events of the battle to all participants. The voice isn't necessarily on your side, pick a random icon it seems to be associated with.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 16            | You grow horns or other spikes all over. If you already have horns, then you lose them. Some of the horns, or lack thereof, persist after the weirdness ends.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 17            | One of your arms becomes a functional tentacle. It has no mechanical effects, but unless you’re special or lucky it’s probably not a very pretty tentacle. Your option on whether or not it remains after the weirdness ends.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 18            | A great gust of wind circles around the battlefield. It probably has no serious effect unless there’s something happening that a great gust of wind could seriously affect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 19            | All creatures leave coloured trails behind them as they move, turning the battle scene into a strange glowing artwork.

| 21–22         | Grit, explosive dust, or other debris explodes into the air around you, dealing `dice: 1d4` damage per tier to each nearby creature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 23–24         | There’s tension in the air, or the rumble of distant thunder, or a sense of impending disaster, and the next creature that misses with an attack this battle takes damage equal your Charisma modifier (double your Charisma modifier at 5th level; triple it at 8th level).                                                                                                                                                    |
| 25–26         | Quickly passing auras blur and shake across the battlefield, or cold winds whip through and grow warmer as they pass, or the lights flicker … and the creature that has taken the most damage in the battle gains temporary hit points equal to 10% of its maximum hit points.                                                                                                                                                  |
| 27–28         | One random creature in the battle other than you teleports next to and is engaged by one of its random enemies other than you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

## Class Talents

Choose three of the following class talents.

### Warp Talents

There are three separate Warp talents that you may choose from. They provide random powers or features that surface unpredictably during battles (and perhaps during non-combat moments of high tension).

If a warp talent gives you access to a spell from another class, associate it with chaos magic’s attack category or defence category. You can then cast it if that spell type comes up for you.

#### Attacking Warp

Your magic provides you with a random warp effect when the next spell you cast will be an attack spell. This talent works best for chaos mages with a high Dexterity.

When your random spell choice indicates an attack spell, roll a d6 to determine the effect you’ll gain from the elemental warp. Even though you can’t cast the spell until your next turn, the warp effect applies now.

| `dice: 1d6` | Effect|
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1  | Air: You gain flight until the end of your next turn.       |
| 2  | Earth: Until the end of your next turn, each enemy that misses you with a melee attack is stuck until the end of its next turn.     |
| 3  | Fire: Until the end of your next turn, you can pop free from staggered enemies as a quick action.        |
| 4  | Water: You gain a bonus to disengage checks until the end of your next turn equal to your Dexterity modifier      |
| 5  | Metal: Until the end of your next turn, when an enemy disengages from you, it takes damage equal to your Dexterity modifier (double your Dexterity modifier at 5th level; triple it at 8th level). |
| 6  | Void: During your next turn, you can use a move action to teleport to a nearby location you can see.     |      
^13A-Class-Chaos-Mage-Attacking-Warp

**Adventurer Feat**  

When you roll a successful disengage check, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Dexterity modifier (double your Dexterity modifier at 5th level; triple it at 8th level).

**Champion Feat**  

While you are flying due to any effect, you gain a bonus to disengage checks equal to your Dexterity modifier.

Calendarium
Dice Roller
Initiative
Statblocks


**Epic Feat**

When one of your spells or powers lets you teleport to a nearby location, you can instead teleport to a faraway location you can see.

#### Defensive Warp

Your magic provides you with a random warp effect when the next spell you cast will be a defence spell. This talent works best for chaos mages with a high Wisdom.

When your random spell choice indicates a defence spell, roll a d6 to determine the effect you’ll gain from the elemental warp. Even though you can’t cast the spell until your next turn, the warp effect applies now.

| `dice: 1d6` | Effect      |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1  | **Air**: Once before the end of your next turn, you can heal using a recovery as a quick action. |
| 2  | **Earth**: You gain temporary hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier (double your Wisdom modifier at 5th level; triple it at 8th level).    |
| 3  | **Fire**: Until the end of your next turn, when an enemy moves to engage you, it takes fire damage equal to your Wisdom modifier (double your Wisdom modifier at 5th level; triple it at 8th level).|
| 4  | **Water**: Until the end of your next turn, when you heal using a recovery, add hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier to that healing (double your Wisdom modifier at 5th level; triple it at 8th level). |
| 5  | Metal: Until the end of your next turn, you gain a +2 bonus to AC.|
| 6  | **Void**: Until the end of your next turn, the first time an attack hits you, as a free action you can choose to lose hit points equal to your level to force the attacker to reroll the attack.    |      
^13A-Class-Chaos-Mage-Defensive-Warp  
**Adventurer Feat**  
When you heal using a recovery, add hit points equal to the escalation die to that healing.

**Champion Feat**  
While you are at maximum hit points, you gain a +1 bonus to all defences.

**Epic Feat**  
When an attacker rerolls an attack against you, it takes an attack penalty equal to your Wisdom modifier.

#### Iconic Warp

Your magic provides you with a random warp effect when the next spell you cast will be an iconic spell. This talent works best for chaos mages with a high Intelligence.

When your random spell choice indicates an iconic spell, roll a d6 to determine the effect you’ll gain from the elemental warp. Even though you can’t cast the spell until your next turn, the warp effect applies now.

| `dice: 1d6` | Effect  |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | **Air**: Randomly determine two icon associations for the spell you’ll cast instead of one. Choose one of those associations to use for that spell.|
| 2 | **Earth**: Until the end of your next turn, you gain a bonus to PD and MD equal to your Intelligence modifier. |
| 3 | **Fire**: Until the end of your next turn, you gain the once-per-battle racial power of a random nearby ally; ignore this benefit if it duplicates your own racial power or if it doesn’t make sense during the battle (human, for example). |
| 4 | **Water**: Until the end of your next turn, you gain a bonus to saves equal to your Intelligence modifier.     |
| 5 | **Metal**: Until the end of your next turn, critical hits scored against you only count as normal hits.        |
| 6 | **Void**: When you roll a natural 20 with an attack, the critical hit range of your attacks expands by 2 until the end of the battle (cumulative). |      
^13A-Class-Chaos-Mage-Iconic-Warp  
**Adventurer Feat**  
Once per battle when you roll for an iconic warp effect, roll the d6 twice and choose the result you want.

**Champion Feat**  
When you roll a natural 18–20 on a save, a nearby ally of your choice can roll a save against a save ends effect.

**Epic Feat**  
When you roll a natural 20 with an attack, the critical hit range of your attacks expands by 2 until the end of the battle (cumulative).

### Separate Existence

You are ever-so-slightly detached from normal physical reality. Play the story side of that as you like; the game mechanics side is that you can cast ranged spells while engaged with enemies without taking opportunity attacks.

**Adventurer Feat**  
While you have an *air* or *void* warp effect active, you take no damage from missed attacks.

**Champion Feat**  
When you teleport, you can heal using a recovery.

### Stench of Necromancy

You gain a random spell from the necromancer class. Whenever you take a full heal-up, randomly choose a necromancer spell of the highest level you can cast. For the rest of the day, you know this necromancer spell and can cast it according to its normal usage pattern—at-will, once per battle, recharge, or daily—when that option comes up during your chaos mage spellcasting sequence.

If the necromancer spell refers to Intelligence, you can replace that ability score with references to Charisma.

**Adventurer Feat**  
One battle per day, you can gain the Cackling Soliloquist talent from the necromancer class.

**Champion Feat**  
While you have an *earth* or *metal* warp effect active, when an enemy in the battle drops to 0 hp, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier (double your Charisma modifier at 5th level; triple it at 8th level).

**Epic Feat**  
If you don’t like the first random necromancer spell you select for the day, you can determine another random necromancer spell. You’re stuck with the second one.

### Touch of Wizardry

You gain a random spell from the wizard class. Whenever you take a full heal-up, randomly choose a wizard spell of the highest level you can cast. For the rest of the day, you know this wizard spell and can cast it according to its normal usage pattern—at-will, cyclic, once per battle, recharge, or daily—when that option comes up during your chaos mage spellcasting sequence.

If the wizard spell refers to Intelligence, you can replace that ability score with references to Charisma.

**Adventurer Feat**  
You gain a random wizard talent at the start of each day. Roll a d3. 

1: Abjuration
2: Evocation
3: High Arcana (*counter magic*). 

Replace references to “wizard” in these talents with “chaos mage” and Intelligence with Charisma.

**Champion Feat**  
You gain a single daily use of the wizard’s *utility spell*, cast at your level or lower.

**Epic Feat**  
If you don’t like the first random wizard spell you select for the day, you can determine another random wizard spell. You’re stuck with the second one.

### Trace of the Divine

You gain a random spell from the cleric class. Whenever you take a full heal-up, randomly choose a cleric spell of the highest level you can cast. For the rest of the day, you know this cleric spell and can cast it according to its normal usage pattern—at-will, once per battle, recharge, or daily—when that option comes up during your chaos mage spellcasting sequence.

If the cleric spell refers to Wisdom, you can replace that ability score with references to Charisma.

**Adventurer Feat**  
At the start of the day, choose a random cleric invocation, excepting those from the healing domain. You can use that invocation as if you were a cleric once this day as a quick action.

**Champion Feat**  
While you have an *air* or *water* warp effect active, when you heal using a recovery or cast a spell that lets an ally heal using a recovery, add an extra recovery die to the healing.

**Epic Feat**  
In addition to the random invocation you gain at the start of the day, you also get the talent/domain powers that go with it.

### Whiff of Sorcery

You gain a random spell from the sorcerer class. Whenever you take a full heal-up, randomly choose a sorcerer spell of the highest level you can cast. For the rest of the day, you know this sorcerer spell and can cast it according to its normal usage pattern—at-will, once per battle, recharge, or daily—when that option comes up during your chaos mage spellcasting sequence.

**Adventurer Feat**  
Twice per day, you can gather power as if you were a sorcerer in order to deal double damage with either a sorcerer spell or a chaos mage spell the next time you cast a spell. You also gain the chaotic benefit for gathering power. (Note that you should have already determined the type of spell you will be casting, since you select a spell type when you roll initiative and at the end of each turn, so you’re generally better off waiting to gather power when you know you have an attack or iconic spell coming.)

**Champion Feat**  
While you have an *air* or *fire* warp effect active, add fire damage equal to your Charisma modifier to your miss damage (double your Charisma modifier at 5th level; triple it at 8th level).

**Epic Feat**  
If you don’t like the first random sorcerer spell you select for the day, you can determine another random sorcerer spell. You’re stuck with the second one.

## Iconic Spells & Feats

In setting up your game universe, you should have a set of icons. Distribute them more or less evenly into the spell groups below according to the theme that matches best (Blood of Warriors, Light of the High Ones, Twisted Path). When the chaos mage rolls a particular icon, they can choose any spell associate that that icon’s group of spells.

Multiple icons should belong to each group. Each group should have at-will spells and at least one per-battle and daily spell.
