- A wizard needs one free hand on a spellcasting implement to cast spells. As such, they suffer a penalty for using a two-handed weapon. (The penalty applies to spells also.)

### Class Features

Wizards have four class features: Cantrips, Cyclic Spells, Overworld Advantage, and Ritual Magic.

#### Cantrips

Every wizard can cast a handful of cantrips each day. You don’t have to memorize or choose them beforehand, you just cast them on the fly.

Wizards can cast a number of cantrips equal to their Intelligence modifier each battle. Each cantrip takes a standard action to cast as a ranged spell. Outside of battle, a wizard can cast about three to six cantrips every five minutes. The Cantrip Mastery talent speeds up cantrip casting.

At the adventurer tier (levels 1–4), cantrips with a standard duration last 10–60 minutes, plus 10 minutes per wizard level. The GM rolls and the wizard becomes aware that their cantrip is about to end a couple minutes before it’s done.

At the champion tier, levels 5–7, most cantrips last 1–6 hours.

At the epic tier, levels 8–10, cantrips last between 2–12 hours.

For a list of available cantrips, see Cantrips.

#### Cyclic Spells

Spells that have a cyclic usage can always be cast at least once per battle, and are only expended in that battle if they are cast when the escalation die is 0 or odd. In other words, if you cast a cyclic spell like color spray or rebuke when the escalation die is even, the spell is not expended and can still be cast later in the battle.

#### Overworld Advantage

Wizardly magic taps into the power of the overworld. While a wizard is in the overworld, their daily spells become recharge 16+ after battle.

#### Ritual Magic

Wizards can cast their spells as rituals.

##### Champion Feat

You can cast full rituals by using all your actions each round to focus on the ritual for `dice: 1d3` + 1 rounds. As with standard rituals, your fast rituals are not meant to replace combat spells; they’re a means of acquiring and improvising wondrous magical effects rather than a means of inflicting damage and conditions.

### Class Talents

Choose three of the following class talents.

#### Abjuration

Whenever you cast a daily wizard spell, you gain a +4 AC bonus until the end of your next turn.

##### Adventurer Feat

The bonus also applies to your Physical Defense.

##### Champion Feat

You gain `dice: 2d12` temporary hit points each time you cast a daily spell.

##### Epic Feat

The bonus also applies to Mental Defense.

#### Cantrip Mastery

Cantrips are at-will spells for you.

Unlike normal wizards, who use a standard action to cast a cantrip, you can cast a cantrip as a quick action.

To do something particularly cunning or surprising with one of your cantrips where the GM isn’t sure whether you could pull off that use of the spell, roll a normal save (11+) to cast the spell the way you envision it.

Additionally, you can expend a 3rd level spell slot or higher to choose one cantrip per spell slot you have given up and create a once-per-day related effect with it that is much greater, if you and your GM can agree on a cool effect that suits the cantrip.

##### Adventurer Feat

You can use cantrip-style versions of any wizard spell you have memorized. When you expend a spell, however, you can’t make cantrip-style use of it any more. The key is that none of these uses should be combat relevant or deal damage.

The Cantrip Mastery talent is more about enhance the roleplaying and less about combat usefulness.

#### Evocation

Once per battle, when you cast a spell that targets Physical Defense, before rolling for the number of targets or making the spell’s attack roll, you can expend your quick action to evoke the spell. Hit or miss, you'll max out the spell’s damage dice (except on a natural one, which deals no damage to the target and likely damages the caster in some manner).

##### Champion Feat

Whenever you evoke a spell, you can reroll one of the attack rolls if that natural roll was less than or equal to the escalation die. You must take the new result.

#### High Arcana

Your study of the highest orders of magic gives you options that lesser wizards cannot match: Memorization and a bonus spell: counter-magic

##### Memorization

When you pick your spells, you can choose any daily wizard spell twice (instead of once). This doesn’t apply to spells that start as recharge spells. For example, at 7th level when you have five 7th level spells and four 5th level spells, you could choose fireball twice as a 7th level spell, or once as a 7th level spell and once as a 5th level spell. (Your 3rd level spell slot can’t be used for fireball because fireball starts as a 5th level spell.)

##### Counter-magic

Close-quarters spell

Once per battle

Free action to cast

Trigger: A nearby creature you can see casts a spell.

**Target:** The nearby creature casting a spell.

**Attack:** Intelligence + Level vs. MD

**Hit:** The target’s spell is canceled, and the caster loses the action they were using for the spell. If the spell had a limited use, that use is expended if your natural attack roll is even.

##### Champion Feat

You can now cast *counter-magic* twice per battle.

##### Epic Feat

You can now cast *counter-magic* in reaction to a creature using any magical ability, not just casting a spell.

#### Polysyllabic Verbalizations

Rename each of your daily and recharge spells. Think up the most over-the-top and extravagant names you can muster. Since these alternate spells are so lengthy, they take an additional quick action to cast. While the regular effects of the spells are the same as the more common versions, they have a small bonus effect appropriate to the situation.

The bonus effect is determined by the GM, or by a collaboration between the GM and the player. It should add to the storytelling power of the situation.

The bonus effect should suit the name of the spell or the way it’s delivered, and shouldn’t precisely match up with what the spell normally accomplishes.

#### Wizard’s Familiar

Your familiar is a tiny or small animal or creature that aids your magic and provides companionship. It also provides opportunities for improvisation between you and the GM.

Your familiar is as intelligent as a normal person. It can communicate with you and will stay close you unless you’ve chosen abilities that let it roam. Your familiar is on your side but it’s not perfectly in your control.

If your familiar dies, it can come back to you the next time you get a full heal-up. (The method or story used is between you and the GM.) Alternatively, you can get a new familiar.

Familiars are useless in combat, except as indicated by their abilities. Ordinarily they aren’t damaged by enemy attacks and spells unless the story calls for it.

##### Familiar Abilities

Choose two of the following abilities for your familiar.

###### Agile

You gain a +2 bonus to Dexterity skill checks.

###### Alert, Maybe Even Insightful

You gain a +2 bonus to Wisdom skill checks.

###### Counter-bite

Each battle, if your familiar is close to you, it bites the first enemy that hits you with a melee attack after that attack, dealing `dice: 1d4` damage per level (no attack roll) to that enemy.

###### Flight

Your familiar flies as well as a hawk. It doesn’t fly that often and usually sticks with you, but it can do so when its other abilities allow.

###### Mimic

One battle per day, you gain the use of the racial power (without feats) of one nearby ally.

###### Poisonous

Once per battle, when you hit an enemy engaged with you, you can add 5 ongoing poison damage per tier to the damage roll.

###### Scout

Once per day, your familiar can separate itself from you and make a reconnaissance run of an area or location. Roll an easy skill check for the environment to get your familiar to scout unseen.

###### Tough

You gain a +1 save bonus. Tough counts as two familiar abilities.

###### Talkative

Your familiar can talk like a person (but the GM speaks for the familiar more than you do).

##### Feat Tiers

###### Adventurer Feat

Your familiar gains another ability.

###### Champion Feat

Once per level, if your familiar is close to you, it can cast one of your spells as a free action on your initiative count, even if you have already expended the spell. The spell functions as if you had cast it.

###### Epic Feat

Your familiar gains another ability.

### Cantrips

#### Alarm (standard duration)

The cantrip creates a minor watch-sprite that can be instructed to scream if someone comes through an area or touches an object. Watch-sprites are notoriously stupid and sleepy, but with the right talking-to they might stay focused for the duration of the spell. At higher levels, the spell might summon little fanged spirits buzzing back and forth serving as both visual and actual deterrents.

#### Arcane Mark (standard duration)

The cantrip creates a magical sigil on an object or person. These sigils are usually plain to see, though a deliberately invisible mark can be made. It takes a difficult perception or magic check to notice.

#### Ghost Sound

This spell creates false noises emanating from somewhere nearby. The effect is like an exceptionally good version of throwing your voice, if your voice could create a wide variety of sounds. Attempted distractions with the cantrip are DC 15 challenges in adventurer environments, higher as you move into champion and epic environments. If someone is using ghost sound against the PCs, a Wisdom-based skill check can identify the sound as a magical fake.

#### Knock

This cantrip summons a magical servitor three to four times as big as your closed fist that swarms around the door and attempts to punch or push it open (depending on whether you want to be quiet or announce your presence). Success is determined with an Intelligence check against the environment’s DC using an appropriate magical background. This cantrip does nothing to avoid any traps that might exist.

#### Light (standard duration)

This cantrip creates a fairly wide and consistent field of light, up to 30 feet in diameter, though it isn’t bright enough to dazzle.

#### Mage Hand

This cantrip creates a small telekinetic effect that lasts a round at most. At best it’s about half as strong as the wizard’s own strongest hand. At worst it’s half as strong as the wizard when they’re weak from a bad fever.

#### Mending

This cantrip summons a variety of tiny (hand-sized and smaller) magical sprites who swarm over a chosen broken object attempting to mend it (over the course of 1–6 rounds). Small-scale repairs like torn wineskins, muddy clothing, a broken handgrip on a sword, and similar repairs that anyone could fix with two to four hours of devoted work gets handled in seconds. More elaborate repairs to complicated objects might require an Intelligence check, or at the GM’s discretion could only be possible if the wizard has taken the Cantrip Mastery talent.

#### Prestidigitation

This cantrip produces magic tricks and small illusions. One casting usually gives you a minute of fun. The magic has nowhere near as much real world force as mage hand.

#### Spark

This is a minor fire creation spell, enough to light a pipe, or a campfire, or even a page or two of an unprotected spellbook. It doesn’t work against living beings or against things that couldn’t easily be set on fire with a few seconds of steady application of a candle. The target of the spark has to be nearby and in sight.

### Utility Spell

When you choose spells during a full heal-up, instead of taking a standard spell, you can choose to give up a spell slot to memorize the *utility spell* at the same level. When you take the *utility spell*, you gain access to a range of useful non-combat spells of the level you memorized it or below. You cast each *utility spell* at the level of the spell slot you gave up for it. You can give up multiple spell slots to take *utility spell* multiple times.

Choose from among the following utility spells:

| Spell Level | Spell  |
|-------------|-----------------|
| 1st level   | disguise self   |
| 1st level   | feather fall    |
| 1st level   | hold portal     |
| 3rd level   | levitate        |
| 3rd level   | message|
| 3rd level   | speak with item |
| 5th level   | water breathing |
| 7th level   | scrying|

#### Feat Tiers

##### Adventurer Feat

Each *utility spell* you take lets you cast two spells from the available options instead of one.

##### Champion Feat

As above, but you can cast three *utility spells* instead of one.

#### 1st Level Utility: Disguise Self

Close-quarters spell

Daily

**Effect:** This spell provides you with an effective magical disguise that lasts about ten minutes, making the skill check to avoid unmasking one step easier: easy if it would have been a normal task, normal if it would have been a hard task, and hard if it would have been a ridiculously hard task. The spell only affects your general appearance, not your size. It can be used to hide your features behind the generic features of another person or race. Using it to impersonate a specific creature makes it less effective as a disguise (-2 to -5 penalty).

3rd level spell: The spell lasts for 1 hour.

5th level spell: The spell also provides smell; +2 bonus to any checks.

7th level spell: The spell also handles correct-sounding vocal patterns and rough mannerisms; +4 bonus to any checks.

9th level spell: You can now target an ally with the spell; you can also now use it on up to two creatures at once.

#### 1st Level Utility: Feather Fall

Close-quarters spell

Daily

Free action to cast

**Effect:** When you cast this spell, it arrests your fall, letting you glide down the ground over a round or two.

3rd level spell: You can now target a nearby ally with the spell.

5th level spell: You can now target up to two nearby creatures with the spell.

7th level spell: You can now target up to five nearby creatures with the spell.

9th level spell: You gain some control over where a target falls, like a quickly gliding feather.

#### 1st Level Utility: Hold Portal

Ranged spell

Daily

**Effect:** You cast this spell on a door. For ten minutes, adventurer-tier creatures can’t get through the door. Champion-tier creatures can batter it down; each attempt requires a DC 20 Intelligence skill check (including an applicable background) by the caster to resist the battering and keep the spell going. Epic-tier creatures can walk right through.

3rd level spell: The spell now lasts for an hour. Adventurer-tier creatures are stymied. Champion-tier creatures can batter the door down or destroy it after three failed DC 20 skill checks by the spellcaster. Epic creatures notice that the now-busted door had magic on it.

5th level spell: Champion-tier creatures take a few minutes to force the door open. Epic creatures can force it open after one failed DC 25 skill check by the spellcaster.

7th level spell: Champion-tier creatures are stymied for up to an hour by the door. Epic tier creatures get through after three failed DC 25 skill checks by the spellcaster.

9th level spell: Champion-tier creatures can’t enter. Epic-tier creatures can’t get through for an hour.

#### 3rd Level Utility: Levitate

Ranged spell

Daily

**Effect:** Until the end of the battle, you can use a move action to rise straight up into the air or descend straight down. The spell itself won’t move you horizontally. The up-or-down movement is about half as fast as your normal movement. While levitating, you take a –2 penalty to your attacks and are vulnerable to attacks against you.

5th level spell: You can now cast the spell on a nearby willing ally instead of yourself.

7th level spell: You can now cast the spell as a quick action, and the spell can now affect two targets.

9th level spell: The spell can now affect five targets.

#### 3rd Level Utility: Message

Close-quarters spell

Daily

Quick action to cast

**Effect:** You send a one to two sentence message to another person you know and have touched in the last week. Sending a message to a person you can see is always easy. Sending a message to a person you can’t see requires a skill check using Intelligence against the highest-tier environment that you or the sender are occupying.

The maximum distance you can send a message depends on the spell’s level.

3rd level spell: Across half a city, at most.

5th level spell: Across the entire city and a bit into the countryside.

7th level spell: Between cities near to each other.

9th level spell: From any city to any other city, or across a sea.

#### 3rd Level Utility: Speak with Item

Close-quarters spell

Daily

Quick action to cast

**Effect:** Speak briefly, mind-to-mind, with a magic item you are touching that is owned by you or one of your allies. The item’s owner gets a free power recharge roll if that item’s power has been expended.

5th level spell: You no longer need to be touching the item; it only has to be nearby.

7th level spell: The item’s owner gains a +2 bonus to the item recharge roll.

9th level spell: If the item recharge roll fails, you keep this spell, but the item won’t talk to you until after your next full heal-up.

#### 5th Level Utility: Water Breathing

Close-quarters spell

Daily

Quick action to cast

**Effect:** You can breathe underwater for the rest of the battle (or about five minutes). You become aware a couple of rounds ahead of when the magic of the spell is about to end.

7th level spell: You and `dice: 1d4` + 2 nearby allies can breathe underwater this battle.

9th level spell: The spell affects you and `dice: 1d6` + 2 nearby allies for `dice: 4d6`hours.

#### 7th Level Utility: Scrying

Ranged spell

Daily

**Effect:** You can use this spell to get information you shouldn’t be able to get, peering in on other people’s lives for a short period of time, usually no more than ten minutes at a time. Some areas may be warded at the GM’s discretion. You must have touched the person you wish to spy on in the last month, or, at 9th level, within the last a year.

Scrying as a single standard action won’t yield much. Concentrating on the spell for a while with props like a scrying pool or a crystal ball will work better.

### 1st Level Spells

#### Acid Arrow

Ranged spell

Daily

**Target:** One nearby or faraway creature

**Attack:** Intelligence + Level vs. PD

**Hit:** `dice: 4d10` acid damage, and 5 ongoing acid damage.

**Miss:** 5 ongoing acid damage, and you regain the spell during your next quick rest.

3rd level spell: `dice: 5d10`damage, and 10 ongoing damage; 10 ongoing on a miss.

5th level spell: `dice: 8d10`damage, and 15 ongoing damage; 15 ongoing on a miss.

7th level spell: `dice: 3d4*10` damage, and 25 ongoing damage; 25 ongoing on a miss.

9th level spell: `dice: 5d4*10` damage, and 40 ongoing damage; 40 ongoing on a miss.

#### Blur

Ranged spell

Daily

**Target:** You or one nearby ally

**Effect:** For the rest of the battle (or for five minutes), attacks against the target miss 20% of the time.

3rd level spell: The spell is now a quick action to cast.

5th level spell: Miss 25% of the time.

7th level spell: Miss 30% of the time, and you can now target `dice: 1d2` creatures with the spell.

9th level spell: Miss 30% of the time, and you can now target two creatures with the spell.

#### Charm Person

Ranged spell

Daily

**Target:** One nearby creature with 40 hp or fewer

**Special:** This spell cannot be cast during combat or on a target that has rolled initiative to fight.

**Attack:** Intelligence + Level vs. MD

**Hit:** The target believes you are their friend until you or your allies take hostile action against them. (Attacking their normal allies is okay.) If you or your allies attack the target or order the target to attack its normal allies, the target can roll a normal save to break the charm effect during its turn each round.

**Special:** On a miss, the spell is not detectible by most others unless you miss by 4+ or roll a natural 1, in which case the target and its allies knows what you tried to do and will usually be angry about it.

3rd level spell: Target with 64 hp or fewer.

5th level spell: Target with 96 hp or fewer.

7th level spell: Target with 160 hp or fewer.

9th level spell: Target with 266 hp or fewer.

#### Color Spray

Close-quarters spell

Cyclic (cast once per battle OR at-will when the escalation die is even)

**Target:** `dice: 1d4` nearby enemies in a group

**Attack:** Intelligence + Level vs. MD

**Hit:** `dice: 2d8` psychic damage, and if the target has 10 hp or fewer after the damage, it is weakened until the end of your next turn.

3rd level spell: `dice: 4d6`damage, 20 hp or fewer.

5th level spell: `dice: 6d8` damage, 30 hp or fewer.

7th level spell: `dice: 10d6` damage, 40 hp or fewer.

##### Adventurer Feat

Increase the hit point threshold of the weakened effect by 5 hp.

##### Champion Feat

On a miss, the spell deals damage equal to your level.

##### Epic Feat

The spell now targets `dice: 1d4` + 1 nearby enemies in a group.

**Effect:** `dice: 2d4` force damage.

3rd level spell: `dice: 2d8` damage.

5th level spell: `dice: 4d6`damage.

7th level spell: `dice: 6d6`damage.

9th level spell: `dice: 10d6` damage.

##### Adventurer Feat

You can choose two targets; roll half the damage dice for one missile and half the damage dice for the other, then assign one set of damage dice to each of the two targets.

##### Champion Feat

Roll a d20 when you use the spell; if you roll a natural 20, the magic missile crits and deals double damage. (Rolling a 1 is not a fumble; this roll checks only to see if you can crit.)

##### Epic Feat

The 7th and 9th level versions of the spell now use d8s as damage dice.

#### Ray of Frost

Ranged spell

At-Will

**Target:** One nearby enemy

**Attack:** Intelligence + Level vs. PD

##### Adventurer Feat

When your *ray of frost* attack roll is a natural even hit, if the target is staggered after taking the damage, it is also dazed until the end of your next turn.

##### Champion Feat

The target of the spell can also be faraway.

##### Epic Feat

When you cast the spell you can change the damage type to lightning or negative energy.

#### Shield

Close-quarters spell

Recharge 11+ after battle

Free action to cast, when an attack hits your AC.

**Effect:** The attacker must reroll the attack. You must accept the new result.

3rd level spell: You gain a +2 AC bonus against the rerolled attack.

5th level spell: You can also use the spell against attacks that target your Physical Defense; replace references to AC with PD.

7th level spell: The bonus to AC/PD on the rerolled attack increases to +4.

Any effects of spells or items cast before teleporting are dispelled and no longer function on arrival.
