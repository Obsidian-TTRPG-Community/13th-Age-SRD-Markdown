> [!13A-Spell] Unsummoning  
> 7th level+  
> Ranged spell ◆ **Daily**  
> **Target**: One nearby non-undead enemy that the GM hasn’t given a proper name, or that doesn’t play a key role in the current storyline  
> **Attack**: Charisma + Level vs. MD  
> **Hit**: The target is sent elsewhere, possibly to a location that’s close enough for the PCs to have to deal with it in a subsequent battle. It might also go somewhere “interesting.”
> Replace the target with the GM’s choice of an undamaged and hostile undead creature that is one level lower than the original target. If the target was a large or double-strength creature, the replacement must be large or double-strength, or perhaps two normal undead instead of one show up. Ditto for huge/triple-strength targets. Therefore you’re only slightly reducing the raw power of the opposition; the advantage of using the spell is that you’re getting rid of an enemy you match up badly against and dropping the level of the opposition by one. The disadvantage, of course, is that you’ll probably have to face that enemy again.
> **Miss**: `dice: 7d10` + Charisma psychic damage.
>
> - 9th level spell: `dice: 8d10` + Charisma psychic damage on a miss.
>
> ### Champion Feat
> This spell can now also target an entire mob of mooks. If the attack hits, replace them with a mob of undead mooks that is one level lower.
>
> ### Epic Feat
> You don’t expend the spell when you miss with it.
