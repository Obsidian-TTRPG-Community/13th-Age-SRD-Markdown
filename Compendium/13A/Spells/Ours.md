> [!13A-Spell] Ours!  
> 1st level+  
> Ranged spell ◆ **Daily**  
> **Target**: One nearby ally  
> **Effect**: The target can heal using a free recovery, adding hit points equal to `dice: 1d6` x the escalation die to that healing. Unless you or the target is a dwarf, randomly choose one of the target’s true magic items. You actively gain that item’s quirk until the end of the day.
