The ThreeÂ were among the first dragons to walk the world. The Red is a living engine of destruction. The Blue is a sorceress, perhaps even the original mother of all sorcery. The Black is queen of shadows and assassins. Unlike the [[Compendium/13A/Icons/Great-Gold-Wyrm|Great Gold Wyrm]], who must fight alone, the Three have learned to join forces.
