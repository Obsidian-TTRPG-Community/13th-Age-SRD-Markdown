## Elf Queen

![Elf-Queen|300](Compendium/13A/Icons/Elf-Queen-image-1.jpg)

>[!info] The Elf Queen
> The **Elf Queen** rules the Court of Stars, the one place where wood elves, dark elves, and high elves come together as peers and [[Compendium/13A/Combat-Rules/Combat-Actions/Movement-and-Melee/Special-Cases/Allies|allies]] instead of as rivals or enemies. Honed by centuries of experience, the Queen’s innate magic at least equals the Archmage’s spells.
