> [!info] The Diabolist
> The **Diabolist** controls fiends and tampers with forces even the Archmage avoids. She likes her victims screaming and her chaos pure while claiming that the demons she summons would otherwise overwhelm the [[Compendium/13A/Icons/Great-Gold-Wyrm|Great Gold Wyrm]] who seals the Abyss. 
> 
> There are two differences between her and her demons: 
> - First, she likes keeping destruction personal rather than universal.
> - Second, she’s capable of kindness, so long as it comes as a great surprise.
