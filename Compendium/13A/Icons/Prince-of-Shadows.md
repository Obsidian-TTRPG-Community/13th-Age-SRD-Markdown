## Prince of Shadows

![Prince of Shadows|300](Compendium/13A/Icons/Prince-of-Shadows-image-1.jpg)

>[!info] The Prince of Shadows  
> The **Prince of Shadows** is part thief, part trickster, and part assassin. To some he is a hero; to others a villain. He has squandered the riches of the dwarves, murdered the hopes of a dragon, and plundered the dreams of a god. His exploits have changed the world, but none can tell you his ultimate goals or motives.
