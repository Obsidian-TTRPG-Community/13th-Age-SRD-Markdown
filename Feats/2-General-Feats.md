# General Feats

These are general feats available to any character. A character can’t take a specific feat more than once. A few general feats only have adventurer-tier versions; others also have champion- and epic-tier versions that can be added later in your career.

> __13th Age SRD Markdown Note__
> An all-in-one list is maintained here, and the Feats are also kept in individual files in the Box_of_Feats folder for character sheets and other linking purposes if needed. 
> 
> You may delete them if you do not need them. 

## Further Backgrounding

__Adventurer Tier__
Add a total of 2 points to backgrounds you already have, or choose 2 points of new backgrounds that make sense for your character. 

> You still can’t go over the 5-point-per- background maximum.

__Champion Tier__
Add a total of 3 points to backgrounds you already have, or choose 3 points of new backgrounds that make sense for your character. 

> You still can’t go over the 5-point-per- background maximum.

__Epic Tier__
Add a total of 2 points to backgrounds you already have, or choose 2 points of new backgrounds that make sense for your character. 

> These points can take one of your backgrounds over 5, to a maximum of 7.


## Improved Initiative

__Adventurer Tier__

Gain a +4 bonus to Initiative checks.


## Linguist

__Adventurer Tier__

This feat allows you to speak enough arcana, dwarven, elven, gnomish, gnoll, goblin, orcish, and other standard humanoid languages to comprehend enough of what most other humanoids are saying or screaming during battle. 

You are not fluent in all these languages, no one will mistake you for a native speaker, and your vocabulary is adventurer-centric (heavy on words connected to danger rather than philosophy or emotions).

You can also read enough to get by in all these languages.

__Champion Tier__

You can speak, read, and write all the humanoid languages fluently. Stranger languages are no problem for you either. If someone is speaking it, you can figure it out.

## Precise Shot

__Adventurer Tier__

When your ranged attack targets an enemy who is engaged with an ally, you have no chance of hitting that ally.


## Rapid Reload

__Adventurer Tier__

Reloading a heavy crossbow now takes only a quick action. Reloading a hand or light crossbow is a free action.

## Reach Tricks

Once per battle, tell the Game Master (GM) how you are using your weapon’s reach to perform an unexpected stunt with a reach weapon such as a longspear or halberd. 

To use the stunt, you must roll a 6+ on a d20 (`dice: 1d20`)

## Ritual Casting

__Adventurer Tier__

You can cast any spells you know as rituals. Classes that are already ritual casters (cleric, wizard) don’t need this feat. 

(See __Rituals__ for ritual casting rules.)


## Skill Escalation

__Adventurer Tier__ 

Twice per day, you can add the escalation die to one of your skill checks. 

> Choose after you roll the check.

## Strong Recovery

__Adventurer Tier__

When you roll recovery dice, reroll one of the dice and use the higher result. 

At 5th level, reroll two of the dice. 

At 8th level, reroll three.


## Toughness

__Adventurer Tier__

You get additional hit points equal to half your baseline class hit points (rounded down). 

At 5th level, the total hp bonus increases to your baseline hp value. 

At 8th level, the total hp bonus increases to double your baseline hp value.
