The 13th Age Archmage Engine describes the rules of 13th Age, the 13th Age Bestiary, and 13 True Ways that you may incorporate, wholly or in part, into a derivative work.

In short, we’ll describe the rules and mechanics that we use for 13th Age (Open Content), then you can adopt the ones you like and leave the ones you don’t. Just don’t use any intellectual property that is not specifically part of the 13th Age Archmage Engine (Product Identity).
