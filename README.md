# 13th Age System Resource Document Markdown

## Recommended Obsidian.md Plugins
[Alx-Folder-Note](https://github.com/aidenlx/alx-folder-note) and it's framework, [Folder-Note-Core](https://github.com/aidenlx/folder-note-core). 
> This plugin enables your folders to not only hold files, but to become notes themselves. The vault has been to integrate the correct files if you use the plugin, or others which provide this functionality. However, it will be fully functional even without this plugin.


## Kin, not Race
In the current iteration of the 13th Age 2E [playtest documents](https://robheinsoo.blogspot.com/2022/08/13th-age-2e-more-info.html), Race has been changed out with Kin. In order to conform with this terminology, all instances of the word "Race" within the SRD have been changed to "Kin". Grammar may have been adjusted to account for this changed, and have been logged accordingly within the [Changelog](SRD-MD_Changelog.md)
