# 13th Age SRD Markdown

You did not ask for it, but here it is. The **[13th Age](https://pelgranepress.com/13th-age/)** System Resource Document now in Markdown and **[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)** ready.

> Note: This Vault is Still in Progress and expected completion date is 05/31/2023.


## Obsidian Plugins

This vault is designed to work with the following plugins:

> **[Alx-Folder-Note](https://github.com/aidenlx/alx-folder-note)** and its framework, **[Folder-Note-Core](https://github.com/aidenlx/folder-note-core).** 
> Alternatively, install [Obsidian Folder Notes](https://github.com/LostPaul/obsidian-folder-notes) which is now available on the community plugins list.
 These plugins enable your folders to not only hold files, but to become notes themselves. The vault is customized to integrate the correct files if you use these plugins. 
 It is fully functional even without them.


> **[Dice Roller](https://github.com/valentine195/obsidian-dice-roller)**
 This plugin turns dice syntax inside Obsidian into rolled results. 
**Example**: d10 (dice: d10) can render into d10 (1d10 -> [3] -> 3)
The vault has been set up to show the results of any d20 if Dice Roller is installed. 
It will also include instructions of how to remove those references if it isn't needed. 

> **[Fantasy Statblocks](https://github.com/javalent/fantasy-statblocks)**
This plugin makes statblocks go from simple tables, to fabulous interactive codeblocks. Check out the 13th Age Layout [included within the Plugin](https://plugins.javalent.com/statblock/layouts/integrated/13a-monster#Create+Stats+Table).
