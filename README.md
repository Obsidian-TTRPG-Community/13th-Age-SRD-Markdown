## Recommended Obsidian Plugins

**[Alx-Folder-Note](https://github.com/aidenlx/alx-folder-note)** and it's framework, **[Folder-Note-Core](https://github.com/aidenlx/folder-note-core).** 
> This plugin enables your folders to not only hold files, but to become notes themselves. The vault has been customized to integrate the correct files if you use the plugin, or others which provide this functionality. However, it will be fully functional even without this plugin.
> 

**[Dice Roller](https://github.com/valentine195/obsidian-dice-roller)**
> This plugin turns dice syntax inside Obsidian into rolled results. 
> **Example**: d10 (dice: d10) can render into d10 (1d10 -> [3] -> 3)
> The vault has been set up to show the results of any d20 if Dice Roller is installed. It will also include instructions of how to remove those references if it is not needed.
