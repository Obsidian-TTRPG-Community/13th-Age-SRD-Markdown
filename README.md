## Quick Start

3. Explore!


### Obsidian Plugins

#### Required

**[Fantasy Statblocks](https://github.com/javalent/fantasy-statblocks)**  
This plugin makes statblocks go from simple tables in the SRD, to fabulous interactive codeblocks. 
Check out the 13th Age Layout **[included within the Plugin](https://plugins.javalent.com/statblock/layouts/integrated/13a-monster)**.

#### Optional

We have designed this vault to work with the following plugins:

**[Alx-Folder-Note](https://github.com/aidenlx/alx-folder-note)** or **[Obsidian Folder Notes](https://github.com/LostPaul/obsidian-folder-notes)**  
These plugins enable your folders to not only hold files, but to become notes themselves.
The vault will integrate the correct files if you use these plugins. It is fully functional even without them.

**[Dice Roller](https://github.com/valentine195/obsidian-dice-roller)**  
This plugin turns dice syntax inside Obsidian into rolled results. 
The vault will show the results of any d20 if installed.
**Example**: d10 `dice: d10` will render into `d10 (1d10 -> [3] -> 3)`

**[Initiative Tracker](https://github.com/javalent/initiative-tracker)**
This plugin takes the data from Fantasy Statblocks and not only allows an initiative tracker with those entities,
but integrates with the built-in encounter builder.

## After the SRD

This vault is meant to be a download and gp vault, but what if you wanted to expand upon it?
Here are some suggested avenues:

- **More Monsters**: Need to add monsters from your PDF files to Fantasy Statblocks? Use the **[Obsidian 13A Parser](https://github.com/freohr/obsidian-13A-monster-parser)**.
- **13 Vaults**: Looking for additional third-party resources, or materials that we do not yet or will not host within this vault? Take a look at the **[13 Vaults Repo](https://github.com/13vaults/13vaults.com)** and **[www.13vaults.com](https://www.13vaults.com)**.
- **PDF Text Extraction**: Either **[Text Extractor](https://github.com/scambier/obsidian-text-extractor)** or **[Text Format](https://github.com/Benature/obsidian-text-format)** make taking text from PDF's to Obsidian much, much easier.
