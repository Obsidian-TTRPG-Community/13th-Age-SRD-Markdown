### Kin, not Race
In the current iteration of the 13th Age 2E [playtest documents](https://robheinsoo.blogspot.com/2022/08/13th-age-2e-more-info.html), Race has been changed out with Kin. In order to conform with this terminology, all instances of the word "Race" within the SRD have been changed to "Kin". Grammar may have been adjusted to account for this changed, and have been logged accordingly within the [Changelog](Changelog.md).
