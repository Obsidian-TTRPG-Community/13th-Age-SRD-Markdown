## 13th Age SRD Markdown

You did not ask for it, but here it is. The **[13th Age](https://pelgranepress.com/13th-age/)** System Resource Document now in Markdown and **[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)** ready.

**Note**: This Vault is Still in Progress and expected completion date is 05/31/2023.

### Obsidian Plugins

#### Required

**[Fantasy Statblocks](https://github.com/javalent/fantasy-statblocks)**  
This plugin makes statblocks go from simple tables in the SRD, to fabulous interactive codeblocks. Check out the 13th Age Layout [included within the Plugin](https://plugins.javalent.com/statblock/layouts/integrated/13a-monster#Create+Stats+Table). 

*In order to prevent filling the vault with many, many HTML Tables, this plugin is required.*

#### Optional

This vault is also designed to work with the following plugins:

**[Alx-Folder-Note](https://github.com/aidenlx/alx-folder-note)** or **[Obsidian Folder Notes](https://github.com/LostPaul/obsidian-folder-notes)**  
These plugins enable your folders to not only hold files, but to become notes themselves. The vault is customised to integrate the correct files if you use these plugins. It is fully functional even without them.

**[Dice Roller](https://github.com/valentine195/obsidian-dice-roller)**  
This plugin turns dice syntax inside Obsidian into rolled results.  
**Example**: d10 `dice: d10` can render into `d10 (1d10 -> [3] -> 3)`
- The vault has been set up to show the results of any d20 if Dice  
Roller is installed.
