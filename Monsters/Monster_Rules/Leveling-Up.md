# Leveling up

Use these guidelines to raise an existing monster by one or more levels.

1. Raise its attack bonuses and defenses by 1 per added level.
2. For damage, hp, and related special abilities (like healing), multiply the monsterâ€™s stats accordingly:

| __Levels Added__ | __Damage Multiplier__ |
|---|---|
| +1 level | x 1.25 |
| +2 levels | x 1.6 |
| +3 levels | x 2.0 |
| +4 levels | x 2.5 |
| +5 levels | x 3.2 |
| +6 levels | x 4.0 |
