# Monster Key

## Size/Strength and Level
These are the key stats that determine how tough a battle will be using the creature. Sizes are regular, large, and huge. 
Regular-sized monster can have double-strength (2x) and triple-strength (3x). 
Regular-sized and regular-strength monsters are labeled as normal.

## Role
Monsters with different roles still use the same stats.

### Archers
Archers are ranged attackers who use weapons rather than spells.

### Blockers
Blockers have abilities that help them protect their allies.

### Casters
Casters are magician-types who need space to cast their spells properly. They’re capable of anything.

### Leaders
Leaders have abilities that help other monster allies fight better.

### Mooks
Mooks are minor monsters that are good cannon fodder. (See Mooks.)

### Spoilers
Spoilers mess the PCs up with attacks that inflict harmful effects instead of or in addition to hit point damage.

### Troops
Troops are the default monster type that aim to hurt PCs via hit point damage.

### Wreckers
Wreckers really bring the pain. Enemy groups containing only wreckers will be very dangerous to the PCs.

## Type
Some spells and magic items care about monster type. A ranger with a favored enemy type definitely cares about it.

Types include aberration, beast, construct, demon, dragon, giant, humanoid, ooze, and undead.

## Initiative, AC, PD, MD, HP
See Combat Stats.

## Attack
The default attack is a melee attack against one target that requires a standard action to use. If an attack can target more than one creature, that information follows the attack value.

When a monster makes an opportunity attack, it must use a melee attack. If that attack action normally includes multiple attacks, it can make only one attack roll.

**The abbreviation R**: indicates that an attack is a ranged attack instead of a melee attack. The default ranged attack assumes a single nearby target, but some can hit far away targets as well, which is noted in the targeting information or extra effect trigger.

**The abbreviation C**: refers to close-quarters attacks that can be used without triggering opportunity attacks from engaged enemies like ranged attacks do. Each close-quarters attack will note its targets.

Some attacks can only be used when the natural roll triggers it. These attacks have a [Special trigger] indicator at the start of the attack line. Other triggers allow a monster to use a normal standard action attack as a free action.

## Extra Effect Trigger
Many monster abilities trigger randomly based on the monster’s attack roll. Not all attacks have triggers. Most extra effect triggers are natural even or odd attack rolls or other specific die rolls, but a few are more unusual.

## Specials
These are other attacks and special abilities like fear or movement abilities like flight. Not all monsters have them.

Some monsters have nastier special abilities that increase a monster’s options and help keep monsters interesting throughout the campaign. Use them as options whenever you like.
