Most monster attacks generally deal a specific amount of damage (instead of rolling for damage) and donâ€™t add on the escalation die. Only exceptional [monsters](../Monsters.md) get to add the escalation die to their attacks.

Monsters may have particular [abilities](../../Character-Rules/Abilities.md) or powers that are triggered when the attack roll is greater than a certain threshold. The default trigger happens at a 16+ monster d20 attack roll, though unpredictable monsters may have effects trigger on other rolls.
