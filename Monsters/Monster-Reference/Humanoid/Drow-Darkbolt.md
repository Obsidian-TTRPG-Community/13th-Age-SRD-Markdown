<p><strong>R: Exsanguinating barbed arrows +12 vs. AC (one nearby or
faraway enemy)</strong>—20 damage, and 6 ongoing damage</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit:</em> As a free action, the darkbolt can make a
second <em>barbed arrows</em> attack against a different enemy with a –2
attack penalty. If it gets another natural even hit, it can make a third
(and final) <em>barbed arrows</em> attack against a different enemy with
a –4 attack penalty as a free action.</p>
<p><em>Darkbolt vanish!:</em> If unengaged, when the darkbolt attacks
and rolls a natural even miss, it can step into a shadow-dimension that
turn as a move action. While in the shadows, it can’t be seen or
targeted with attacks, and it reappears anywhere nearby at the start of
its next turn.</p>
<p><em>Wall-crawler:</em> A darkbolt can climb on ceilings and walls as
easily as it moves on the ground thanks to its rope-dagger and spiked
bracers.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p><em>Well equipped:</em> The drow has a potion or poison that it can
use as a quick action twice this battle (see Drow Abilities).</p></td>
