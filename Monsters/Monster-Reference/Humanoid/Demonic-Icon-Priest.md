<p><strong>Spectral dagger +8 vs. AC</strong>—10 damage</p>
<p><em>Natural 16+ hit:</em> One nearby ally gains a +4 bonus to hit on
its next attack.</p>
<p><strong>C: Liturgy of the Abyss +8 vs. MD (1d3 nearby
enemies)</strong>—12 damage</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit:</em> All nearby allies get a +1 AC bonus
(cumulative!) until the Demonic Icon priest drops to 0 hit points.</p>
<p><em>Limited use:</em> Every use of <em>liturgy of the Abyss</em>
reduces one random nearby Demonic Icon fanatic to 0 hp. If there are no
Demonic Icon fanatics nearby, the Demonic Icon priest cannot use
<em>liturgy of the Abyss</em>.</p>
<p><strong>R: Kill the soul +8 vs. MD (one nearby enemy)</strong>—10
damage. If an ally is engaged with the target, it can make a basic
attack against the target as a free action</p>
<p><em>The Demonic Icon’s mercy:</em> Once per battle as a standard
action, the Demonic Icon priest can heal a nearby ally or enemy for 40
hit points; the target also regains the use of one expended daily or
once-per-battle ability.</p>
<p>If the target of <em>the Demonic Icon’s mercy</em> is a player
character or other enemy, the target chooses whether to accept this
mercy; if not, the ability has no effect. A PC who accepts mercy and who
has a negative relationship with the Demonic Icon, it becomes
conflicted; if the relationship is conflicted, it becomes positive. If
the PC does not have an icon relationship with the Demonic Icon, the
character must shift one relationship point with another icon into a
conflicted relationship with the Demonic Icon.</p>
<p><em>Ye called in Their name, and I came hither:</em> As a standard
action, a player character in the Demonic Icon cult area (or some other
evil marsh or cursed area!) who has a 5 or 6 icon advantage with the
Demonic Icon can spend it to summon a Demonic Icon priest to their
location. The Demonic Icon priest teleports next to the summoner, and
acts on the turn immediately after the summoner’s to perform <em>the
Demonic Icon’s mercy</em> on the summoner or a nearby ally. After doing
so, it teleports away.</p>
<p><em>Limited use:</em> Once per campaign for all Demonic Icon priests
after the player characters’ first battle against a Demonic Icon priest.
And if used on a character who already has a positive relationship with
the Demonic Icon, the PC gets another such point, replacing one of their
other icon relationships.</p></td>
