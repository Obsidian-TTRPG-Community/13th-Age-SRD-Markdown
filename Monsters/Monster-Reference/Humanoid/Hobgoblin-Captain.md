<p><em>Willing-underling:</em> Until the start of its next turn, the
first time an attack would hit the hobgoblin captain, it can partially
avoid that attack if it has a nearby goblin ally. It only takes half
damage from the attack, and that ally takes the rest.</p>
<p><strong>R: Throwing axe +8 vs. AC</strong>—10 damage</p>
<p><em>Group ability:</em> For every two hobgoblins in the battle (round
up, ignore mooks), one of them can use <em>well-armored</em> as a free
action once during the battle.</p>
<p><em>Well-armored (group):</em> Ignore all damage from a hit (but not
a crit) against AC.</p></td>
