<p><strong>Half-hearted stab +8 vs. AC</strong>—8 damage</p>
<p><strong>R: Accursed bolt +9 vs. PD (one nearby or faraway
enemy)</strong>—12 lightning damage</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit:</em> The Demonic Icon wizard can make an
<em>accursed bolt</em> attack against a second nearby enemy, followed by
a third and final different nearby enemy if the second attack is also a
natural even hit.</p>
<p><em>Natural odd hit:</em> The Demonic Icon wizard can make an
<em>abyssal curse</em> attack as a free action.</p>
<p><em>[Special trigger]</em> <strong>Abyssal curse +9 vs. MD (creature
hit by a natural odd <em>abyssal bolt</em>)</strong>—The target is
weakened until the end of its next turn.</p>
<p><strong>R: Hellfireball +9 vs. PD (1d3 nearby enemies in a group and
any allies engaged with those enemies)</strong>—18 fire damage</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> Half damage.</p>
<p><em>Natural 16+ hit:</em> 7 psychic damage.</p>
<p><em>Limited use:</em> 1/ battle, and generally after trying to
corrupt at least one icon relationship.</p>
<p><strong>C: Corrupting grasp +9 vs. PD</strong>—12 negative damage,
and the target pops free.</p>
<p><em>Natural 16+ hit:</em> The target is dazed until the end of its
next turn.</p>
<p><em>The Demonic Icon’s knowledge:</em> Once per day, the Demonic Icon
wizard can offer to answer truthfully one question about the adventure,
with knowledge drawn from the Demonic Icon or their spells rather than
from the wizard. If the questioner has a negative relationship with the
Demonic Icon, it becomes conflicted; if the relationship is conflicted,
it becomes positive. If the PC does not have an icon relationship with
the Demonic Icon, the character must shift one relationship point with
another icon into a conflicted or positive relationship with the Demonic
Icon.</p>
<p><em>The Demonic Icon’s blessing:</em> Once per battle as a standard
action, the Demonic Icon wizard can grant one nearby player character a
random demon-style power from the table below. The blessing only takes
effect if the character accepts it, but the character can choose to
accept the blessing at any point this day, in this or another battle. If
the blessing is accepted, <em>the Demonic Icon’s blessing</em> affects
the target’s icon relationships the same as <em>the Demonic Icon’s
knowledge</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Random Demon-Style Power (d4)</strong></p>
<p><em>1. Resist energy 16+</em>—When an attack that deals energy damage
targets you, the attacker must roll a natural 16+ on the attack roll or
it only deals half damage.</p>
<p><em>2. Fear aura</em>—Enemies engaged with you that have fewer hit
points than double your current hit points are dazed. If they could
normally use the escalation die, now they can’t.</p>
<p><em>3. Demonic speed</em>—You can take an extra standard action each
turn that the escalation die is even. You lose 2d6 hit points each time
you use the extra action.</p>
<p><em>4. Teleport 1d3 + 1 times this battle</em>—As a move action, you
can teleport anywhere you can see nearby.</p>
<p><em>Ye called in Their name, and I came hither:</em> As a standard
action, a player character in the Demonic Icon cult area (or some other
evil marsh or cursed area!) who has a 5 or 6 icon advantage with the
Demonic Icon can spend it to summon a Demonic Icon wizard to their
location. The Demonic Icon wizard teleports next to the summoner, and
acts on the turn immediately after the summoner’s to either answer a
question with the Demonic Icon’s knowledge or perform <em>the Demonic
Icon’s blessing</em> on a nearby ally. After doing so, it teleports
away.</p>
<p><em>Limited use:</em> Once per campaign for all Demonic Icon wizards
after the PC’s first battle against a Demonic Icon wizard. If used on a
character who already has a positive relationship with the Demonic Icon,
the PC gets another such point, replacing one of their other icon
relationships.</p></td>
