<p><em>Natural 16+:</em> Each other glinter in the battle gains a +1
attack bonus (cumulative) until the end of the turn.</p>
<p><strong>R: Stick-launched dart +10 vs. AC</strong>—9 damage</p>
<p><em>Limited use:</em> A mob of glinters can use this attack only once
during the battle. On the turn that they use the attack, each glinter in
the mob can choose whether to make the attack or not. Any who don’t use
it, lose it.</p>
<p><em>Home turf tricks:</em> The first time each enemy in a battle
attacks a glinter mob, it must roll a save; on a failure, that attack is
negated. The glinters have traps, hidden weapons, trick furniture, and
other resources that they can use against attackers. Improvise some
trick, ideally involving scorpions, that either protects the kobolds
from the attack or interferes with the attacker, assuming the glinters
are on familiar ground.</p>
<p><em>Stubborn resilience:</em> Whenever three or more glinters drop
from a single attack (possibly involving multiple attack rolls),
one-third of those glinters are undamaged instead (round down).</p>
<p><em>Free-form ability—Unstoppability:</em> Glinters can pour through
small openings in large numbers, crowd into tight spaces, scramble over
or through obstacles, and otherwise get into places faster than you
would believe. This trait helps them overwhelm enemies with numbers that
the unfortunate targets don’t believes is possible.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p><em>Bitter resolve:</em> When a glinter mob is reduced to half its
number or less, the surviving glinters gain a +4 bonus to all defenses
until the end of the battle.</p>
<p><em>Coordinated strike:</em> Once per battle as a free action, the
glinter mob can utter a war cry in unison and each member of the mob
gains a +4 attack bonus that turn.</p></td>

## Kohwa

<u>Abilities for all kohwa</u>

*Flight:* Kohwa are winged, and therefore capable of flight. While they  
are strong fliers and able to travel great distances in this way, they  
are acutely aware of how ungainly they look while doing so, and  
therefore prefer to walk or run unless they are certain no one is  
watching.

*Swimming:* Unlike many cat species, kohwa are perfectly at home in the  
water, so diving into a lake or river is a poor defense against them.

*Telepathy:* Kohwa are capable of short-range telepathy with non-kohwa.  
It is assumed (although no one is entirely sure) that they are capable  
of communicating with others of their species at greater distances, as  
when one is in trouble, others are sure to appear—eventually.
