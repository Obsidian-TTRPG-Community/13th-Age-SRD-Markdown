<p><strong>Palm strike +10 vs. PD</strong>—10 damage, and 10 ongoing
poison damage</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> 5 damage.</p>
<p><strong>R: Royal blessing +10 vs. MD</strong>—15 negative energy
damage, and if one or more Woven have been slain this battle, return one
Woven to life in the location where it died</p>
<p><em>Limited use:</em> The swarm prince can use this ability only when
the escalation die is even.</p>
<p><strong>C: Hush my darling +10 vs. MD (the nearby conscious enemy
with the fewest hit points)</strong>—5 psychic damage, and the target is
unconscious (hard save ends, 16+; it also ends if the target takes 15
damage)</p>
<p><em>Limited use:</em> 1/battle, and the ability recharges when the
swarm prince hits with <em>palm strike</em>.</p>
<p><em>Surrounded by friends:</em> The swarm prince gains a +1 bonus to
all defenses for each nearby Woven.</p>
<p><em>Give me your heart:</em> When the prince drops an enemy to 0 hit
points or lower, he will move next to that creature and attempt to
remove the target’s heart. The creature must begin making last gasp
saves as he cuts their chest open. On the fourth failure, the prince
takes the heart and the target dies and becomes undead under his
control. If the prince is stunned or moved away from the creature and
can’t return to it on his turn, the creature doesn’t have to make a last
gasp save that turn.</p></td>
