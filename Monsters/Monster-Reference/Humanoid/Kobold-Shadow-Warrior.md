<p><em>Elusive:</em> If a shadow-warrior hasn’t been attacked since the
end of its last turn, it can spend all of its actions on its turn to
disappear from sight (remove it from play as it gets into position). At
the start of its next turn, it reappears (dropping down from the ceiling
or springing out of cover and re-entering play) and can make an
<em>elusive strike</em> attack as a standard action.</p>
<p><strong>C: Elusive strike +13 vs. AC (one nearby
creature)</strong>—18 damage</p>
<p><em>Evasive:</em> Kobolds take no damage from missed attacks.</p>
<p><em>Wall-crawler:</em> A kobold shadow-warrior can climb on ceilings
and walls as easily as it moves on the ground.</p></td>
