<p><strong>Naginata +13 vs. AC</strong>—35 damage</p>
<p><em>Natural 18+:</em> Make a second <em>naginata</em> attack against
a nearby enemy as a free action (engaging it is not required).</p>
<p><strong>C: Cone of cold +13 vs. PD (up to 3 nearby enemies in a
group)</strong>—50 cold damage</p>
<p><em>Limited use:</em> 1/day, and the attack affects the ogre’s allies
engaged with or between enemy targets.</p>
<p><em>Aura of treachery:</em> Once per round when a nearby enemy misses
the ogre mage with an attack, the ogre mage can make an <em>aura of
treachery</em> attack against it as a free action.</p>
<p><em>[Special trigger]</em> <strong>C: Aura of treachery +13 vs.
MD</strong>—The target is confused until the end of the ogre mage’s next
turn</p>
<p><em>Flight:</em> The ogre mage flies using the sheer power of its
superior mind.</p>
<p><em>Invisibility:</em> If the ogre mage is not engaged, it can turn
invisible as an at-will standard action. It becomes visible when it
attacks. The ogre mage takes 1d10 damage each time it uses invisibility
while it’s staggered.</p>
<p><em>Resist exceptional attacks 16+:</em> When a limited attack (not
an at-will attack) targets this creature, the attacker must roll a
natural 16+ on the attack roll or it only deals half damage.</p>
<p>Trollish regeneration 20: While an ogre mage is damaged, its uncanny
flesh heals 20 hit points at the start of the ogre mage’s turn. It can
regenerate five times per battle. If it heals to its maximum hit points,
then that use of <em>regeneration</em> doesn’t count against the
five-use limit.</p>
<p>When the ogre mage is hit by an attack that deals fire or acid
damage, it loses one use of its <em>regeneration</em>, and it can’t
regenerate during its next turn.</p>
<p>Dropping an ogre mage to 0 hp doesn’t kill it if it has any uses of
<em>regeneration</em> left.</p></td>
