<p><strong>R: Poison darts +10 vs. AC</strong>—18 poison damage</p>
<p><em>Poison touch:</em> This monster can coat items with poison. Once
per battle on a hit their attack does an extra ongoing 10 poison damage
(hard save ends). Outside battle they can coat objects with a
skin-contact poison—10 poison damage and 10 ongoing poison damage (save
ends, or hard save if the target ingests the poison).</p>
<p><em>Disguise:</em> Frogspawn deceivers are experts at disguising
themselves as other less froggy races, it requires a DC 25 skill check
to see the truth beneath their veils or deep cloaks and lifelike masks.
Once they attack what they are becomes obvious.</p>
<p><em>Jump:</em> These froggy assassins can jump huge distances. When
the escalation die is even frogspawn deceivers can jump as a quick
action, leaping over enemies and past obstacles in a way that can’t be
intercepted and that doesn’t provoke attacks.</p>

damage.</p></td>
