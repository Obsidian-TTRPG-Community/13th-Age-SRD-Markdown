<p>Vulnerability: holy</p>
<p><strong>Dreadful claws +15 vs. AC (1d3 attacks)</strong>—40 damage
and 40 ongoing damage</p>
<p><em>Two attacks hit the same target on the same turn:</em> The
target’s saves against ongoing damage become hard (16+) until the end of
the battle.</p>
<p><strong>R: Arrows of radiance +15 vs. MD (1d3 nearby
enemies)</strong>—40 force damage, and target is stuck</p>
<p><em>Aftereffect:</em> Enemies who are no longer stuck take 40 ongoing
force damage.</p>
<p><em>Faked miracle, real magic:</em> Once per battle the rakshasa does
something miraculous. Of course the ‘miracle’ is artful illusion
together with some cleverly used basic spells, but all who witness it
must save (11+) or become confused until the end of the rakshasa’s next
turn.</p>
<p><em>Aftereffect:</em> Enemies who are no longer confused become
hampered (save ends).</p>
<p><em>Commanding presence:</em> The rakshasa saint can use a quick
action to command 1d3 confused enemies to move as a free action, or take
another non-attack action (drop a weapon, destroy a potion, unlock a
door) as a free action.</p>
<p><em>Shapechange:</em> As a standard action, the rakshasa can change
its form to that of any humanoid, or back to its own shape. Seeing
through the shapechange requires a DC 25 skill check.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Special</u></p>
<p><em>Real miracles?:</em> The rakshasa has a real link to the divine
(or maybe it’s actually a link to the infernal realms, or a bargain with
the chaos of the outer dark). Twice per battle as a free action the
rakshasa can cause itself or a nearby ally to heal an amount equal to
half that creature’s maximum hit points.</p></td>
