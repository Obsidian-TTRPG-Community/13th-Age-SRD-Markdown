<p><em>Natural 2 or 12 hit:</em> Target is weakened until they next take
damage.</p>
<p><em>Natural 3 or 13 hit:</em> Target is vulnerable to poison attacks
until the end of the battle.</p>
<p><em>Natural 4 or 14 hit:</em> Target is hampered until they next heal
or gain temporary hp.</p>
<p><em>Natural 5 or 15 hit:</em> Target is hampered until they next hit

<p><strong>C: Psychic seduction +11 vs. MD (1d3+1 nearby or faraway
enemies in a group, group must contain at least two targets)</strong>—20
psychic damage, and the target is confused (hard save ends)</p>
<p><em>Miss, but another target in the group was hit:</em> Target is
confused until the end of its next turn.</p>
<p><em>All targets missed:</em> The <em>psychic seduction</em> attack is
not expended can be used again this battle.</p>
<p><em>Limited use:</em> 1/battle.</p>
<p><em>Shapechange:</em> As a standard action, the rakshasa can change
its form to that of any humanoid, or back to its own shape. Seeing
through the shapechange requires a DC 20 skill check.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p><em>Contrabando:</em> The rakshasa has a stash of illicit
substances—once per battle as a quick action, it can either deal 20
ongoing poison damage to one enemy that it has just left engagement with
OR become dazed but heal 30 hit points at the end of each of its turns
(save ends).</p>
<p><em>Shapechanger’s surprise:</em> Once per battle as a quick action
the rakshasa changes forms to something that causes consternation and
misunderstanding among its enemies—causing each enemy to become dazed
until the enemy with the lowest MD saves.</p></td>
