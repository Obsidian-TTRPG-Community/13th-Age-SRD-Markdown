<p><strong>Naginata +11 vs. AC</strong>—The effect depends on the
roll.</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit:</em> 25 damage, and the ogre mage knight can
use <em>lightning pulse</em> as a free action.</p>
<p><em>Natural odd hit:</em> 20 damage, and the ogre mage knight can use
<em>voice of thunder</em> as a free action.</p>
<p><em>Natural even miss:</em> 10 damage, and the ogre mage knight can
teleport to any nearby location it can see before using <em>magi’s
lightning chain</em> as a free action.</p>
<p><em>Natural odd miss:</em> The ogre mage knight can use <em>cone of
cold</em> as a free action.</p>
<p><strong>R: Magi’s lightning chain +11 vs. PD</strong>—15 lightning
damage, and each time this attack has a natural even attack roll, the
ogre mage knight can target a different creature with the ability</p>
<p><strong>C: Cone of cold +11 vs. PD (up to 3 nearby enemies in a
group, also targets the ogre’s allies engaged with the
targets)</strong>—20 cold damage</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> 10 cold damage.</p>
<p><strong>C: Lightning pulse +11 vs. PD (one random nearby or faraway
enemy)</strong>—20 lightning damage</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit:</em> The target is weakened (save ends).</p>
<p><strong>C: Voice of thunder +11 vs. PD (1d3 nearby
enemies)</strong>—15 thunder damage</p>
<p><em>Resist exceptional attacks 16+:</em> When a limited attack (not
an at-will attack) targets this creature, the attacker must roll a
natural 16+ on the attack roll or it only deals half damage.</p>
<p><em>Trollish regeneration 15:</em> While an ogre mage is damaged, its
uncanny flesh heals 15 hit points at the start of the ogre mage’s turn.
It can regenerate five times per battle. If it heals to its maximum hit
points, then that use of <em>regeneration</em> doesn’t count against the
five-use limit.</p>
<p>When the ogre mage is hit by an attack that deals fire or acid
damage, it loses one use of its <em>regeneration</em>, and it can’t
regenerate during its next turn.</p>
<p>Dropping an ogre mage to 0 hp doesn’t kill it if it has any uses of
<em>regeneration</em> left.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p><em>Ki:</em> Gain 1d4 ki at the start of each battle. Spend a point
of ki as a free action, once per round, to change the ogre mage knight’s
natural attack result by one; a natural 1 could become a 2, a natural 19
could become a natural 20, and so on.</p></td>
