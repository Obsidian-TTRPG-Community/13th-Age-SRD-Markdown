<p><strong>Hardened fist +9 vs. AC</strong>—25 damage</p>
<p><em>Natural 14+:</em> The target is stuck until the end of its next
turn as a stone hand rises from the ground to grasp it.</p>
<p><em>Natural 18+:</em> As above, but save ends.</p>
<p><strong>C: Hard words +9 vs. MD (1d3 nearby enemies)</strong>—20
psychic damage, and the target is overcome by the cold beauty and
piercing words of the oread (save ends); while overcome, the target
takes a penalty to all defenses equal to the escalation die</p>
<p><em>Natural 16+:</em> The target also takes the penalty to
attacks.</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> 10 psychic damage.</p>
<p><em>Limited use:</em> 1/battle.</p>
<p><em>Earth’s embrace:</em> Once per battle as a move action, the oread
can pull one creature currently overcome by its <em>hard words</em>
attack under the ground into an embrace with a part of its
consciousness. The oread’s physical form remains above ground and
continues to battle. The target remains underground, taking no actions
except to bond with the oread and telepathically reveal its secrets to
the oread until it saves. While underground, it can’t be seen or
targeted by allies. Saving from being overcome releases the target from
underground.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Special</u></p>
<p><em>Resist weapon damage 12+:</em> When a weapon attack targets this
creature, the attacker must roll a natural 12+ on the attack roll or it
only deals half damage.</p></td>
