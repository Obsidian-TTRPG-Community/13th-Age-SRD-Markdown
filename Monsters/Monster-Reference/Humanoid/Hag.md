<p><strong>Iron claws +10 vs. AC (2 attacks)</strong>—9 damage</p>
<p><em>Natural 14+:</em> The hag triggers one <em>hag ability</em> as a
free action.</p>
<p><em>Natural 18+:</em> The hag triggers two <em>hag abilities</em> as
a free action (can’t be the same ability twice).</p>
<p><strong>R: Evil eye +10 vs. MD</strong>—Ongoing 12 damage (hard save
ends, 16+)</p>
<p><em>Natural 16+:</em> The attack roll also targets a second different
enemy of the hag’s choice (but not a third with another 16+).</p>
<p><em>Natural 18+:</em> As above, and the attack roll also targets a
third different enemy of the hag’s choice (but not a fourth with another
18+).</p>
<p><em>Death curse:</em> Each hag can lay a curse upon the one who ends
its horrible life. After dropping to 0 hit points, a hag always lingers
long enough to pronounce the words of the curse. (See Death Curses.)</p>
<p><em>Delusionist:</em> All hags have the ability to twist the
perceptions of others. If the hag has a short time to prepare, it can
hide a small hut, disguise a volunteer or captive as a monster, disguise
itself as a harmless peasant woman, etc. A DC 30 skill check is required
to overcome the delusion and see the truth of it (if a player gives a
reason for not trusting what their character sees; perhaps add subtle
clues toward that end). The magic fades as soon as the hag enters
combat.</p>
<p><em>Fear:</em> While engaged with this creature, enemies with 30 hp
or fewer are dazed (–4 attack) and do not add the escalation die to
their attacks.</p></td>
