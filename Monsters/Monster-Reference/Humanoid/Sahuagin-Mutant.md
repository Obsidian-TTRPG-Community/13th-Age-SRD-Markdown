## Salamander

<u>Abilities for All Salamanders</u>

*Escalating inferno:* If the salamander is in an area with flames, lava,  
or that it has set on fire, it gets to use the escalation die, adding it  
to its attack rolls. Even when not fighting in such an environment, a  
salamander attacked with a spell or attack that deals fire damage gets  
to use the escalation die until the end of its next turn, or longer if  
it’s a powerful or lingering spell. Avoid casting fireball in battle  
with a salamander!

*Resist fire 16+:* Fire attacks against the salamander must roll a  
natural 16+ attack roll or the attack does half damage. Whether or not  
such an attack hits, see escalating inferno!

<u>Nastier Special</u>

*Heat metal:* Enemies who make a melee attack with a non-magical weapon  
against a salamander and who roll a natural 1 or 3 take ongoing fire  
damage equal to twice the salamander’s level unless they drop their  
weapon as a free action.
