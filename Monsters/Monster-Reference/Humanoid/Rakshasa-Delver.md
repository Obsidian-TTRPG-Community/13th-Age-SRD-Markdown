<p><strong>Awful bite +14 vs. AC (3 attacks)</strong>—25 damage, and
target is hampered (save ends)</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> 8 damage.</p>
<p><strong>C: Ten-foot collapsing staff +14 vs. AC (one nearby enemy, or
+10 attack against two nearby enemies)</strong>—60 damage, and if there
is a pit or ledge next to the target it must save or be pushed off and
potentially take falling damage</p>
<p><strong>R: Mesmerizing magic +14 vs. MD (1d3 nearby or faraway
enemies that can see the rakshasa)</strong>—25 psychic damage, and if it
is the first time this battle this target is hit it becomes confused
until the end of its next turn</p>
<p><em>Aftereffect:</em> When the target is no longer confused it takes
50 psychic damage.</p>
<p><em>Shadowy step:</em> When the escalation die advances the rakshasa
teleports as a free action to any spot it can see nearby or faraway. If
the rakshasa is engaged with a PC, that character’s player can choose to
prevent the teleportation at the cost of the escalation die not
advancing.</p>
<p><em>Shadow pounce:</em> Once per round as a free action when an enemy
moves into engagement with the rakshasa it can roll a save (11+), on a
success the rakshasa teleports into engagement with the enemy with the
fewest hit points.</p>
<p><em>Shapechange:</em> As a standard action, the rakshasa can change
its form to that of any humanoid, or back to its own shape. Seeing
through the shapechange requires a DC 20 skill check.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Special</u></p>
<p><em>Allies:</em> The rakshasa isn’t alone—it bought a team of
hirelings and hangers-on into the dungeon with it, though they are
currently elsewhere. When the escalation die reaches 3+ these allies
rush into the fight and act at the start of the round.</p></td>
