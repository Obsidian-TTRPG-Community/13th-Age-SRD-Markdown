<p><strong>Morningstar of reckoning +15 vs. AC</strong>—70 damage</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> Half damage.</p>
<p><strong>R: Charnel wind +15 vs. PD (1 or 2 nearby or faraway
enemies)</strong>—88 negative energy damage</p>
<p><em>Natural 16+:</em> The high priest can make a <em>cull the
weak</em> attack as a free action.</p>
<p><em>[Special trigger]</em> <strong>C: Cull the weak +15 vs. MD (1
nearby enemy)</strong>—15 psychic damage, and any ghoul or ghast
attacking the target gains a +5 attack bonus until the start of the
priest’s next turn</p>
<p><em>Summon ghouls:</em> The jackal high priest starts each battle
accompanied by a mob of 1d6 + 1 10th level greater summoned ghoul mooks.
(The mooks gained via this ability are accounted for in the building
battle math by the jackal priest’s designation as a double-strength
monster.) At the start of each of the jackal priest’s turns, (whether or
not the jackal high priest is engaged!) roll a d6. If you roll less than
or equal to the escalation die, use the jackal priest’s standard action
to add another mob of 1d6 + 1 greater summoned ghoul mooks to the
battle. The newly summoned mooks take their turn after the jackal high
priest’s turn. Stop rolling the d6 after the ability has triggered to
summon the second mob of ghoul mooks.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p><em>Fear aura:</em> While engaged with this creature, if the target
has 72 hp or fewer, it’s dazed (–4 attack) and does not add the
escalation die to its attacks.</p>
<p><em>Last rites:</em> When a jackal high priest drops to 0 hp, each
creature that isn’t allied with it must roll a hard save (16+). On a
failure, it takes 12 psychic damage.</p>
<p>In addition, the high priest can use summon ghouls as a free
action.</p></td>
