<p><strong>Coral rod +10 vs. AC</strong>—12 damage</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit or miss:</em> The priest teleports the target
next to one of its nearby allies that it can see, who engages it as a
free action. It can’t teleport the target to a location that causes it
direct damage (so into a pool of flaming oil is out, but off a ship into
the sea is fine).</p>
<p><strong>R: Glowpriest’s prayer +10 vs. MD (1d3 nearby
enemies)</strong>—12 psychic damage, and if the attack hits 2 or more
targets, roll 1d8 after the attack for the prayer’s effect</p>
<p><em>1–2 (Hymn of hate):</em> One random nearby conscious enemy takes
4d6 negative energy damage.</p>
<p><em>3–4 (Curse of despair):</em> Each target that was hit takes a –2
penalty (non-cumulative) to all saves until the end of the battle.</p>
<p><em>5–6 (Scream of victory):</em> Until the start of the glowpriest’s
next turn, each sahuagin and demon in the battle adds the escalation die
to its attacks and the PCs don’t.</p>
<p><em>7–8 (Word of refuge):</em> Remove the glowpriest from play. At
the start of its next turn, return it to play nearby its original
location. It gains a +4 bonus to all defenses until the end of its next
turn after it returns to play.</p>
<p><em>Water breather:</em> Sahuagin breathe underwater and swim very
well.</p></td>
