<p><em>Natural roll is above target’s Constitution:</em> The target
catches a disease (see below).</p>
<p>When a creature contracts a death-plague orc disease, roll a d4 for
the disease type and a d6 for that disease’s symptoms <em>after the
battle</em>. Until cured, at the start of each day (after each full
heal-up) the PC makes a Constitution check (including any appropriate
background) to determine the severity of the disease for that day, or if
the PC is cured.</p>
<p>Full bed rest under the care of a healer reduces severity roll from a
d6 to a d4 (so a severity check result of 18 would be 1d4 + 2 not 1d6 +
2). A PC under the care of and experience healer or someone who knows
healing magic gains a +10 bonus to the Constitution check. At the GM’s
option, special ingredients or healing items, found via quest, can give
additional bonuses to the check.</p>
<p>Disease Type (d4)</p>
<p>1: Filthy Fever</p>
<p>2: Chatter Pox</p>
<p>3: Slug Scourge</p>
<p>4: Red Fever</p>
<p>Disease Severity (Con check each day; result affects d6 symptoms
roll)</p>
<p>1–14: d6 + 3</p>
<p>15–19: d6 + 2</p>
<p>20–24: d6 + 1</p>
<p>25–29: d6 + 0</p>
<p>30+: Cured</p>
<p>Filthy Fever Symptoms (d6 roll for symptoms that day)</p>
<p>1: Slight temperature.</p>
<p>2–3: The runs. You gain 1 less recovery than normal after a full
heal-up due to fluid loss.</p>
<p>4+: You have a hacking cough that sounds like insane laughter and are
losing fluids. You gain 2 fewer recoveries than normal after a full
heal-up and can’t remain silent.</p>
<p>Chatter Pox Symptoms (d6 roll for symptoms that day)</p>
<p>1: Unsightly and painful sores, occasional shivers.</p>
<p>2–3: Running sores, shivering and chattering teeth. You take a –3
penalty to social skill checks and to attack rolls with spells.</p>
<p>4+: Infected sores, fever dreams. Your constitution is weakened.
After each full heal-up, roll 1d4 + 3 to determine your starting maximum
recoveries for that day. Each time you cast a spell that isn’t at-will,
there’s a 25% chance it fails (but you don’t expend the spell).</p>
<p>Slug Scourge Symptoms (d6 roll for symptoms that day)</p>
<p>1: Extreme appetite, nausea.</p>
<p>2–3: Vomiting up slugs. Whenever you make a non-combat Charisma
check, roll 2d20 and take the lower result.</p>
<p>4+: The slugs are inside your lungs! After each quick rest, you lose
25% of your maximum hit points. If you drop to 0 hp this way, you enter
into a coma until the next day.</p>
<p>Red Fever Symptoms (d6 roll for symptoms that day)</p>
<p>1: Scarlet stripes on the eyeballs, itching, buzzing in ears.</p>
<p>2–3: Blurred vision. You take a –3 penalty to ranged attacks.</p>
<p>4+: Fever, rage, and confusion. Whenever you roll a natural odd
attack roll, you are confused until the end of your next turn. Ranged
attacks have a 25% chance of accidentally targeting an ally (check
before making the attack roll).</p></td>
