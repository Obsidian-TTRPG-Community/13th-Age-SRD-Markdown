creatures)</strong>—30 psychic damage</p>
<p><em>Hit against a frogspawn ally:</em> If it wasn’t killed by the
attack, the ally heals 60 hit points and immediately moves as a free
action.</p>
<p><em>Miss against an enemy:</em> 15 ongoing psychic damage.</p>
<p><strong>C: Mindblast +12 vs. MD (one or two nearby or faraway enemies
in a group)</strong>—35 psychic damage</p>
<p><em>Natural odd hit when the escalation die is odd:</em> The target’s
next move action is controlled by the old one.</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit when the escalation die is even:</em> The next
time the target attacks, if it includes the old one in the attack the
old one may make a free <em>mindblast</em> attack against the
target.</p>
<p><em>Levitating throne:</em> The old-one is much too ponderous to move
on its own, but can levitate its throne slowly about. Allies of the
old-one that are next to it can cling to the throne for a free ride.
Engaged enemies that could make an opportunity attack against the
frogspawn old one when it moves can instead roll a save (11+) to cling
on as well.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Special</u></p>
<p><em>Hallucinogenic sweat:</em> Enemies who miss with a melee attack
must save (11+) or become confused until the end of their next turn. The
save is easy (6+) for characters who missed with a longish weapon like a
staff or spear, hard (16+) for those who missed with an unarmed
attack.</p></td>
