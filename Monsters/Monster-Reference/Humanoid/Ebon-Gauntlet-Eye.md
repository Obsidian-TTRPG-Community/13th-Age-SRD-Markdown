<p><strong>R: Echo of nightmares +11 vs. MD (1d3 nearby or faraway
enemies)</strong>—20 psychic damage, and the target is hampered and
dazed (save ends both); the target can remove these conditions by taking
an additional 10 psychic damage and allowing one of its most terrible
memories to ripple through its nearby allies, dealing 1 psychic damage
to each nearby ally</p>

with at least one mind spike attack.</p>
<p><em>Gray shift:</em> Once per hit it has scored this battle, as a
move action, the eye can teleport to any nearby location it can see.</p>
<p><em>Echo fade:</em> Once per battle, as an interrupt action, the eye
can gain <em>resist damage 18+</em> against attacks that target AC or
PD. The resistance ends when the eye makes an attack.</p></td>
