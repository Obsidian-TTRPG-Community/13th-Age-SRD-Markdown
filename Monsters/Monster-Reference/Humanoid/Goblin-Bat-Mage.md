<p>Vulnerability: thunder</p>
<p><strong>Bloody fangs +7 vs. AC</strong>—6 damage, and 6 ongoing
damage</p>
<p><em>Natural 2–5:</em> The goblin bat mage pops free from the target
and can move as a free action.</p>
<p><strong>R: Blood bolt spell +7 vs. PD</strong>—8 negative energy
damage</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit:</em> If target is staggered after taking the
damage, it’s also hampered until the end of its next turn.</p>
<p><em>Natural odd hit:</em> One random nearby ally of the target takes
2d6 negative energy damage.</p>
<p><em>Resist ranged damage 16+:</em> When a ranged attack targets this
creature while it’s flying, the attacker must roll a natural 16+ on the
attack roll or it only deals half damage.</p>
<p><em>Skittish:</em> A goblin bat mage engaged with a conscious enemy
after attacking it will attempt to disengage and fly into the air if it
has a move action remaining that turn.</p>
<p><em>Unwieldy flyer:</em> When the goblin bat mage is staggered, it
must roll an immediate save. On a failure, it loses its ability to fly
until the end of its next turn. If flying near the ground, it lands
immediately. If flying faraway from the ground, it lands badly and takes
15 damage.</p></td>
