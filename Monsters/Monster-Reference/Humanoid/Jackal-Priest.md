attacks)</strong>—18 damage</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit:</em> The target also takes 5 ongoing
damage.</p>

negative energy damage</p>
<p><em>Natural 16+:</em> The target takes 10 extra psychic damage.</p>
<p><em>Summon ghouls:</em> The jackal priest starts each battle
accompanied by a mob of 1d4 + 1 7<sup>th</sup> level summoned ghoul
mooks. (The mooks gained via this ability are accounted for in the
building battle math by the jackal priest’s designation as an elite
monster.) At the start of each of the jackal priest’s turns, if the
jackal priest is not engaged, roll a d6. If you roll less than or equal
to the escalation die, use the jackal priest’s standard action to add
another mob of 1d4 + 1 summoned ghoul mooks to the battle. The newly
summoned mooks take their turn after the jackal priest’s turn. Stop
rolling the d6 after the ability has triggered to summon the second mob
of ghoul mooks.</p>
<p><em>Elite:</em> When building battles with this monster, it counts as
1.5 of a monster at 7<sup>th</sup> level.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Special</u></p>
<p><em>Last breath:</em> As the jackal priest drops to 0 hp, she can use
<em>summon ghouls</em> as a free action.</p></td>
