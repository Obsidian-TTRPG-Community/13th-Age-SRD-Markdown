<p><strong>C: Willowy words +7 vs. MD (1d2 nearby enemies)</strong>—The
target is confused (save ends)</p>
<p><em>Natural 16+:</em> The save is hard (16+) instead.</p>
<p><em>Environmental boost:</em> The dryad gains a +4 bonus to the
attack against targets that have consumed natural food or water within
the dryad’s domain within the last day.</p>
<p><em>Tree stride:</em> As a move action, a dryad can enter any living
tree within its domain it’s touching and teleport to another tree within
that region. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p><em>Call tree friends:</em> Before the start of the battle, the dryad
summons 2d4 awakened trees that fight with it.</p>
<p><em>Entrancing beauty:</em> The dryad can appear as a beautiful wood
elf. While speaking with creatures outside of battle, the dryad can
choose to add power to its words to try to charm those listening. Make a
<em>willowy words</em> attack against each creature that can hear the
dryad. On a hit, instead of being confused, the target is charmed (as
per the charm person spell). It then considers the dryad a friend.
Creatures missed by the attack only notice the charm attempt if it
misses by 4 or more. A dryad can attempt to charm a creature only once
per day.</p>
<p><em>Woodland grace:</em> The dryad can take an extra standard action
during its turn when the escalation die is even.</p></td>
