<p><strong>Naginata +14 vs. AC (2 attacks)</strong>—40 damage</p>

<p><strong>R: Lightning from torn sky +14 vs. PD (up to 2 nearby
enemies, plus one faraway enemy, if any)</strong>—52 lightning
damage</p>
<p><em>Limited use:</em> 1/battle, but the ogre lightning mage regains
the use of this attack if it’s expended each time it uses its
<em>naginata</em> attack.</p>
<p><strong>R: Past master’s judgment +14 vs. MD (1d3 nearby
enemies)</strong>—25 psychic damage</p>
<p><em>First natural even hit each attack:</em> The ogre lightning mage
can cancel one spell or magical effect created by the target.</p>
<p><em>Flight:</em> The ogre lightning mage flies well using the sheer
power of its superior mind.</p>
<p><em>Invisibility:</em> While not engaged, the ogre lightning mage can
turn invisible as an at-will standard action. It becomes visible when it
attacks. The ogre mage takes 1d10 damage each time it uses
<em>invisibility</em> while it’s staggered.</p>
<p><em>Resist exceptional attacks 16+:</em> When a limited attack (not
an at-will attack) targets this creature, the attacker must roll a
natural 16+ on the attack roll or it only deals half damage.</p>
<p><em>Trollish regeneration 20:</em> While an ogre mage is damaged, its
uncanny flesh heals 20 hit points at the start of the ogre mage’s turn.
It can regenerate five times per battle. If it heals to its maximum hit
points, then that use of <em>regeneration</em> doesn’t count against the
five-use limit.</p>
<p>When the ogre mage is hit by an attack that deals fire or acid
damage, it loses one use of its <em>regeneration</em>, and it can’t
regenerate during its next turn.</p>
<p>Dropping an ogre mage to 0 hp doesn’t kill it if it has any uses of
<em>regeneration</em> left.</p></td>
