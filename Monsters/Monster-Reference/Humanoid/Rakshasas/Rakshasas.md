## Rakshasa

<u>Nastier Special for all rakshasas</u>

*Lockheart:* The first time a rakshasa is dropped to 0 hit points, it  
dies but will definitely be reborn, even if the PCs attempt to use an  
icon die result to prevent the resurrection. A PC who scores a critical  
hit against the rakshasa can attempt to nullify *lockheart* by choosing  
to ignore all other effects of the critical hit (all damage, not just  
the doubling) and attempting a normal save. If the save succeeds,  
*lockheart* is ignored this battle. If the save fails, *lockheart* is  
still in effect. A rakshasa can only use *lockheart* once in its  
lifetime.

Alternatively, instead of rolling saves, the PCs could go on a quest to  
find the lockheart’s key before confronting the rakshasa! That’s a story  
angle you get to manipulate as you choose.

*Backwards palms:* When staggered, the rakshasa’s hands shapeshift so  
that its palms trade places with the backs of its hands. It not only  
looks extremely weird, it also presents the player characters with an  
odd choice: The next time the escalation die would advance, the PCs have  
to choose whether the escalation die will decrease by 1 (minimum 0) or  
whether this rakshasa gets to use the escalation die until the end of  
the battle. If the PC group is split, the decision goes to the character  
with the highest initiative.
