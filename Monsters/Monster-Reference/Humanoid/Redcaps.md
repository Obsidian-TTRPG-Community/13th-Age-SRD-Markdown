## Redcap

All redcaps have special abilities based on *The Bad Word*. Before every  
battle against redcaps, the GM should determine the *bad word* for that  
battle. Whenever a PC or a player at the table says the word, every  
redcap in the battle can use their associated ability as a free action  
that interrupts whatever action is currently happening.
