| 2×<br>12th level<br>Leader<br>Humanoid 	| Initiative: +20<br>Thorny scepter +17 vs. AC—100 damage<br>Natural 16+ hit: 80 ongoing poison damage.<br>Aftereffect: When the target saves against the poison damage it becomes dazed (–4 attack) until the end of its next turn.<br>Miss: 50 damage.<br>C: Verdant evolution +18 vs. PD (one nearby enemy)—80 poison damage and 50 ongoing poison damage<br>Aftereffect: When the target saves against the poison damage it becomes confused until the end of its next turn.<br>Natural 18+ hit: Until the end of the battle the target’s saves against poison damage all become hard saves (16+).<br>The sovereign’s orders: When the escalation die is 1, as a free action the sovereign can cause an ally to reroll a missed attack and take the better roll. When the escalation die value is 2 the sovereign can do this twice during the round. When the escalation die is 3+ the sovereign gets to order three attacks rerolled.<br>Choose one<br>Humanoid: The sovereign has a magic item. You don’t need to work out what the item is right now, just give it +2 to all its defenses, saves, and attacks to represent a generic magical ‘thing’. Once the battle is over the adventurers can loot the body for a magic item, and you can reveal/decide what the item actually is.<br>Plant: This monster’s type is [PLANT]. Whenever the briar elf sovereign is standing on soil and doesn’t move on its turn it heals 14 hit points.<br>Undead: This monster’s type is [UNDEAD]. Other undead refuse to fight this monster (sorry necromancers). Cleric attack spells that target this monster only deal half damage on a hit.<br>Nastier Specials<br>Royal command: The briar elf sovereign is no longer capped at three rerolls per round from the sovereign’s orders—it gets four when the escalation die is 4, five rerolls when the escalation die is 5, and can order six allies a round to reroll their attacks once the escalation die reaches 6.<br>Fear aura: Enemies engaged with this briar elf who have fewer than 120 hp are dazed (–4 attack) and can’t use the escalation die.<br>Dark escalator: On turns when the escalation die is even the briar elves uses the escalation die, and their enemies do not. 	| AC<br>PD<br>MD<br>HP 	| 28<br>24<br>26<br>750 	|
