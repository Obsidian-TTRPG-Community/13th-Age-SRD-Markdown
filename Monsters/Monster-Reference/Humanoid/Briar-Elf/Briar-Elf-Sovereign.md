<p><strong>Thorny scepter +17 vs. AC</strong>—100 damage</p>
<p><em>Natural 16+ hit:</em> 80 ongoing poison damage.</p>
<p><em>Aftereffect:</em> When the target saves against the poison damage
it becomes dazed (–4 attack) until the end of its next turn.</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> 50 damage.</p>
<p><strong>C: Verdant evolution +18 vs. PD (one nearby
enemy)</strong>—80 poison damage and 50 ongoing poison damage</p>
<p><em>Aftereffect:</em> When the target saves against the poison damage
it becomes confused until the end of its next turn.</p>
<p><em>Natural 18+ hit:</em> Until the end of the battle the target’s
saves against poison damage all become hard saves (16+).</p>
<p><em>The sovereign’s orders:</em> When the escalation die is 1, as a
free action the sovereign can cause an ally to reroll a missed attack
and take the better roll. When the escalation die value is 2 the
sovereign can do this twice during the round. When the escalation die is
3+ the sovereign gets to order three attacks rerolled.</p>
<p><u>Choose one</u></p>
<p><em>Humanoid:</em> The sovereign has a magic item. You don’t need to
work out what the item is right now, just give it +2 to all its
defenses, saves, and attacks to represent a generic magical ‘thing’.
Once the battle is over the adventurers can loot the body for a magic
item, and you can reveal/decide what the item actually is.</p>
<p><em>Plant:</em> This monster’s type is [PLANT]. Whenever the briar
elf sovereign is standing on soil and doesn’t move on its turn it heals
14 hit points.</p>
<p><em>Undead:</em> This monster’s type is [UNDEAD]. Other undead refuse
to fight this monster (sorry necromancers). Cleric attack spells that
target this monster only deal half damage on a hit.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p><em>Royal command:</em> The briar elf sovereign is no longer capped
at three rerolls per round from <em>the sovereign’s orders</em>—it gets
four when the escalation die is 4, five rerolls when the escalation die
is 5, and can order six allies a round to reroll their attacks once the
escalation die reaches 6.</p>
<p><em>Fear aura:</em> Enemies engaged with this briar elf who have
fewer than 120 hp are dazed (–4 attack) and can’t use the escalation
die.</p>
<p><em>Dark escalator:</em> On turns when the escalation die is even the
briar elves uses the escalation die, and their enemies do not.</p></td>
