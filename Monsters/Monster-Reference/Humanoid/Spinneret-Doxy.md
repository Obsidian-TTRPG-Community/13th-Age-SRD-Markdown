<p><strong>Bite of the love bug +8 vs. AC (or automatic critical hit vs.
an <em>infatuated</em> enemy)</strong>—10 damage, and target is
<em>infatuated</em> (save ends)</p>
<p><em>Infatuated:</em> Infatuated enemies can’t attack the spinneret
doxy or her Woven, but can convince themselves that other allies of the
doxy don’t love her properly and should be slain. They also prattle on
about how their friends shouldn’t attack her, but are too love-smitten
to properly prevent it—they won’t attack their real allies.</p>
<p><strong>R: Bring me flowers +8 vs. MD (one <em>infatuated</em>
enemy)</strong>—The target chooses one: it takes 6d6 psychic damage; OR
as a free action, it moves next to the spinneret doxy (possibly
provoking opportunity attacks), who engages it</p>
<p><strong>C: Stop in the name of love +8 vs. MD (each nearby
<em>infatuated</em> enemy)</strong>—The target chooses one: it takes 6d6
psychic damage; OR it’s stuck (save ends)</p>
<p><em>Give me your heart:</em> When the doxy drops an enemy to 0 hit
points or lower, she will move next to that creature and attempt to
remove the target’s heart. The creature must begin making last gasp
saves as she cuts their chest open. On the fourth failure, the doxy
takes the heart and the target dies and becomes undead under her
control. If the bride is stunned or moved away from the creature and
can’t return to it on her turn, the creature doesn’t have to make a last
gasp save that turn.</p></td>
