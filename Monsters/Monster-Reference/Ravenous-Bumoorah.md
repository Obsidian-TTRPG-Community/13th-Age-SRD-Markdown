<p><em>Natural even hit:</em> The target takes 10 thunder damage.</p>
<p><em>Blood-frenzy escalator:</em> While at least one creature in the
battle is staggered or unconscious, the bulette gains a bonus to its
attacks and damage equal to the escalation die. Creatures that have no
blood (constructs, oozes, plant creatures, etc.) don’t trigger this
ability.</p>
<p><em>Earth surge:</em> Whenever the bumoorah takes damage from an
attack, it rolls a save; on a 16+ it can immediately dive beneath the
ground, preventing further attacks against it until it surfaces at the
start of its next turn. Force attacks and opportunity attacks don’t
trigger this ability.</p>
<p><em>Serious burrower:</em> The bumoorah can burrow incredibly quickly
for short distances. Bumoorahs are renowned for the dust-spurts and
vibrating sound they generate as they shoot through the ground like
hungry spears.</p></td>
