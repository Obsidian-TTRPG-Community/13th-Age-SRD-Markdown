<p><em>Standard abilities: Shape-shifter supreme, cunning escapes, “No,
they’re the real Purple dragon, shoot them!”, flight, illusionary
soiree.</em></p>
<p><u>Human form</u></p>
<p><strong>Bladed fan +10 vs. AC</strong>—25 damage</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit or miss:</em> Make a second <em>bladed fan</em>
attack, and if that is a natural even roll make a third <em>bladed
fan</em> attack.</p>
<p><em>Natural odd hit:</em> The target is blown back from the Purple
Dragon.</p>
<p><em>Natural odd miss:</em> The Purple Dragon pops free and moves away
from the target (blown by the wind of the fan).</p>
<p><strong>R: Bedazzling deceptions +9 vs. MD (1d3 nearby
enemies)</strong>—10 psychic damage and 10 ongoing psychic damage</p>
<p><em>Crit against a target already taking ongoing psychic damage:</em>
The target must start making last gasp saves, if they fail they believe
that they are the Purple Dragon. Removing this delusion from the
target’s mind is as difficult as turning a petrified character back from
stone (hard, but not impossible).</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> 7 psychic damage.</p>
<p><em>[Once per battle] “No, they’re the real Purple Dragon, shoot
them”:</em> The Purple Dragon uses their powers of illusion and
mind-control to make one of their attackers look and sound like them;
the next attack has a 50% chance of being targeted against the wrong
target.</p>
<p><u>Dragon form</u></p>
<p><strong>Painted claws +9 vs. AC</strong>—40 damage</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> 14 damage.</p>
<p><strong>C: Psychoactive breath +9 vs. MD (1d4 nearby enemies, or 1d3
faraway enemies in a group)</strong>—25 psychic damage</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit:</em> The target is also dazed (save ends).</p>
<p><em>Intermittent breath:</em> The Purple Dragon can use their
psychoactive breath 2d4 times each combat but never two turns in a row.
They can also choose to make their targets confused (save ends) on a hit
or miss with their <em>psychoactive breath</em>, but that uses up their
breath for the rest of the battle.</p>
<p><em>Wing buffet:</em> That <em>bladed fan</em> attack? Yeah, that was
the Purple Dragon’s wings hidden by an illusion. The Purple Dragon can
use the <em>bladed fan</em> attack in this form, but now it is clear
that they are using their wings so it is only +9 to attack.</p>
<p><em>[Once per battle] Cloak of illusion:</em> As a quick action the
Purple Dragon fills the battlefield with illusions that give enemies
attacking them a -2 penalty to their attacks. This lasts until they next
attack.</p></td>
