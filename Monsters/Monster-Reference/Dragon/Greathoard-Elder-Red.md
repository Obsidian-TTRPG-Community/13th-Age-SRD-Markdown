<p><strong>Fangs, claws, and wings +16 vs. AC (2 attacks)</strong>—90
damage</p>
<p><em>Natural 14+:</em> The target takes 12 extra damage from a wing
buffet.</p>
<p><em>Natural 16+:</em> The target takes 20 extra damage from a claw
strike.</p>
<p><em>Natural 19+:</em> The dragon can make a <em>treasury master</em>
attack as a free action.</p>
<p><strong>C: Treasury master +16 vs. MD (the nearby non-confused enemy
with the most true magic items)</strong>—30 psychic damage, and the
target is confused (save ends)</p>
<p><em>Limited use:</em> 2/battle, as a quick action (once per
round).</p>
<p><strong>C: Precise breath +16 vs. PD (1d4 + 1 nearby enemies, or one
enemy)</strong>—50 fire damage, and 15 ongoing fire damage; OR 170 fire
damage, and 30 ongoing fire damage if used against a single enemy</p>
<p><em>Natural 18+:</em> If the breath targeted multiple enemies, the
target takes 25 ongoing fire damage instead of 15. If the breath
targeted a single enemy, the target takes 60 ongoing fire damage instead
of 30.</p>
<p><em>Call of the hoard:</em> When an enemy is engaged with the
greathoard elder in its lair at the start of its turn, it must roll a
normal save; on a failure, it hurls one random non-armor true magic item
into the dragon’s hoard (adjust stats accordingly). The item is
unavailable until the end of the battle. If the dragon flees or is
defeated, lost magic items can be retrieved.</p>
<p><em>Greathoard rage:</em> When an enemy scores a critical hit against
the greathoard elder while it’s in its lair, the elder can reroll one of
its missed attacks each round (cumulative) as its hoard sings a song of
carnage to it.</p>
<p><em>Intermittent breath:</em> A greathoard elder can use <em>precise
breath</em> 1d4 + 1 times per battle, but never two turns in a row.</p>
<p><em>Resist fire 16+:</em> When a fire attack targets this creature,
the attacker must roll a natural 16+ on the attack roll or it only deals
half damage.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p><em>Iconic comparisons:</em> The dragon is enamored/envious of the
icons with the greatest hoards. For each PC who has at least one
positive or conflicted relationship point with one or more of those
icons, the greathoard elder gains an extra use of <em>treasury
master</em> this battle.</p></td>
