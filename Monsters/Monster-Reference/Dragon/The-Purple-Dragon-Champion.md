<p><em>Standard abilities: Shape-shifter supreme, cunning escapes, “No,
they’re the real Purple dragon, shoot them!”, flight, illusionary
soiree.</em></p>
<p><u>Human form</u></p>
<p><strong>Bladed fan +14 vs. AC</strong>—68 damage</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit or miss:</em> Make a second <em>bladed fan</em>
attack, and if that is a natural even roll make a third <em>bladed
fan</em> attack.</p>
<p><em>Natural odd hit:</em> The target is blown back from the Purple
Dragon.</p>
<p><em>Natural odd miss:</em> The Purple Dragon pops free and moves away
from the target (blown by the wind of the fan).</p>
<p><strong>C: Mirrorball burst +13 vs. MD (1d4 nearby or faraway
enemies)</strong>—35 damage and 30 ongoing psychic damage</p>
<p><em>Target fails a save against the ongoing damage:</em> The target
is dazzled by light and takes a cumulative -1 penalty to attacks (up to
a maximum of -4) until the end of the battle.</p>
<p><u>Dragon form</u></p>
<p><strong>Gilded claws +13 vs. AC (2 attacks)</strong>—50 damage</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> 28 damage.</p>
<p><strong>C: Psychoactive breath +13 vs. MD (1d4 nearby enemies, or 1d3
faraway enemies in a group)</strong>—40 psychic damage and 10 ongoing
psychic damage</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit, once per target per battle:</em> The target is
also dazed and stuck (save once for both effects and the ongoing
damage).</p>
<p><em>Aftereffect:</em> Once the target saves against the ongoing
damage if the save was a natural odd roll the target is dazed (save
ends).</p>
<p><em>Intermittent breath:</em> The Purple Dragon can use their
<em>psychoactive breath</em> 2d4 times each combat but never two turns
in a row. They can choose to make their targets confused (save ends) on
a hit or miss with their <em>psychoactive breath</em>, but that uses up
their breath for the rest of the battle.</p>
<p><em>Wing buffet:</em> Just like adventurer tier, the <em>bladed
fan</em> attack translates in dragon form to wing buffet but with only
+13 to attack.</p>
<p><em>[Once per battle] Cloak of illusion:</em> As a quick action the
Purple Dragon fills the battlefield with illusions that give enemies
attacking them a -2 penalty to their attacks. This lasts until they next
attack.</p></td>
