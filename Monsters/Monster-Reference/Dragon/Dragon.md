## Dragon

All dragons have two standard abilities: *escalator* and *flight*. The  
escalator ability allows the dragon to add the escalation die to its  
attack rolls. The flight ability allows the dragon to fly—fairly well,  
and quickly in a straight line, though not as maneuverable as more agile  
fliers.

Dragons have a breath attack. Unlike most close attacks that target a  
number of enemies, dragon breath attacks don’t care about whether the  
targets are in a group.

Young dragons are medium-sized. Adult dragons are usually large sized.  
Huge-sized dragons are the exception, and have usually outgrown the  
vulnerabilities of their weaker kin.

Some metallic dragons inspire debilitating awe in their enemies. The  
*inspire awe* ability is similar to *fear*, but it’s not fear, so its  
effect can combine with the dazed condition. Enemies at a hit point  
threshold or lower take a –4 penalty to limited attacks (attacks that  
aren’t basic or at-will) against the dragon—the enemy’s confidence in  
their own heroism/puissance is shaken.

Each metallic dragon has an at-will breath weapon attack that uses the  
natural result of the first attack roll to determine how long the dragon  
must wait before it can use the breath weapon again.

| Natural Attack Roll | Variable Waiting Period for Metallic Dragon’s At-Will Breath Attack                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| 1-5                 | The dragon can use its breath weapon again next turn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 6-10                | The dragon must wait one turn before it can use its breath weapon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 11+                 | After waiting one turn, the dragon rolls a normal save at the start of its next turn. If it succeeds, it can use its breath weapon that turn. Otherwise, it keeps rolling a save at the start of each turn until it regains its breath weapon attack. Once it uses its breath again, use the attack roll again to determine its next *breath weapon* attack. |

All dragons have distinct personalities. A few have unique features.  
They are smart enough not to fight to their own death.

Dragons may have random abilities. This table is for chromatic dragons.  
For GMs who are uncertain whether a medium dragon should have a random  ability, roll a d8. Otherwise, roll a d12. If the roll is less than or  equal to the dragon’s level, it gets a random ability according to the  table below. Some huge dragons have two abilities. If you want to give  the dragon a chance of having one of the abilities that has campaign implications, add +2 to the roll.

| 1                    | True seeing           | The dragon is immune to invisibility and ignores any illusions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 2                    | Whipping tail         | When an enemy engaged with the dragon rolls a natural 1 or 2 with an attack roll, the dragon can make an opportunity attack against that creature as a free action. The attack is set up by the dragon’s whipping tail but delivered by the dragon’s usual melee attack.                               |
| 3                    | Tough Hide            | The dragon has a +1 bonus to AC.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| 5                    | Nimble                | The dragon has a +2 bonus to PD.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 6                    | No vulnerability      | Unlike other dragons of its color, this dragon has no vulnerability. The PCs will figure that out the first time they try to use its supposed vulnerability against it.                                                                                                                                |
| 7                    | Now I’m mad!          | The first time the dragon is staggered each battle, it uses its breath weapon attack as a free action that does not count against the normal uses of its breath.                                                                                                                                       |
| 8                    | Serious threat        | Disengage checks against the dragon take a –5 penalty. When a creature fails to disengage from the dragon, it takes damage equal to double the dragon’s level.                                                                                                                                         |
| 9                    | PC-style racial power | The dragon has one of the racial powers of a player character race. The most common expressions per color are: white (halfling); black (halfling, half-orc, human, wood elf); green (dwarf, dark elf); blue (high elf, half-orc); red (half-orc, human, wood elf).                                     |
| 10                   | Raw power             | Until it is staggered, the dragon rolls 2d20 with its melee attacks and uses the higher roll.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 11                   | Damage aura           | When an enemy starts its turn engaged with the dragon, it takes damage equal to the dragon’s level (adventurer tier), double the level (champion tier), or triple the level (epic tier). The damage type is the same as the dragon’s breath weapon.                                                    |
| 12                   | More breath           | The dragon can use its intermittent breath 1d4 more times each battle. If its breath weapon isn’t intermittent (white and green dragons), the dragon gains the extra uses anyway, making it more dangerous than lesser specimens of its color.                                                         |
| 13                   | Humanoid form         | The dragon is capable of shapechanging into a humanoid form, usually of a warrior or spellcaster appropriate to its nature and usually not obviously draconic, registering as a normal humanoid. The dragon has the PC-style racial power of their humanoid form, but only while in shapechanged form. |
| 14                   | Some Unique Thing     | The dragon has an entirely unique characteristic, something akin to a player character’s one unique thing except that the dragon’s version may be relevant to combat. GM, if you don’t feel like making something up, choose an ability from the list above.                                           |

Metallic dragons also have special abilities, though they differ slightly from the chromatic dragons’ abilities.

| 6   | Murderous             | The crit range of the dragon’s melee attacks expands by 2.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 7   | Now I’m mad!          | The first time the dragon is staggered each battle, it uses its breath weapon attack as a free action that does not count against the normal uses of its breath.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 8   | Serious threat        | Disengage checks against the dragon take a –5 penalty. When a creature fails to disengage from the dragon, it takes damage equal to double the dragon’s level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 9   | PC-style racial power | The dragon has one of the racial powers of a player character race. If the dragon’s story suggests a specific power, choose that. Otherwise, use the most common expression per color: brass (gnome, halfling); bronze (dark elf, dwarf, half-orc, human); copper (dwarf, human, wood elf); silver (forgeborn, wood elf); gold (high elf, holy one, human, wood elf).                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 10  | Raw power             | Until it’s staggered, the dragon rolls 2d20 with its melee attacks and uses the higher roll.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 11  | Damage aura           | When an enemy starts its turn engaged with the dragon, it takes damage equal to the dragon’s level (adventurer tier), double the level (champion tier), or triple the level (epic tier). The damage type is the same as the dragon’s breath weapon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 12  | More breath           | The dragon gains a +5 bonus to saves to regain its breath weapon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 13  | Spellbreaker          | When the dragon hits a creature with an attack, one spell effect that creature created is negated (hard save ends, 16+). Once the creature saves, the effect returns.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 14  | Shake off             | At the start of each of its turns, the dragon can roll a save against one save ends effect on it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 15  | Free to flee          | Like the PCs, the dragon can escape at any time by giving up what amounts for it to a campaign loss. If the PCs are the ones to benefit from this, they should experience this as a major victory. But the dragon is still out there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 16  | Air supremacy         | The crit range of the dragon’s attacks against flying creatures expands by an amount equal to the escalation die.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 17  | Denial                | If a PC or other creature uses an attack against the dragon that is related to an icon that the dragon also has a relationship with, the dragon gains a +5 bonus to all defenses against that attack, and it only takes damage from the attack without suffering any of its effects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 18  | Survivor              | Each time the dragon drops to 0 hit points, it can roll a save. The first save in a battle is easy (6+), the second normal, the third and subsequent saves are hard (16+). If it succeeds, the dragon stays conscious and takes no damage from the attack or effect that would have dropped it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 19  | Humanoid form         | The dragon is capable of shapechanging into a humanoid form, usually of a warrior or spellcaster appropriate to its nature and usually not obviously draconic, registering as a normal human or elf or whatever. This ability is best used for long-term dragon characters that make it worth the GM’s time to create a double- or triple-strength humanoid monster to represent the shapechanged form. The dragon has the PC-style racial power of their humanoid form, but only while in shapechanged form. Shapechanging is a move action. |
| 20  | Some unique thing     | The dragon has an entirely unique characteristic, something akin to a player character’s one unique thing except that the dragon’s version may be relevant to combat. GM, if you don’t feel like making something up, choose an ability from the list above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

around the target until the end of the battle or until removed
magically. A spellcaster can cast a spell that targets AC or PD to
attack the haze and destroy it—the haze has 1 HP and an AC/PD of 22. The
GM is encouraged to play fast and loose with physics here: the mist can
be burned, condensed/frozen, blown away, absorbed, transmuted, etc. At
the GM’s discretion, there may be physical ways to remove the haze, but
it should require a hard DC.</p>

<p><strong>C: Nightmare breath +12 vs. MD (1d3 nearby or faraway
enemies)</strong>—60 negative energy damage, and the target becomes a
living shadow (hard save ends, 16+)</p>
<p><em>Living shadow:</em> While a living shadow, the target can’t
physically interact with or gain aid from companions or aid them
(including healing, bonuses, and effects) but is otherwise “normal”.</p>
<p><em>Limited use:</em> 1/battle, but the ability recharges when the
dragon is staggered. If it hasn’t already made a <em>nightmare
breath</em> attack when it becomes staggered, the dragon makes the
attack as a free action and then the breath recharges.</p>
<p><em>Made of shadow:</em> The shadow dragon perceives the invisible,
is unaffected by the <em>blur</em> spell, and ignores illusions. Rogues
attempting to <em>shadow walk</em> near a shadow dragon end up in the
dragon’s belly (save ends). While there, they are helpless and take 2d12
damage at the start of each of their turns until they save and fall back
out of shadow.</p>
<p><em>Shadowy escalation:</em> When in poorly lit areas of shadow, the
dragon adds the escalation die to its attack rolls. Complete darkness or
bright daylight negates the ability.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p><em>Shadow illusions:</em> As a standard action, the dragon can
appear to be humanoid, usually disguising itself as an unthreatening old
man in a cloak (DC 35 to detect). Daylight will show the illusion for
what it is—an insubstantial dragon. Dragons with a <em>Book of Many
Faces</em> will have perfect humanoid disguises. Dropping the illusion
is a free action.</p>
<p><em>Shadowy phasing:</em> When the escalation die is even, natural
odd attack rolls against the dragon automatically miss. When the
escalation die is odd, natural even attack rolls against the dragon
automatically miss. Attacks that deal holy damage ignore this
ability.</p>
<p><u>On Holy Ground</u></p>
<p>While on “holy ground” such as a temple or consecrated shrine, all
hard saves against shadow dragon effects become normal saves. As a
standard action, a cleric who invokes the gods can produce a similar
anti-shadow effect in the nearby area until the start of their next
turn, or they can turn hard saves against shadow dragon abilities to
easy saves if that area is already on holy ground. Shadow dragons try to
avoid holy ground, and shadow thieves can only enter it while possessing
victims and will flee once the possession ends. It’s up to the GM what
counts as “holy ground” in their game.</p></td>

<p><em>Natural 16+:</em> The target takes 20 negative energy damage, and
the shadow thief can make a <em>shadow possession</em> attack as a free
action (but see <em>group ability</em>).</p>
<p><em>[Group ability]</em> <strong>C: Shadow possession +13 vs. MD (one
enemy hit by <em>shadow strangulation</em>)</strong>—The shadow thief
“crawls inside” the target. The target is confused (save ends), and the
shadow thief can’t be the target of an attack or effect until it’s
forced from the target’s body when that creature saves against the
confusion effect.</p>
<p><em>Group ability:</em> For every four shadow thieves in the battle
(round up), one of them can use <em>shadow possession</em> during the
battle.</p>
<p><em>Shadow thievery:</em> The shadow thief is an extension of the
shadow dragon, not really a separate entity. When it drops to 0 hp, it
flees back to the shadow dragon and merges with it. When this happens,
if there is at least one enemy engaged with that shadow thief, the thief
chooses one enemy engaged with it. Roll a d20; on a 16+, the shadow
thief steals a random magic item from the chosen enemy as it flees back
to the dragon (but see <em>stop…thief</em> below). Stolen items are
replaced with shadowy duplicates that work until the end of the battle
then fade to nothingness. The items can be recovered if the dragon is
slain in the same battle.</p>
<p><em>Stop…thief!</em> When a shadow thief steals an item, the creature
it steals from can choose to prevent the theft, but at a cost. If the
natural d20 thievery roll was odd, the target of the thievery attempt
can choose to keep the item but become hampered (save ends) as they
wrestle with the shadow. If the natural thievery roll was even, the
target has the same choice, but it’s a hard save (16+) to end the
hampered effect.</p></td>

swirl around the targets. The swarm harasses each targeted enemy, hit or
miss. During its next turn, any enemy being swarmed this way must choose
one: Take 25 damage; OR roll twice for each attack roll it makes that
turn, taking the lower result.</p>
<p><em>[Special trigger]</em> <strong>C: Crying heavens +13 vs. MD (each
enemy in the battle)</strong>—20 ongoing damage</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> 10 ongoing damage.</p>
<p><em>Temporal manastorm:</em> The empyrean dragon’s connection to the
overworld falters, creating a storm of distorted time and magic in the
area. The dragon’s critical hit range for all attacks expands by 2 until
the end of the battle. In addition, when a target saves against the
ongoing damage from this attack, the crit range of its attacks against
the dragon expands by 1 until the end of the battle.</p>
<p><em>Limited use:</em> 1/battle, as a free action when first
staggered.</p>
<p><em>Three heads are better than one:</em> The empyrean dragon can
make two <em>gleaming bite</em> attacks as a single standard action, one
each from two heads. The third head is assumed to be maneuvering the
body around. It can choose not to make one of those attacks to end any
condition affecting it except for ongoing damage (this includes the
stunned condition, even though it technically doesn’t get an action when
stunned).</p>
<p>An enemy who scores a critical hit against an empyrean dragon can
forego the extra damage to lop off one of the dragon’s heads. If an
enemy deals 150 damage with a single attack against the dragon, the
attack will also remove a head. An empyrean dragon with two remaining
heads can make only one <em>gleaming bite</em> attack as a standard
action and can’t sacrifice that attack to remove conditions. The dragon
dies if all three heads are removed.</p>
<p><em>Intermittent breath:</em> An empyrean dragon can use <em>venom
breath</em> 1d2 + 1 times per battle, but never two turns in a
row.</p></td>

<p><em>Intermittent breath:</em> A hoardsong dragon can use <em>precise
breath</em> 1d4 times per battle, but never two turns in a row.</p>
<p><em>Known to an ounce:</em> The dragon knows where every treasure in
its hoard is located, allowing it to detect any movement or shifting of
the coins and valuables. While in its lair with its hoard, the hoardsong
dragon is immune to invisibility and ignores illusions, and creatures
attempting to hide from it take a –5 penalty to their checks.</p>

<p><em>Hoard minions:</em> The dragon’s connection to its hoard is so
strong that it has some control over the souls of those it previously
killed who owned the treasures. Once per round as a quick action, the
hoardsong dragon can summon 1d4 hoard spirits that take form by
surrounding themselves in coins, wear empty suits of armor, etc., and
defend the dragon’s hoard. Roll initiative for the minions once and use
that count for all additional minions.</p>
<p><em>The call of the hoard:</em> The connection of a hoardsong dragon
to its hoard imparts the dragon’s magic upon the hoard. Before battle,
if the PCs are able to see the hoard while the dragon speaks to them,
each PC that can hear the dragon must roll a Wisdom check. On a result
of 24 or less, that PC is charmed as per the <em>charm person</em> spell
and considers the dragon a friend. On a result of 25–29, the PC is
lulled by the dragon’s words and the sight of the hoard; if combat
occurs, the PC will be stunned during their first round. The dragon will
make a suggestion to charmed PCs to leave and bring it more treasure for
its hoard (while it prepares surprises for their return). Charmed PCs
won’t attack the dragon, but can make a normal save each round in battle
to break the charm effect (or every day outside of combat).</p></td>

spell, the dragon can roll a save; success means the spell has no effect
on the dragon. If the level of the spell is lower than the dragon’s
level, it’s a normal save (11+). Against an equal or higher-level spell,
the save is a hard save (16+). If the dragon is staggered, the save
target increases by +5 (normal becomes hard, hard becomes 21+:
impossible unless the dragon has a save bonus from some other
source).</p>
<p><em>Resist lightning 18+:</em> When a lightning attack targets this
creature, the attacker must roll a natural 18+ on the attack roll or it
only deals half damage.</p></td>
