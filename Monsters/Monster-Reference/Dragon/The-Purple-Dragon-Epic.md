<p><em>Standard abilities: Shape-shifter supreme, “No, they’re the real
Purple dragon, shoot them!”, flight, illusionary soiree. Perhaps also
not dead yet.</em></p>
<p><u>Human form</u></p>
<p><strong>Bladed fan +18 vs. AC</strong>—160 damage</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit or miss:</em> Make a second <em>bladed fan</em>
attack, and if that is a natural even roll make a third <em>bladed
fan</em> attack.</p>
<p><em>Natural odd hit:</em> The target is blown back from the Purple
Dragon.</p>
<p><em>Natural odd miss:</em> The Purple Dragon pops free and moves away
from the target (blown by the wind of the fan).</p>
<p><strong>C: One thousand delights +17 vs. MD (1d4 nearby or faraway
enemies)</strong>—Target is stuck until the start of their next turn as
their mind is assailed by pleasant images pulled from their own inner
fantasies</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit:</em> Target is confused (save ends).</p>
<p><em>Natural odd hit:</em> Target is weakened (save ends).</p>
<p><em>Aftereffect:</em> Once the target saves against weakened or
confused they take 100 psychic damage for each failed save against the
effect before they successfully passed the save.</p>
<p><u>Dragon form</u></p>
<p><strong>Filigree-gilded claws +17 vs. AC (4 attacks)</strong>—55
damage</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> 30 damage.</p>
<p><strong>C: Psychoactive breath +17 vs. MD (1d4 nearby enemies, or 1d3
faraway enemies in a group)</strong>—60 psychic damage and 50 ongoing
psychic damage</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit, once per target per battle:</em> The target is
also weakened and stuck (save once for both effects and the ongoing
damage).</p>
<p><em>Aftereffect:</em> Once the target saves against the ongoing
damage if the save was a natural odd roll the target is weakened (save
ends).</p>
<p><em>Intermittent breath:</em> The Purple Dragon can use their
<em>psychoactive breath</em> 2d4 times each combat but never two turns
in a row. They can choose to make their targets confused (save ends) on
a hit or miss with their <em>psychoactive breath</em>, but that uses up
their breath for the rest of the battle.</p>
<p><em>Wing buffet:</em> Just like the previous tiers, the <em>bladed
fan</em> attack translates in dragon form to wing buffet but with only
+17 to attack.</p>
<p>[Once per battle] Invisibility: As a quick action the Purple Dragon
becomes invisible until they next attack. Characters attacking the
Purple Dragon ‘blind’ have a 50% miss chance before rolling their
attack.</p></td>
