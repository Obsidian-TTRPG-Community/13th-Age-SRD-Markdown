save ends effect. If no allies are affected by a save ends effect, one
nearby ally can make a basic attack as a free action.</p>

<p><em>Flight:</em> Hallowed gargoyles can fly, but not gracefully.
Mid-air, they take a -2 penalty to all their defenses, and it takes them
two move actions to get airborne unless they can launch from above.</p>
<p><em>Halo:</em> The first time the hallowed gargoyle is hit by an
attack against MD, reroll the attack with a -2 attack penalty.
(Sometimes the halo sputters, so if you forget to use it the first time,
use the reroll later in the battle.)</p>

## Hallowed Gargoyle

<u>Nastier Specials for all Hallowed Gargoyles</u>

These nastier specials also apply to temple lions.

*Mirrored aggression:* Hallowed gargoyles have some ability to sense  
intentions and a larger capacity to react appropriately! PCs with a  
negative or conflicted relationship with the Religious Icon are  
vulnerable to all the hallowed gargoyles’ attacks.

*Statues, statues, everywhere:* Because they look so much like statues,  
and because most of the things that look like hallowed gargoyles are  
statues, hallowed gargoyles are capable of springing a surprise on  
inattentive PCs. When there’s a chance of such an ambush, give the PCs a  
normal skill check (DC 20 at champion-tier, DC 25 at epic tier) to  
notice the gargoyles waking and avoid being surprised (13<sup>th</sup>  
Age core rulebook, page 164).
