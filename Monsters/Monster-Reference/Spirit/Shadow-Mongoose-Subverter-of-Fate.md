<p><strong>Cloud of claws +11 vs. AC</strong>—18 damage</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit:</em> 1d12 damage to a nearby target not engaged
with the shadow mongoose.</p>
<p><strong>Subversion of fate +11 vs. MD (one target that has been hit
twice by the shadow mongoose this battle)</strong>—The shadow mongoose
steals the escalation die until the end of its next turn. While the
escalation die is stolen, all shadow mongooses and their allies use it,
and the adventurers do not.</p>
<p><em>Crit:</em> …and the shadow mongoose steals an aspect belonging to
the target. The target might lose their age, or lose part of their
appearance, or an outward personality quirk. The character’s race,
class, attributes etc. remain intact, as does their core personality and
their memories.</p>
<p><em>Quick use:</em> 1/round, as a quick action.</p>
<p><em>Shadow’s flight:</em> The shadow mongoose may become a thing of
dark smoke and shadow, flying swiftly through the air or through the
smallest cracks.</p>
<p><em>Play dead:</em> Once per battle the shadow mongoose may fake
being dead. Only magical senses and a DC 30 skill roll from the PC who
struck the ‘killing blow’ will detect that the creature is still alive.
Shadow mongooses like to fake their deaths so that they can escape
battle with their stolen icon relationships. Since shadow anatomy isn’t
entirely biological, this ability functions like fleeing the battle if
it succeeds, the PCs can go ahead and blast away at what they think is
the corpse, but they’ll be fragging the mongoose’s shadows, not the
mongoose itself.</p>
<p><em>Trader:</em> The shadow mongoose can change shape, though not
mid-battle. Shadow mongoose subverters sometimes take on non-shadowy
visages so that they can set up shop as traders, offering to take
aspects that others do not want, or selling stolen or traded aspects to
those that do desire them.</p>
<p><em>Shadow fate:</em> When the shadow mongoose dies all the aspects
that it stole return to their owners. Stolen aspects that have been
traded away also return, but slowly. The person who killed the shadow
mongoose gains a random aspect chosen by the GM.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p><em>Drop the loot:</em> The shadow mongoose flees the battle. One
nearby enemy of the shadow mongoose gains an unwanted aspect. This new
unwanted aspect is temporary, lasting only until the end of the next
game session.</p>
<p><em>Shadow dancer:</em> If the shadow mongoose doesn’t attack on its
turn it can turn into a flat shadow, and cannot be intercepted or
attacked it is moving in this form. When it returns to its normal form,
it deals double damage with its next attack, hit or miss.</p></td>
