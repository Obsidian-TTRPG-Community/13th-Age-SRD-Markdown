## Kroma Dragonic

<u>Nastier Specials for All Kroma Dragonics</u>

If you’d like to make your dragonic wyrmspawn more deadly, give them  
wings and limited flight. Or if your dragonics have the blood of the  
mighty wyrms flowing through them (or the magic of dragons has worn off  
on them), consider giving some of them a random dragon ability.

*Limited flight:* At the start of each turn, roll a d6. If the result is  
less than or equal to the escalation die, the dragonic gains flight as a  
move action during its turns thanks to a pair of wings it unfurls from  
its back. The flight tends to be more power-flapping or gliding from one  
place to another rather than hovering. Flamewings who also have limited  
flight prefer to use their burning wings to fly in combat wherever  
possible, resorting to their physical wings only if needed.

*Blood of the wyrm:* This dragonic displays traits of its forebears, the  
mighty wyrms. Roll a d10 and consult the random dragon ability table, or  
choose one of the first ten options that looks likely to shape the story  
or battle.
