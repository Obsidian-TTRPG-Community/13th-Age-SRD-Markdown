<p><em>Change shape:</em> An attached eidolon can look like any medium-
or small-sized normal beast or humanoid creature. It generally changes
shape to blend in, choosing to look like a pet or attractive humanoid
companion of the one who summoned them.</p>
<p><em>Flight:</em> Attached eidolons can fly, but not well. If their
current shape doesn’t have wings, it can grow some as a move action.</p>
<p><em>Terrifying glare:</em> Twice per battle as a quick action; the
eidolon can terrify each enemy engaged with it that has 30 hp or fewer
(they are dazed and unable to use the escalation die until the end of
their next turn) as a fear effect.</p>
<p><u>Aid Another</u></p>
<p>The eidolon’s presence can provide aid to its allies, especially the
one to which it’s attached. Once per round as a quick action, one of the
eidolon’s nearby allies can gain one of the following benefits:</p>
<p><em>Winning ways:</em> The ally’s crit range expands by 1 until the
end of the battle.</p>
<p><em>Wide smile:</em> The ally gains a +1 attack bonus until the end
of the battle.</p></td>
