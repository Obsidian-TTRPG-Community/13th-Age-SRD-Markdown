<p><strong>Cloud of claws +9 vs. AC</strong>—7 damage</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit:</em> After the current battle is over, the next
time this day that the target takes ongoing damage, the shadow mongoose
gets to make a <em>destruction of fate</em> attack against the
target.</p>
<p><em>[Triggered action]</em> <strong>R: Destruction of fate +9 vs. MD
(one target that has been hit twice by the shadow mongoose this
battle)</strong>—The target rolls their icon dice, and any that come up
1-4 the shadow mongoose steals until the end of the day. At the start of
the next day the target rolls a save (11+) for each stolen icon
relationship, on a success the icon relationship die returns to
them.</p>
<p><em>Crit:</em> …and the shadow mongoose steals an item belonging to
the target, preferably a magic one but sometimes the most vital one (a
key, a map).</p>
<p><em>Shadow’s slide:</em> The shadow mongoose can move over any solid
surface, slithering like a shadow.</p>
<p><em>Play dead:</em> Once per battle the shadow mongoose may fake
being dead. Only magical senses and a DC 25 skill roll from the PC who
struck the ‘killing blow’ will detect that the creature is still alive.
Shadow mongooses like to fake their deaths so that they can escape
battle with their stolen icon relationships. Since shadow anatomy isn’t
entirely biological, this ability functions like fleeing the battle if
it succeeds, the PCs can go ahead and blast away at what they think is
the corpse, but they’ll be fragging the mongoose’s shadows, not the
mongoose itself.</p>
<p><em>Trapper:</em> The shadow mongoose can change shape, though not
mid-battle. Shadow mongoose destroyers of fate use this ability to seem
innocuous until they are ready to strike.</p>
<p><em>Shadow fate:</em> When the shadow mongoose dies all the icon
relationship dice that it stole return to their owners. The person who
killed the shadow mongoose gains a magic item that the shadow mongoose
had stolen (though maybe not one that it had stolen from the party).</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p><em>Drop the loot:</em> The shadow mongoose flees the battle. One
nearby enemy of the shadow mongoose has their icon relationships flip
positive to negative and vise-versa (conflicted relationships are
unaffected). This relationship inversion is temporary, lasting only
until the end of the next game session.</p>
<p><em>Shadow dancer:</em> If the shadow mongoose doesn’t attack on its
turn it can turn into a flat shadow, and cannot be intercepted or
attacked it is moving in this form. When it returns to its normal form,
it deals double damage with its next attack, hit or miss.</p></td>
