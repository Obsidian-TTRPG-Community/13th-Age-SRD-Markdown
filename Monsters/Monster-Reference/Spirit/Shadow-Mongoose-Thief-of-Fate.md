<p><strong>Tenebrous claws +13 vs. AC</strong>—24 damage</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit:</em> Make a second <em>tenebrous claws</em>
attack as a free action.</p>
<p><strong>Theft of fate +13 vs. MD (one target that has been hit twice
by the shadow mongoose this battle)</strong>—The shadow mongoose steals
an icon die from the target. The target may not use the stolen icon die,
until the shadow mongoose gives it back, or the shadow mongoose
dies.</p>
<p><em>Crit:</em> …and the relationship that the adventurer has with
that icon flips from positive to negative or negative to positive.
Conflicted relationships are unaffected.</p>
<p><em>Quick use:</em> 1/round, as a quick action.</p>
<p><em>Shadow speed:</em> As a move action the shadow mongoose may
teleport into engagement with a target that it missed the previous
round.</p>
<p><em>Play dead:</em> Once per battle the shadow mongoose may fake
being dead. Only magical senses and a DC 35 skill roll from the PC who
struck the ‘killing blow’ will detect that the creature is still alive.
Shadow mongooses like to fake their deaths so that they can escape
battle with their stolen icon relationships. Since shadow anatomy isn’t
entirely biological, this ability functions like fleeing the battle if
it succeeds, the PCs can go ahead and blast away at what they think is
the corpse, but they’ll be fragging the mongoose’s shadows, not the
mongoose itself.</p>
<p><em>Trickster:</em> The shadow mongoose can change shape, though not
mid-battle. Shadow mongooses sometimes join adventuring parties as
helpful hirelings, love interests, or local guides to repeatedly steal
icon relationships from adventurers.</p>
<p><em>Shadow fate:</em> When the shadow mongoose dies all the icon
relationship dice that it stole return to their owners. The person who
killed the shadow mongoose gains 1d3 ‘5’ icon dice results with a random
icon that they do not have a relationship with OR a 6 with the Trickster
Icon if they do not have a relationship with him (roll 1d3 for
relationship type: 1= Negative, 2= Conflicted, 3= Positive).</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p><em>Drop the loot:</em> The shadow mongoose flees the battle. One
nearby enemy of the shadow mongoose gains an unwanted icon relationship
worth 1d3 icon dice. This new relationship is temporary, lasting only
until the end of the next game session.</p>
<p><em>Shadow dancer:</em> If the shadow mongoose doesn’t attack on its
turn it can turn into a flat shadow, and cannot be intercepted or
attacked it is moving in this form. When it returns to its normal form,
it deals double damage with its next attack, hit or miss.</p></td>
