<td><p>Initiative: +15</p>
<p><strong>Crushing claws +15 vs. AC (2 attacks)</strong>—70 damage</p>
<p><em>Both attacks hit the same target:</em> The chuul grabs the
target.</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> 35 damage.</p>
<p><strong>Crippling tentacles +15 vs. PD</strong>—The target is
weakened (hard save ends, 16+)</p>
<p><em>First failed save:</em> The target is hampered and weakened (hard
save ends both, 16+).</p>
<p><em>Second failed save:</em> The target is instead helpless (hard
save ends, 16+).</p>
<p><em>Quick use:</em> This attack only requires a quick action when
used against an enemy the chuul is grabbing.</p>
<p><em>I hate you all:</em> Once per round when the chuul is engaged
with one or more enemies and is the target of an attack, it can try to
interpose one of those enemies between itself and the attack as a free
action after seeing the attack roll. That enemy rolls a normal save; on
a failure, it becomes the target of the attack instead of the chuul. If
the chuul tries to interpose an enemy it’s grabbing, the save is hard
(16+) instead.</p>
<p><em>Resist psychic 16+:</em> When a psychic attack targets this
creature, the attacker must roll a natural 16+ on the attack roll or it
only deals half damage.</p>
<p><em>Water-breathing:</em> Chuuls swim well and can breathe
underwater, though they prefer not to.</p>
<p><u>Chuul Mutations: Choose ONE</u></p>
<p><em>Exposed brain nightmare aura:</em> When an enemy is engaged with
the chuul at the start of its turn, that creature must roll a normal
save; on a failure, it’s hampered (easy save ends, 6+).</p>
<p><em>Extra claw:</em> The mutant chuul can make three <em>crushing
claws</em> attacks instead of two. If two of the attacks hit the same
target, the chuul grabs it.</p>
<p><em>Oversized claw:</em> When the chuul rolls a natural even hit with
<em>crushing claws</em>, it deals 120 damage instead of 70.</p>
<p><em>Venom spit:</em> The chuul gains a <em>venom spit</em>
attack.</p>
<p><strong>R: Venom spit +16 vs. PD (1d3 nearby or faraway enemies in a
group)</strong>—40 poison damage</p>
<p><em>First attack is a natural even roll:</em> The chuul can make a
second <em>venom spit</em> attack against the same group as a free
action.</p>
<p><em>Whipping tentacles:</em> The <em>crippling tentacles</em> attack
is now a close attack against 1d3 enemies in a group.</p></td>
