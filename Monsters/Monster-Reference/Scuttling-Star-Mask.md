<p><strong>Strangling tentacles +9 vs. PD</strong>—5 damage, and 5
ongoing damage (damage also ends if the target is no longer engaged with
the star-mask)</p>
<p><em>[Group ability]</em> <strong>C: Suffocating thoughts +10 vs. MD
(one nearby enemy)</strong>—Until the end of the battle, if the target
drops to 0 hp or below, it rejoins the fight as a 5<sup>th</sup> level
star-mask cultist. Converted player character star-mask cultists can be
freed from their masks as a standard action by a character next to them.
Use cultist stats and ignore the PC’s hit points and normal attacks and
powers; some hand waving may be necessary here, be forgiving if the PCs
spend serious resources to deal with the problem during combat.</p>
<p><em>Group ability:</em> For every four star-masks in the battle
(round up), one of them can use <em>suffocating thoughts</em> once
during the battle.</p>
<p><em>Leap:</em> When the escalation die is odd, the star-mask can move
and engage a nearby enemy as a quick action.</p></td>
