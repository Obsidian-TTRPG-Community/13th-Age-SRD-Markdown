<p><em>Natural even hit:</em> The centaur ranger can take an additional
move action this turn.</p>
<p><em>Natural 16+:</em> The centaur ranger can make a second (but not a
third) <em>longbow</em> attack this turn as a free action.</p>
<p><em>Moving combatant:</em> The centaur ranger gains a +4 AC bonus
against opportunity attacks and only takes half damage from opportunity
attacks that hit it. When an enemy makes an opportunity attack against
it and misses, that enemy takes 10 damage from a counter-attack.</p>
<p><em>Terrain familiarity:</em> Once each round when the escalation die
is odd, the centaur ranger can make use of the area’s terrain to its
advantage as a free action. It can choose either to gain a +2 attack
bonus for its attacks that turn, or to gain a +2 bonus to all defenses
against the next attack that targets it by using a flashy or tricky
maneuver (leaping off a rock over an enemy, stirring up a hornet’s nest
near an attacker, etc.). The target of its attack or a creature
attacking it when it attempts this stunt rolls a normal save; on a
success, the bonus is negated.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p><strong>R: Pinning volley +11 vs. AC (2 attacks)</strong>—8 damage,
and the target is hampered until the end of its next turn</p>
<p><em>Natural 18+:</em> The target is stuck (save ends) instead of
hampered.</p>
