<p>Vulnerability: fire</p>
<p><strong>Icicle staff +14 vs. AC</strong>—20 damage, 20 cold damage,
and the sorceress can make an <em>icy delusions</em> attack against the
target as a free action</p>
<p><strong>R: Winter wind +14 vs. PD</strong>—55 cold damage</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit or miss:</em> The sorceress can make an <em>icy
delusions</em> attack against the target as a free action.</p>
<p><em>[Special trigger]</em> <strong>C: Icy delusions +14 vs. MD (one
enemy)</strong>—At the start of each round, the target loses 2d6 points
from their initiative count as they slowly freeze from the inside out
(save ends)</p>
<p><em>Frozen flesh:</em> When a creature is reduced to 0 initiative or
lower from <em>icy delusions</em>, it becomes delusional and frozen and
must choose one condition that will affect it: confused (hard save ends,
16+); OR stunned (save ends). After saving, the creature rerolls its
initiative.</p>
<p><em>Ice summoner:</em> Once per round as a free action, the giant can
make an <em>ice wall</em> attack to conjure forth a wall of ice that
stops one enemy's movement or ranged attack. The giant can’t use this
ability to target creatures making fire attacks or wielding weapons that
deal fire damage.</p>
<p><strong>C: Ice wall +14 vs. PD (one moving enemy or ranged
attacker)</strong>—The target stops its movement or loses its ranged
attack that turn, and the wall of ice remains until the end of the
battle (GM’s choice on its size, but it shouldn’t be too large or thick;
normal DC to break through it)</p>
<p><em>Ancient cold:</em> While battling one or more frost giants, there
is only a 50% chance that the escalation die increases at the start of
the round.</p>
<p><em>Resist cold 16+:</em> When a cold attack targets this creature,
the attacker must roll a natural 16+ on the attack roll or it only deals
half damage.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p><em>Ice armor:</em> The ice sorceress has <em>resist damage 16+</em>
unless the attack deals fire damage.</p></td>
