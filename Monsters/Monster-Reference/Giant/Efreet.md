<p>Vulnerability: cold (only while staggered)</p>
<p><strong>Blade of the perfect warrior +15 vs. AC (3
attacks)</strong>—35 damage</p>
<p><em>Natural 5, 10, 15, 20:</em> Each nearby enemy takes 20 fire
damage.</p>

<p><em>Natural 5, 10, 15, 20:</em> The target loses all fire resistance
until the end of the battle and is hampered (save ends).</p>
<p><em>Flight:</em> Efreet don’t fly as well or as quickly as djinn, but
they are able to get around okay.</p>
<p><em>Grant-a-wish:</em> A PC whose attack drops an efreet to 0 hp
gains the equivalent of an extremely favorable roll of 6 with an icon
relationship die with an icon of the PC’s choice that the PC already has
a positive or conflicted relationship with. Treat this advantage as if
it came from a positive relationship. The GM is encouraged to treat this
result with the utmost benevolence and compassion.</p>
<p><em>Resist fire 18+:</em> When a fire attack targets this creature,
the attacker must roll a natural 18+ on the attack roll or it only deals
half damage.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p>If you want an efreet to be even tougher, add a nastier special
depending on which icon or icons the efreet is presently working for.
The abilities represent the innate magic of the genie being channeled
through the influence of the icon.</p>
<p><u>Magic or Religious Icon</u></p>
<p><em>Reinforced aura/spirit:</em> The efreet gains a +1 bonus to MD
and has no vulnerability to cold while staggered.</p>
<p><u>Zealous Icon</u></p>
<p><em>Spiky bits:</em> When an enemy makes a melee attack against the
efreet and misses, it takes 2d20 damage.</p>
<p><u>Demonic Icon</u></p>
<p><em>Demonic taint:</em> The efreet gains a random demonic feature
from the Demonic Ability table.</p>
<p><u>Underground or Undead Icon</u></p>
<p><em>Stone slumbers:</em> When the escalation die is 4+ at the start
of a round, reset the escalation value by rolling it.</p>
<p><u>Graceful or Draconic Icon</u></p>
<p><em>Energy transformation:</em> The efreet can choose to deal
lightning damage instead of fire damage with its attacks.</p>
<p><u>Leader Icon</u></p>
<p><em>Iconic mark:</em> While not staggered, the efreet gains
<em>resist damage 16+</em> against enemies that have a positive or
conflicted relationship with the efreet’s icon.</p>
<p><u>Nature or Trickster Icon</u></p>
<p><em>Wind/Shadow form:</em> While not staggered, the efreet gains
<em>resist melee damage 16+</em>.</p>
<p><u>Brute Icon</u></p>
<p><em>Frenzied:</em> The efreet takes a –1 penalty to all defenses.
While not staggered, its crit range expands by 3.</p></td>
