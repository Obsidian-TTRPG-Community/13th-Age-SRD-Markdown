## Gibbering Mouther

<u>Abilities for All Gibbering Mouthers</u>

Gibbering mouthers have the following abilities:

*Eyes everywhere:* Gibbering mouthers can’t be ambushed or sneaked up  
on.

In addition, though gibbering mouthers are aberrations they are  
ooze-like enough that they use the ooze abilities flows where it likes  
and ooze.

*Flows where it likes:* The gibbering mouther is immune to opportunity  
attacks.

*Ooze:* The gibbering mouther is immune to effects. When an attack  
applies a condition to a gibbering mouther (dazed, hampered, weakened,  
ongoing damage, etc.), that condition doesn’t affect it.
