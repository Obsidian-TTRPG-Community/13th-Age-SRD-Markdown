<p><strong>Horns and claws +15 vs. AC</strong>—75 damage</p>
<p><em>Natural 2–5:</em> The prismatic ogre mage can use <em>prismatic
blast</em> as a free action without provoking an opportunity attack.</p>
<p><strong>Force shove +15 vs. PD (each enemy engaged with
ogre)</strong>—10 force damage, and the target pops free from the ogre
mage</p>
<p><em>Quick use:</em> This power only requires a quick action (once per
round) instead of a standard action when the escalation die is odd.</p>
<p><strong>R: Prismatic blast +15 vs. PD (1d3 nearby or faraway enemies
in a group)</strong>—Roll a d8 against each hit target to determine the
type of ray and effect</p>
<p><em>1. Red:</em> 75 fire damage; <em>Miss:</em> 40 fire damage.</p>
<p><em>2. Orange:</em> 50 damage, and the target is confused (save
ends).</p>
<p><em>3. Yellow:</em> 40 ongoing poison damage.</p>
<p><em>4. Green:</em> The target loses a recovery, and the prismatic
ogre mage heals 70 hp.</p>
<p><em>5. Blue:</em> 60 lightning damage, and make a secondary
attack:</p>
<p><strong>+15 vs. PD (one enemy near the target)</strong>—20 lightning
damage.</p>
<p><em>6. Cyan:</em> The target is stunned (save ends).</p>
<p><em>7. Purple:</em> The target is dazed and confused (save ends
both). When the target saves, it takes 40 psychic damage.</p>
<p><em>8. Magenta:</em> The target is transported into the future.
Remove that creature from play, returning it to the battle in (or near)
its previous location at the end of its next turn. No time seems to pass
for the target while it’s gone.</p>
<p><em>Resist exceptional attacks 16+:</em> When a limited attack (not
an at-will attack) targets this creature, the attacker must roll a
natural 16+ on the attack roll or it only deals half damage.</p>
<p><em>Warp:</em> The prismatic ogre mage warps reality with its
presence. Each character hit by the <em>prismatic blast</em> attack
during battle must write down one true personal trait or preference
about their character such as: “Yellow hair”, “Afraid of spiders”,
“Prefers white wine to red”, or “Tattoo of a halfling on left bicep”.
These personal traits are shuffled and randomly distributed equally by
the GM after the battle is over. Whichever trait each player receives is
now true for their character as well as for the character of the player
who wrote it down (unless there has somehow turned out to be a swap…).
These traits don’t alter game mechanics (feats, powers, backgrounds,
icon relationships, attributes, bonuses, etc.). They are personal
details that have been warped and scrambled by the prismatic ogre mage’s
magic.</p></td>
