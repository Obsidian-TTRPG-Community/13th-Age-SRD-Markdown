<u>True-Fomori Houses Nastier Specials</u>

Each of the greater fomori had many offspring, the true-fomori. While  
true-fomori are each unique you can usually tell which calde a  
true-fomori originated in.

Use the following nastier special groups when you want to summon on the  
offspring of a specific greater fomori. You can also add in some  
fomorian mutations and unclean-one abilities if you like.

<u>House of Songs</u>

These fomori sing songs that drive listeners to insanity.

*Song of the House:* When the escalation die is odd, the enemy with the  
highest MD must roll a save at the start of the round. If it fails, it’s  
confused until the end of its next turn. When the escalation die is  
even, the same effect applies to the enemy with the lowest MD. The  
fomori chooses if enemies are tied for highest or lowest MD.

*Ear-bleed:* The ears of all non-fomori creatures in the battle begin to  
bleed, and continue to do so until the end of the day. Until the next  
full heal-up, those creatures take a –4 penalty to skill checks  
involving social situations or detecting sounds.

*Discordancy:* The first time each battle the true fomori is staggered,  
each of its enemies in the battle is hampered until the end of its next  
turn.

<u>House of Eyes</u>

These fomori usually have lots of eyes, or a single prominent eye, and  
fly by hovering.

*Hovering flight:* This creature flies, its host’s unwashed and diseased  
feet hovering inches above the ground.

*Eye beam:* Once per turn as a quick action, the fomori can fire a  
powerful ray from one or more of its eyes.

**R: Eye beam +5 +fomori’s level vs. PD**—7 ongoing force damage  
(champion: 14 damage; epic: 21 damage)

*Natural 16+:* The target pops free from enemies it’s engaged with and  
can’t engage any enemies until it saves against the ongoing force  
damage.

*Eye theft:* When a creature is staggered, it begins to feel as if its  
eyes are being pulled out by an invisible force. It takes a –1 penalty  
to hit and damage. Enemies that die in the presence of this fomori do  
indeed have their eyes sucked out as the fomori absorbs the eyeballs.

<u>House of Nightmares</u>

These fomori shift their forms instinctually, constantly devolving into  
ever-more horrible creatures.

*Shifting from Nightmares:* When the true-fomori is hit by an attack  
that targets PD or MD, until the start of its next turn, the values of  
its PD and MD switch and it gains a bonus to AC equal to the escalation  
die.

*Nightmares:* After a battle with the fomori, the character with the  
lowest MD (randomly choose on a tie) has a nightmare during the  
following night, with a 50% chance that the nightmare somehow comes true  
the next day.

*Skin theft:* You know that trick with the tablecloth? When the  
true-fomori scores a critical hit, it does that to some of its target’s  
skin, and the target is stunned (save ends). Replacing the skin might  
take more than normal healing, too, and it might take a while to look  
right on a creature again.

<u>House of Spiders</u>

These true-fomori tend to have lots of legs and can control spiders,  
scorpions, ticks, and other arachnids.

*Scuttle:* The true-fomori can climb like a spider and squeeze its body  
down to scuttle swiftly under low openings.

*Bite:* Once per turn as a quick action, the true-fomori can make the  
following attack to inject acid into its victim and drink its innards.

**Draining bite +5 + fomori’s level vs. AC**—7 acid damage (champion: 14  
damage; epic: 21 damage)

*Natural 16+:* The target heals using a recovery, but the true-fomori  
gains the hit points.

*Sun-eating:* A creature staggered by this fomori can no longer see the  
sun the following day and must rely on lantern light or magical  
illumination. There is a 50% chance each day thereafter that the  
adventurer recovers and can once again see sunlight and feels its  
warmth. While a creature is unable to see or feel the healing sun,  
whenever it rolls recovery dice, it must reroll any die that has the  
maximum result (for example, a 10 on a d10).

<u>House of Colors</u>

These true-fomori have plumage or fur in unnatural madness-causing  
colors.

*Color out of time:* An enemy making a ranged attack against the  
true-fomori takes a penalty to the attack equal to the escalation die  
and can’t use the escalation die for that attack.

*Color drain:* When the true-fomori drops a creature to 0 hp or lower,  
that creature is drained of all color and can no longer perceive color.  
While under this effect, the creature takes a –4 penalty to social skill  
checks and a –1 penalty to saves. Restoring color to the creature  
requires a quest involving walking a sacred labyrinth.
