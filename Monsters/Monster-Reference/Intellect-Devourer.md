<p><strong>C: Recall trauma +8 vs. MD (one nearby enemy)</strong>—16

<p><em>Natural even hit:</em> The target can’t add the escalation die to
its attacks (save ends).</p>
<p><strong>C: Ego scourge +8 vs. MD (one nearby or faraway
enemy)</strong>—10 psychic damage, and the target must choose one: take
10 extra damage; OR lose two points (cumulative) from its highest
current background (min 0) until the next full heal-up</p>
<p><strong>C: Mind wipe +10 vs. MD (one nearby enemy per point on esc.
die)</strong>—The target can neither detect the intellect devourer’s
presence nor remember it was ever there to begin with. If no enemy in
the battle remembers the devourer is there, remove it from play. Each
nearby enemy immediately detects the devourer’s presence if it makes an
attack or if it doesn’t leave the battle by the end of its next
turn.</p>
<p><em>Limited use:</em> 1/battle.</p>
<p><em>Exploit trauma:</em> The intellect devourer’s crit range with
attacks against MD expands by 2.</p>
<p><em>Lost opportunity:</em> This creature can’t make opportunity
attacks.</p>
<p><em>Psychovore:</em> An intellect devourer remembers the current
escalation die value the first time its host body drops to 0 hit points
in a battle and gains a bonus equal to that value to all attacks and
defenses until the end of the battle.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p><em>Increased trauma:</em> Add the following extra effect trigger to
the intellect devourer’s <em>recall trauma</em> attack.</p>
<p><em>Natural 5, 10, 15, 20:</em> The target can’t cast spells until
the end of its next turn.</p></td>
