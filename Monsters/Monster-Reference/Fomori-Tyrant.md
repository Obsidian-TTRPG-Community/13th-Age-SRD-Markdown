<p><strong>Crushing embrace + 15 vs. AC</strong>—40 damage, and the
target is stuck (save ends) if the tyrant isn’t already embracing an
enemy</p>
<p><em>[Special trigger]</em> <strong>C: Skin-twisting breath +15 vs.
PD</strong>—65 poison damage</p>
<p><em>Limited use:</em> Only against a target that is stuck from its
<em>crushing embrace</em> attack.</p>
<p><strong>C: “I command you to eat your own flesh” +15 vs. MD (1d3
nearby or far-away enemies)</strong>—15 psychic damage, and 10 ongoing
psychic damage and the target is hampered (save ends both)</p>
<p><em>Crit:</em> The target is helpless instead of hampered.</p>
<p><em>Chaos aura:</em> At the start of each round roll a d6 and compare
it to the escalation die. Whichever result is highest determines the
true-fomori’s effect on local reality for that round. (If there are
multiple true-fomori in the battle, only roll for one per round.)</p>
<p><strong>1: Bleeding steel</strong>—Inanimate objects scream and
bleed.</p>
<p><strong>2–3: Creeping insanity</strong>—Each non-fomori creature
takes a –2 penalty to MD.</p>
<p><strong>4–5: Abandoned and friendless</strong>—The adventurers can’t
aid each other, communicate with each other, or otherwise count each
other as allies.</p>
<p><strong>6: Doom</strong>—The fomori and its allies use the escalation
die and the adventurers do not.</p>
<p><em>Fear aura:</em> Enemies engaged with the true-fomori who have 72
hp or fewer are dazed (–4 to attack) and cannot use the escalation
die.</p>
<p><em>Power from worship:</em> At the start of its turn, the fomori
tyrant heals 5 hp for each fomorian that can see or hear it, and also
heals 5 hp if at least one unclean-one can see or hear it. This effect
affects the fomori even if it’s dead, healing it from 0 hp.</p></td>
