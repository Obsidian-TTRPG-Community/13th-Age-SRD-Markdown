Drow may optionally include one of these abilities as nastier specials: _Drow Cruelty_ or _Poisons and Potions_.

**Drow Cruelty**

Choose one of the following abilities for all non-mook drow in a battle to have:

_Poisoner:_ When the drow scores a critical hit, it can forego damage to force the target to start making last gasp saves. On the fourth failure, the target falls unconscious (and can’t be woken normally) for 2d4 minutes.

_Take advantage of weakness:_ Whenever an enemy nearby a drow rolls a save, it takes its level in damage.

_Umbral caul:_ As long as at least one drow uses a standard action each round to maintain the supernatural darkness, each non-drow creature in the battle becomes dazed (save ends) whenever it rolls a natural 1–5 with an attack roll.

_Venomous:_ The first time each battle a drow hits with a weapon attack, the target also takes 5 ongoing poison damage.

**Poisons and Potions**

Drinking a potion, applying a poison, or using a substance requires only a quick action for a drow with one of these options. Characters who acquire any of these drow items must use a standard action to drink/apply them.

_Draft of Eschaton_ (potion): When drunk it immediately purges the body of all poisons and toxins and ends any ongoing conditions. All the drinker’s saves (including last gasp saves and death saves) automatically succeed for the rest of the battle or for five minutes. Immediately after the battle, the drinker must make a DC 30 Constitution check or be completely debilitated and unable to travel far or to fight for a day.

_Dragon Apples:_ Small ceramic spheres that explode. Make a basic ranged attack against a nearby enemy (or level + 5 for drow); on a hit, the target takes 10 ongoing fire damage.

_Midnight Tincture:_ When this glass vial is broken, the nearby area is shrouded in clinging darkness. The darkness lasts 3 rounds. Each creature in the darkness except drow takes a –4 attack penalty. The tincture can be attached to an arrow or bolt.

_Potion of Spider Climbing:_ For one battle or five minutes the drinker can climb on ceilings and walls as easily as it moves on the ground.

_Spider Venom:_ A creature hit by a melee weapon coated in the venom takes 5 ongoing poison damage when the attack roll is a natural 16+.

_Web Dust:_ Made from desiccated spiders, this dust can hold a door shut or stick an object to a wall for five minutes. Champion-tier creatures can make a DC 20 skill check to rip through something held by _web dust_ before it fully dissolves, and epic-tier creatures can rip through such objects in a round. Further applications increase the effectiveness: three applications lasts for fifteen minutes, requires 3 successful checks, and takes 3 rounds for epic-tier characters to get through.
