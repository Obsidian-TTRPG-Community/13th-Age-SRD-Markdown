## The Fomori

<u>Unclean-One Abilities</u>

Add one or two of the following abilities to humanoids to create  
cultists who worship the true-fomori (or to beasts to create corrupted  
animals).

1.  *Ugly physique:* The cultist is repulsive almost beyond  
    comprehension, but its twisted form grants it the ability to  
    withstand blows. It gains +2 to AC and +1 to PD.

2.  *Uncanny speed:* The unclean-one gains a +1d10 bonus to its  
    initiative. It has a +2 attack bonus against enemies that started  
    the battle with lower initiative scores.

3.  *Unearthly beauty:* The cultist has a perfect and unaging physical  
    body, a counterpoint to its increasingly corrupted soul. It gains +2  
    to PD and MD.

4.  *Unhealthy vigor:* When a melee attack hits the unclean-one, sores  
    and pustules on its body burst, and the attacker takes 5 acid damage  
    (champion: 10 damage; epic 15 damage).

5.  *Unhinged joints:* The unclean-one cultist can move in strange ways,  
    crawling up walls like a giant bug, skittering along the ground, and  
    so forth. It gains a +2 bonus to disengage checks.

6.  *Unholy regeneration:* When the escalation die is odd, the  
    unclean-one heals hit points equal to its level times the escalation  
    die value at the start of its turn.

7.  *Unnatural strength:* Once per battle, when the unclean-one misses  
    with an attack (but not when it fumbles), it can change it to a hit  
    and increase the damage by 2 for every point in the difference  
    between the missed result and what it needed to hit as a free  
    action. When it does, it takes 1d6 damage for every 2 extra damage  
    it deals this way. (It must deal the extra damage if it changes a  
    miss into a hit.)

8.  *Unreal scent:* Humanoid enemies that move into engagement with the  
    unclean-one must immediately roll a save or take 5 poison damage  
    (champion: 10 damage, epic 15: damage). Non-humanoid enemies  
    (including druids in beast form, those who have taken undead form  
    with the aid of necromantic spells, construct races, ooze races,  
    etc.) might be more susceptible (hard save, 16+), or less  
    susceptible (easy save, 6+), GM’s call.

All unclean-ones get the following ability

*Unreasonable master:* The true-fomori can reach into the unclean-one’s  
mind to give them visions and look through their memories. In this way  
the fomori keeps an eye on its far-flung cults, and gives guidance to  
its heralds, even speaking directly through them if it desires. Oh, and  
those visions can be instructive religious apparitions, pleasing dreams  
sent as rewards, or terrifying and painful hallucinations sent as  
punishment (or because the fomori felt like inflicting suffering).

<u>Fomorian Mutation Nastier Specials</u>

Roll on the table below if you wish. You can also give fomorians some  
unclean-one abilities (though never unearthly beauty).

1.  *Extra arm:* When the escalation die is odd, the fomorian can make  
    one extra melee attack per round as a quick action.

2.  *Extra eyes:* The fomorian has a cluster of small eyes in the back  
    of its head, a huge eye on a shoulder, a slug-like eye stalk, etc.  
    The fomorian can’t be surprised or ambushed, and it has *true sight*  
    (spells like *blur*, *invisibility*, etc. don’t work on it).

3.  *Fair is foul:* Once per turn as a free action, the fomorian can  
    make the following attack:

> **C: Evil eye +11 vs. PD (one nearby or faraway enemy, but not one  
> that has been targeted by this attack since the start of the last  
> round)**—10 ongoing damage, and the target’s skin and bones painfully  
> twist to make them hideous to behold. At the start of each day,  
> provided they receive some form of magical healing, the twisted victim  
> rolls a save with a bonus equal to their Charisma or Constitution  
> modifier (whichever is lower) to recover their original appearance.
>
> *Limited use:* Once one target has been hit by this attack, no further  
> *evil eye* attacks can be made by any fomorian this battle.

4.  *Thick skin:* +1 AC and +2 PD.
