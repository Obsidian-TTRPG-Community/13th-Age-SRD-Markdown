<p><strong>Fly-by talons +13 vs. AC</strong>—60 damage, and 10 ongoing
negative energy damage (hard save ends, 16+)</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit or miss:</em> The phoenix may move again this
turn as a quick action if it has already made a flying move on its
turn.</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> The void phoenix can use a <em>void calling</em>
attack as a quick action, either this turn, or on its next turn.</p>
<p><em>[Usually special trigger, but also possible as a standard
action]</em> <strong>C: Void calling +13 vs. PD (1d3 nearby or faraway
enemies in a group)</strong>—35 negative energy damage</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit:</em> Target is dazed (save ends). Target takes
10 negative energy damage each time it fails the save.</p>
<p><em>Flight:</em> The void phoenix can fly amazingly well for a
creature that is turning itself spiritually inside out.</p>
<p><em>Void aura:</em> Enemies that end their turns engaged with the
void phoenix must attempt an easy save (6+). If the save fails, they’re
dazed until the end of their next turn.</p>
<p><em>Resist fire and negative energy 16+:</em> When a fire attack or
negative energy attack targets this creature, the attacker must roll a
natural 16+ on the attack roll or it only deals half damage.</p>
<p><em>Spectacular effects:</em> When the phoenix is dealt a critical
hit, it must roll an easy save (6+). If the save fails, the phoenix
drops to 0 hit points; see the <em>reborn in void</em> ability
below!</p>
<p><em>Reborn in void:</em> Whenever the phoenix drops to 0 hit points,
roll a d20 and add the escalation die. For each time this void phoenix
has rolled its <em>reborn in void</em> ability earlier this battle,
subtract 10 from the roll. For example, a void phoenix making its second
<em>reborn in void</em> roll (because its first roll ended up being
20+!) when the escalation die is 6 would roll the d20 and subtract
4.</p>
<p><strong>20+:</strong> The void phoenix is immediately reborn, healing
to 120 hit points above staggered and keeps fighting!</p>
<p><strong>15–19:</strong> The void phoenix is reborn in a blast of cold
and fire and negative energy, but vaults into the overworld, removed
from the battle. On the other hand, it’s not done with the PCs! Add the
phoenix to an upcoming battle by surprise, adding it as an additional
monster not accounted for by the usual encounter-building calculations.
Add a level if you feel like it, because it’s angry.</p>
<p><strong>8–14:</strong> The void phoenix is reborn in a blast of
negative energy but wants nothing more to do with this battle. It makes
the following attack, but when the attack is over it shoots off into the
overworld so quickly that it’s a teleport effect, and does not return to
the battle, nor to the adventure.</p>
<p><strong>Void rebirth +13 vs. PD (every nearby enemy)</strong>—35 fire
and negative energy damage</p>
<p><strong>7 or less:</strong> The phoenix flares back to life somewhere
nearby in a few hours, days, months, or years. Probably not relevant to
the PCs unless they or the phoenix bear a special grudge.</p></td>
