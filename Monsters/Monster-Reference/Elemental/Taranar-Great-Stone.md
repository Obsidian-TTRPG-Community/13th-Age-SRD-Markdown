<p><strong>Stones’ might +13 vs. AC (2 attacks)</strong>—50 damage</p>
<p><em>Both attacks hit the same target:</em> The taranar smashes the
target into the ground, the target is either stuck, hard save ends (if
the ground was soft), or takes 20 damage (if the ground was hard).</p>
<p><em>Miss with both attacks:</em> The taranar ends up just pounding
the ground, and can make a follow-up <em>seism</em> attack as a quick
action.</p>
<p><strong>C: Seism +13 vs. PD (the four closest nearby or faraway
enemies)</strong>—40 damage</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> 10 damage.</p>
<p><em>Throw enemy:</em> The taranar great stone can use an enemy as a
missile weapon, making the following attack.</p>
<p><strong>Heave +13 vs. AC</strong>—60 damage, and the target is thrown
away from the taranar, and the taranar makes a thrown adventurer attack
to see if the character just tossed through the air hits anybody</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> 30 damage, and the adventurer avoids being thrown.</p>
<p><strong>Thrown adventurer +13 vs. AC (1d4 enemies in a
group)</strong>—30 damage, and the thrown adventurer slams into the
targets</p>
<p><u>Nastier Special</u></p>
<p><em>Blade breaker:</em> Once per battle when a melee weapon attack
hits the taranar and is not a crit, the attack does half damage and the
weapon breaks. Wielders of magical weapons have a choice between dealing
no damage but their weapon staying intact, or dealing normal damage but
their weapon shatters and deals 2d10 force damage to both them and the
taranar.</p></td>
