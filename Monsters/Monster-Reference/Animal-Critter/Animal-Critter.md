## Animal/Critter

For dire animal abilities, see [Dire Animals](../../Monster-Rules/Dire-Animals.md).

All bats have the following abilities:

- *Echolocation:* Bats rely on sound waves to sense their surroundings.  
  A bat can “see” in total darkness, and can detect creatures using  
  invisibility or visual illusions to hide.

- *Flight:* Small bats fly quickly and turn easily. Bigger bats fly more  
  awkwardly.

- *Wall-crawler:* A bat can climb on ceilings and walls as easily as it  
  moves on the ground.
