<p><strong>Formless fist +9 vs. PD (one enemy)</strong>—25 damage; OR if
the target is fighting a <em>psychic duel</em> (see below), it can
choose to take a –4 to penalty to its next check instead</p>
<p><em>Quick use:</em> The assassin can take 15 damage to make this
attack as a quick action (once per round).</p>
<p><strong>C: Insidious domination +11 vs. MD (one enemy)</strong>—14
damage, and the opponent is locked in a <em>psychic duel</em> with the
assassin (see below)</p>
<p><strong>C: Mind thrust +10 vs. MD (one confused enemy)</strong>—35
damage (but only 50 damage on a crit)</p>
<p><em>Exploit trauma:</em> An intellect assassin’s crit range with
attacks against MD expands by 2.</p>
<p><em>Lost opportunity:</em> This creature can’t make opportunity
attacks.</p>
<p><em>Psychovore:</em> An intellect devourer remembers the current
escalation die value the first time it becomes unhosted in a battle and
gains a bonus equal to that value to all attacks and defenses until the
end of the battle.</p>
<p><em>Psychic duel:</em> A psychic duel occurs when the intellect
assassin hits with an <em>insidious domination</em> attack against a
creature. At the start of the creature’s next turn, it must make an
Intelligence skill check and can use a background that applies to
psychic ability (if any). The result of this check determines that
creature’s status until the start of its next turn. To maintain the
psychic duel, the assassin must spend a move action each turn.</p>
<p><u>Psychic Duel Result: Status</u></p>
<p><strong>15 or less:</strong> The creature is confused until the end
of its turn. It also can’t make opportunity attacks until the start of
its next turn and takes a –2 penalty to its next psychic duel check.</p>
<p><strong>16–22:</strong> The creature is pressured—it takes a –2
penalty to attacks against any enemy except the assassin (dueling
opponent).</p>
<p><strong>23–27:</strong> The creature steadies itself and can use a
move action this turn to escape the <em>psychic duel</em>. If the
creature chooses not to (or can’t) escape the duel, it gains a +2 bonus
to its next <em>psychic duel</em> check.</p>
<p><strong>28+:</strong> As 23–27, but the creature takes advantage and
gains a +4 bonus to its next <em>psychic duel</em> check instead of +2.
In addition, the assassin takes a –2 penalty to attack rolls that target
other creatures.</p></td>
