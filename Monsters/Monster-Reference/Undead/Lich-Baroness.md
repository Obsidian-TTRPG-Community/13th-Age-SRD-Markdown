<p><strong>Crystal scepter +9 vs. AC</strong>—12 damage</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit:</em> The target is dazed (save ends).</p>
<p><strong>R: Soul blast +9 vs. PD</strong>—10 negative energy damage,
and 5 ongoing psychic damage (hard save ends, 16+)</p>
<p><strong>C: Shroud of souls +9 vs. MD (each enemy engaged with
it)</strong>—5 psychic damage, and the target takes 10 psychic damage
each time it attacks the baroness (save ends)</p>
<p><em>I drink your death save:</em> When the lich baroness scores a
critical hit, the target loses a death save until the end of the battle
(effectively, it now dies after failing three death saves, and the
effect is cumulative). In addition, the crit range of attacks by the
lich against the target expands by the escalation die.</p>
<p><em>Immortality:</em> When the lich drops to 0 hit points, it
crumbles to dust but does not die. It begins to reform near its
phylactery, taking a number of days to regain its full strength equal to
its level. If the phylactery has been destroyed, the lich dies when it
drops to 0 hit points.</p></td>
