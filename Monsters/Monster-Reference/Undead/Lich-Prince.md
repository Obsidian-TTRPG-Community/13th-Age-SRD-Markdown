<p><strong>Draining bone rod +17 vs. AC</strong>—40 damage, 60 negative
energy damage, and the target is dazed (hard save ends, 16+)</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit:</em> The target is weakened instead of dazed
(hard save ends, 16+).</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> 40 damage.</p>
<p><strong>R: Arcane blast +16 vs. PD (up to 3 nearby or faraway enemies
in a group)</strong>—50 force damage, and the target must roll a normal
save; on a failure, it loses its next move action</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit or miss:</em> Each enemy engaged with the lich
prince pops free from it as a bubble of arcane energy pushes them
away.</p>
<p><strong>C: Soul rend +17 vs. PD (each nearby enemy)</strong>—30
negative energy damage, and ghostly hands reach up from the ground and
grab the target (as they try to pull the target’s spirit out of its
body)</p>
<p><em>Ghostly grasping hands:</em> When a creature is being grabbed by
the ghostly hands, it takes 30 negative energy damage at the start of
its turn and must make a last gasp save. On the fourth failed last gasp
save, the creature’s soul is torn from it and it dies. Unconscious
creatures take a –4 penalty to their last gasp saves. Note, grabbed
creatures take a –5 penalty to disengage checks.</p>
<p><em>Limited use:</em> 2/battle.</p>
<p><em>Blink and you missed it:</em> Once per battle when an attack
would hit the lich prince, the attack misses instead and the lich
teleports to a nearby location it can see as a free action.</p>
<p><em>Heartstopper:</em> When the lich prince scores a critical hit, if
after taking damage the target still has hit points, it drops to 0 hp,
falls unconscious, and begins making death saves. When the target saves
against this effect, it regains hit points equal to the amount it had
before dropping to 0 hp (after the crit damage). In addition, the crit
range of attacks by the lich against the target expands by an amount
equal to the escalation die and the lich heals 60 hit points.</p>
<p><em>Immortality:</em> When the lich drops to 0 hit points, it
crumbles to dust but does not die. It begins to reform near its
phylactery, taking a number of days to regain its full strength equal to
its level. If the phylactery has been destroyed, the lich dies when it
drops to 0 hit points.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p><strong>C: Look upon your doom +17 vs. MD (each enemy engaged with
the lich’s allies)</strong>—The lich gains a <em>fear</em> aura against
the target until the end of the battle</p>
<p><em>Fear aura:</em> While engaged with this creature, if the target
has 120 hp or fewer, it’s dazed (–4 attack) and does not add the
escalation die to its attacks.</p></td>
