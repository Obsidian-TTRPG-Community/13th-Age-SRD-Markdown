<p><strong>Soul bite +10 vs. MD</strong>—36 psychic damage, and the
target is affected by <em>wendigo’s hunger</em> (save ends)</p>
<p><em>Wendigo’s hunger:</em> Until the target saves, roll 1d6 at the
start of each of its turns. It takes the corresponding action for its
full turn instead of its normal turn:</p>
<p><em>1–2:</em> The target takes 10 damage as it bites itself.</p>
<p><em>3–4:</em> The target makes a basic attack against its nearest or
most vulnerable ally (moving to that target if necessary).</p>
<p><em>5–6:</em> The target attacks the wendigo if it can; otherwise, it
does nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Wind claw +10 vs. PD (2 attacks)</strong>—15 damage</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit:</em> After the attack the wendigo can teleport
somewhere nearby as a free action.</p>
<p><em>Flight:</em> The wendigo can walk on the wind. It is not a
graceful flyer, but it moves as fast as the wind that carries it. Nearby
creatures can see its feet blazing with fire as it runs.</p>
<p><em>Spirit form:</em> The wendigo has <em>resist damage 16+</em> to
all damage except thunder damage. A wendigo spirit can move through
solid objects but it can’t end its movement inside them.</p>
<p><em>Unseen horror:</em> The wendigo is invisible to faraway
creatures. When the wendigo attacks, if its target couldn’t see it at
the start of its turn, the wendigo gains a +2 attack bonus that
turn.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p><em>Curse of the wendigo:</em> If a creature subject to <em>wendigo’s
hunger</em> drops itself (through biting) or an ally (with a basic
attack) to 0 hp or lower, that creature also begins making last gasp
saves. Failing the fourth last gasp save turns the creature into a
raving cannibal; it loses all its normal abilities and becomes an NPC
until the PCs find a way to restore their ally (at GM’s
discretion).</p></td>
