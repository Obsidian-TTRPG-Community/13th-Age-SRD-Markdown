<p><strong>Touch of the grave +13 vs. AC</strong>—50 cold damage, and
the target is dazed (hard save ends, 16+)</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit:</em> The target is weakened instead of dazed
(hard save ends, 16+)</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> 25 cold damage.</p>
<p><strong>R: Shadow rays +12 vs. PD (2 attacks)</strong>—35 negative
energy damage</p>
<p><em>Natural 16+:</em> The target is encased in shadows (save ends).
While under the effect, it’s weakened and takes 10 ongoing cold
damage.</p>
<p><strong>R: Empowered fireball +12 vs. PD (1d3 + 1 nearby creatures in
a group)</strong>—35 fire damage, and 10 ongoing fire damage</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit:</em> The target takes 20 ongoing fire damage
instead of 10.</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> 15 fire damage, and 5 ongoing fire damage.</p>
<p><em>Limited use:</em> 2/battle.</p>
<p><em>Thank you for the best ten years of your life:</em> When the lich
count scores a critical hit, the target loses a death save until the end
of the battle (effectively, it now dies after failing three death saves,
and the effect is cumulative). In addition, the crit range of attacks by
the lich against the target expands by the escalation die and the lich
heals 40 hit points.</p>
<p><em>Immortality:</em> When the lich drops to 0 hit points, it
crumbles to dust but does not die. It begins to reform near its
phylactery, taking a number of days to regain its full strength equal to
its level. If the phylactery has been destroyed, the lich dies when it
drops to 0 hit points.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p><strong>C: Look upon your doom +13 vs. MD (up to 3 nearby
enemies)</strong>—The lich gains a <em>fear</em> aura against the target
until the end of the battle</p>
<p><em>Fear aura:</em> While engaged with this creature, if the target
has 48 hp or fewer, it’s dazed (–4 attack) and does not add the
escalation die to its attacks.</p></td>
