<p>Vulnerability: holy</p>
<p><strong>Reaping scythe +15 vs. AC (2 attacks)</strong>—50 negative
energy damage</p>
<p><em>Both attacks hit the same target:</em> Until the end of its next
turn, the target is affected by the reaver’s <em>fear aura</em> even if
it has more than 72 hp.</p>
<p><em>Phasing:</em> While the escalation die is odd, the reaver takes
no damage and suffers no effects from attacks with natural attack rolls
less than 18+ (or 16+ for attacks that deal holy damage). It does take
full damage and effects from attacks that are able to affect it.</p>
<p>While phasing, the reaver can move but creatures can’t intercept it,
and it can travel through solid objects but not end its turn in them. In
addition, while phasing the reaver can’t attack (including opportunity
attacks) or affect the physical world except in the following way: When
an enemy starts its turn engaged with the phased reaver, it takes 25
negative energy damage.</p>
<p>The reaver can also using phasing outside of battle, but only for a
short time.</p>
<p><em>Call upon death shades:</em> Until the reaver drops to 0 hp, when
one of its living (not undead or construct) enemies or non-mook allies
rolls a death save or dies, a death shade enters the battle. Death
shades act immediately after the reaver in initiative order.</p>
<p><em>Death aura:</em> When the escalation die is 6+, all normal saves
made during the battle become hard saves (16+).</p>
<p><em>Fear aura:</em> While engaged with this creature, enemies with 72
hp or fewer are dazed (–4 attack) and do not add the escalation die to
their attacks.</p>
<p><em>Flight:</em> Reavers ignore the bonds of gravity while they’re
phasing.</p>
<p><em>Marked by death:</em> When a creature disengages or moves away
from a reaver that’s phasing, that creature is vulnerable to negative
energy until the end of its next turn.</p>
<p><em>Unholy backlash:</em> Deal 3d10 negative energy damage to any
creature that targets the gruesome reaver with an attack that deals holy
damage.</p></td>
