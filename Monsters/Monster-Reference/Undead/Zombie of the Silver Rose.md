<p><strong>Iron-hard hands +9 vs. AC</strong>—7 damage</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit or miss:</em> Both the zombie and its target
take 1d6 damage.</p>
<p><em>Hand of the fallen:</em> When a melee attack drops one or more
Silver Rose mooks, the hand of one of those zombies ends up severed from
its owner and latched onto a nearby enemy. The afflicted creature is
vulnerable to all attacks until the hand is removed, which takes a
standard action by that creature or an ally next to them.</p>
<p><em>Shot to the head:</em> When an attack drops this zombie and it
had 2, 4, or 6 hp remaining, the attack deals the same amount of damage
to another member of the mob. If this zombie has any other number of hit
points left? No hit to the head.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p><em>Curse of failure:</em> Each round, one zombie mook in the Silver
Rose mob can make a <em>curse</em> attack as a quick action.</p>
<p><strong>C: Curse +4 vs. MD (one nearby enemy)</strong>—The target is
weakened until the start of the zombie’s next turn.</p>
<p><em>Mob rule:</em> The <em>curse</em> gains an attack bonus equal to
the number of Silver Rose zombies in the battle.</p></td>
