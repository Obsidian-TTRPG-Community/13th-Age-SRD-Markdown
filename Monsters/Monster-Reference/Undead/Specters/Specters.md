## Specters

<u>Nastier Specials for all specters</u>

*Aura of loss:* The first time during a battle the specter is staggered,  
each nearby enemy with 30 hp or fewer is hampered until the end of the  
specterâ€™s next turn. (9<sup>th</sup> level dread specter affects enemies  
with 60 hp or fewer.)

*Healing drain:* When an enemy engaged with a specter heals, it heals  
only half the normal hit points, and the specter heals the other half  
(round down).

*Spectral evasion:* Once per battle as a free action when an enemy  
attacks the specter, it can force the attacker to reroll the attack and  
use the result the specter prefers.
