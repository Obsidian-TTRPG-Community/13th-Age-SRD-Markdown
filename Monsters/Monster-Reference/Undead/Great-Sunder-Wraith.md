<p><strong>Shivering blade +16 vs. PD</strong>—50 negative energy
damage, or 100 negative energy damage if the target has been hit by at
least one <em>sundering</em> attack earlier in the battle</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> Negative energy damage equal to the natural attack
roll.</p>
<p><strong>C: Sundering +16 vs. PD (one nearby enemy)</strong>—60
negative energy damage, and teleport the sunder wraith into engagement
with the target</p>
<p><em>Natural even miss:</em> Teleport the sunder wraith somewhere
nearby the target, but not engaged with an enemy.</p>
<p><em>Flight:</em> Sunder wraiths fly like the world is defined however
they want it to be defined.</p>
<p><em>Ghostly:</em> This creature has <em>resist damage 16+</em> to all
damage (yes, even holy damage, and for that matter, this creature has
outgrown vulnerability to holy damage) except force damage, which
damages it normally.</p>
<p>A great sunder wraith can move through solid objects, but it can’t
end its movement inside them.</p>
<p><em>Destroyer:</em> Three times per battle when the sunder wraith
moves through a solid object like a wall, throne, door, or chest, the
object must roll a hard save. If the save fails, the object is broken.
Strongly magical objects get bonuses on the save, but err on the side of
uh-oh.</p></td>
