<p><strong>Great leeching +18 vs. PD</strong>—110 negative energy
damage, and Fallen Icon’s Shadow heals 2d6 × 10 hit points</p>
<p><em>Natural odd roll:</em> Target also takes 50 ongoing negative
energy damage.</p>
<p><strong>R: Fanged shadows +18 vs. MD (1d4 nearby
enemies)</strong>—140 psychic damage, and target is dazed (save
ends)</p>
<p><em>Natural odd miss:</em> 40 ongoing psychic damage.</p>
<p><em>Empowered by death:</em> When the last mook in a mob is slain
nearby, or when a creature drops to 0 hit points or dies in some other
fashion nearby, the Fallen Icon’s Shadow heals hit point equal to 10 ×
the creature (or mob’s) level.</p>
<p><em>Open maw:</em> When the escalation die reaches 6, the battle ends
as a campaign loss for the player characters. The first consequence of
the loss is that the Fallen Icon’s Shadow disappears and the Fallen
Icon’s Maw returns to life at some other distant location. Perhaps there
is no other terrible consequence. Perhaps that’s enough.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Special</u></p>
<p><em>Fear aura:</em> While engaged with this creature, if the target
has 144 hp or fewer, it’s dazed (–4 attack) and does not add the
escalation die to its attacks.</p></td>
