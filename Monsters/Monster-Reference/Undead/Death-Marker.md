<p><em>Target is hit by a marked for death attack for the second time
this battle:</em> Until the end of the battle, when the target tries to
spend a recovery they have to succeed at a save (11+) first. If they
fail, they haven’t used their action but can’t spend recoveries that
turn.</p>
<p><em>Target is hit for the third time this battle:</em> The save to
spend a recovery is now a hard save (16+).</p>
<p><em>Target is hit for the fourth time this battle:</em> Until the end
of the battle the target cannot spend recoveries.</p>
<p><em>Phasing flight:</em> Death markers can float on unseen winds,
moving through solid objects and creatures as though they were not
there. The death marker must still end its move on solid ground and not
inside an object or creature.</p></td>
