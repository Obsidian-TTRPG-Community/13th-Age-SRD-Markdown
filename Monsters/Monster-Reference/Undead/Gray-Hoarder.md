<p><em>Crit:</em> The target loses the use of a random heroic-tier true
magic item that the gray hoarder magically wrests away. The item can
only be retrieved as a standard action from the body of the slain gray
hoarder.</p>
<p><em>Scent of treasure:</em> The gray hoarder’s crit range expands by
the number of heroic-tier true magic items that the target is attuned
to. (Targets with more of these items are preferred prey.)</p>
<p><em>Mine forever:</em> If the gray hoarder starts its turn next to a
fallen enemy, it will spend a quick action to pick up a random magic
item or implement belonging to that enemy. The gray hoarder will then
attempt to disengage (if necessary) and move as quickly as possible from
the battle without taking opportunity attacks. (<em>Mine Forever</em> is
also triggered when acquiring an item by scoring a critical hit.)</p>
<p><u>Nastier Special</u></p>
<p><em>Necromantic resistance:</em> The gray hoarder has <em>resist
negative energy 16+</em>, as well as a +2 bonus to defenses and saves
against attacks and effects that specifically target undead.</p></td>
