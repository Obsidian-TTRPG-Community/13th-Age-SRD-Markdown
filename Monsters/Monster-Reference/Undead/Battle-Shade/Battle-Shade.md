## Battle Shade

Treat the battlefield effects that follow as a big nastier special.

### Against The Pcs

Until all battle shades have been reduced to 0 hit points, select one of the following effects at the start of each round.

-   Half-formed hands of mud and dirt reach out of the ground, grasping at the legs and feet. Make the following attack against 1d3 non-flying creatures.

-   **+7 vs PD**—The target is stuck until the start of their next turn.

-   A literal fog of war (smoke, fog, blowing dust, etc.) covers the area. Ranged attacks from non-battle shade creatures have a –4 penalty.
-   Broken and shattered weapons erupt out of the ground. Choose up to three characters in a group. Those players must roll a normal (11+) saving throw or take 2d10 damage.
-   Wild necromantic energy bursts like a geyser from the earth with a scream of pain and fear from dozens of spectral throats. Target 1d3 characters with the following attack.

-   **+6 vs MD**—4 damage and the target is dazed until the end of their next turn.

-   Blood begets blood. As the characters are beaten and injured, the accumulated pain and blood revitalizes the battlefield and the battle shades. The first time a character becomes staggered or any time one drops to 0 hit points, add a broken shade mook to the fight. Add it to an existing mob if possible.

### Counteractions

Player characters expecting to deal with battle shades can take precautions.

-   Ritual casting certain spells like the cleric's *turn undead* or an appropriate Terrain Caster spell from the druid could return the battle area to normal for the duration of the battle.

-   Players may think to try this during combat instead of beforehand. If they do so, they should make a normal (11+) saving throw at the beginning of each round. If they succeed, the battlefield effect is suppressed. If they fail, it activates like normal that turn.

-   The obvious icon relationship advantages that could help are the Religious and Undead Icons, but players may be able to justify others. A six, along with a bit of a description should nullify the battlefield effects. A five would nullify the effect but create some other complication; for example, summoning the attention of the Undead Icon’s servants!
