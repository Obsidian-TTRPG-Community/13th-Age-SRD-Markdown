<p><strong>Pincer +13 vs. AC</strong>—45 damage</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit:</em> The demon can grab the target as long as
it isn’t already grabbing a creature. The grabbed foe can’t move except
to teleport, pop free, or attempt to disengage, and disengage attempts
take a –5 penalty unless the creature hit the glabrezou with an attack
that turn.</p>
<p>The glabrezou gains a +4 attack bonus against any enemy it is
grabbing.</p>
<p><strong>R: Painbolt +13 vs. MD (one nearby or faraway
creature)</strong>—70 psychic damage</p>
<p><strong>C: Hellfire +13 vs. PD (1d3 nearby enemies in a group
<em>and</em> any glabrezou allies engaged with those
enemies)</strong>—50 fire damage</p>
<p><em>Mirror images:</em> At will, as a move action, a glabrezou can
create multiple images of itself that make it harder to target. The next
time an attack would hit the glabrezou, the attacker has to roll 11+
with another d20 roll: success indicates a hit; failure is a miss that
hits one of the mirror images instead, dealing no miss damage to the
glabrezou but dispelling all the images.</p>
<p>Once the glabrezou is staggered, it takes 2d10 damage whenever it
uses mirror image, so movement or escape start registering as
alternatives.</p>
<p><em>Power word stun:</em> Once per day as a free action, the
glabrezou can utter a word of power, canceling a single action just
taken by a nearby creature with fewer hit points than the
glabrezou—whether it was casting a spell, healing an ally, or whatever.
The GM can see the results of the action, such as a die roll, before
deciding whether to use the power word.</p></td>
