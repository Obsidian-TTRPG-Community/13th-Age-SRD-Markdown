## Briar Elf

<u>Environmental Effects</u>

Before the battle, roll a d4 to determine which environmental effect  
will show up during the fight. Then roll a d3 for the minimum escalation  
die value that triggers the effect at the start of the round and stays  
in effect the rest of the battle.

In the unlikely event that PCs have managed to find or lure briar elves  
outside the briar elf’s forested places of power, these effects probably  
wouldn’t apply.

<u>Humanoid Briar Elves</u>

**1. Snares**—Enemies who take more than two actions on their turn while  
on the ground must save (11+) or be whipped into mid-air by a snare trap  
and hung upside-down (stuck & –2 attack penalty), it is a standard  
action to free oneself or an ally. (GM: Choose how many snares you want  
set before the fight, probably the number of PCs plus or minus 1.)

**2. Pit traps**—The briar elves have created spike-lined pits disguised  
with forest-floor litter. If you roll a natural 1–5 on d20 roll you must  
save (11+) or become stuck (move action to end) and take your level × d6  
damage.

**3. Blowdarts**—More briar elves are lurking on the edge of the fight,  
just out of sight. If a PC rolls lower than the escalation die value on  
any natural d20 roll they take poison damage equal to their level.

**4. Gruesome display**—The whirl of battle has revealed some fresh  
corpses desecrated by the briar elves and impaled in the trees. Story  
consequences are best here: it can be someone the PCs cared about.

<u>Plant Briar Elves</u>

**1. Grasping grasses**—Disengage checks by non-plant creatures and  
non-briar elves take a –5 penalty.

**2. Cutting leaves**—Adventurers must save (11+) when they move or take  
damage equal to twice their level.

**3. Crushing vines**—Any adventurer who doesn’t move on their turn  
takes their level in damage.

**4. Thorny plants**—Each time an adventurer becomes staggered they also  
take damage equal to their level times the escalation die value.

<u>Undead Briar Elves</u>

**1. Whispers of the past**—PCs have a –2 penalty to MD and PD, as  
overlapping ghostly whispers cause pain and anxiety.

**2. Ghostly terrain**—On rounds when the escalation die is odd the PCs  
are stuck, unable to move due to ghost trees that suddenly block their  
paths.

**3. Spectral hands**—PCs take a –1 penalty to attack rolls, as ghostly  
thorn-pierced hands grab at them.

**4. Fearful destiny**—PCs who could normally resist fear effects cannot  
do so for the duration of this battle. PCs who cannot normally resist  
fear take a –2 penalty to their saves whenever they are affected by  
fear.
