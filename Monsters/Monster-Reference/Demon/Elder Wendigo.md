<p><strong>Icy claws +14 vs. PD (3 attacks, each against a different
nearby enemy)</strong>—50 cold damage</p>
<p><em>Frostburn:</em> If all three attacks hit, each nearby enemy takes
4d10 fire damage.</p>
<p><strong>C: Flame blizzard +14 vs. PD (1d6 nearby or faraway enemies,
but not more than esc. die)</strong>—90 fire or cold damage (GM
choice)</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit:</em> The target is hampered until the end of
its next turn.</p>
<p><strong>C: Horrific gaze +14 vs. MD (one nearby or faraway
enemy)</strong>—120 psychic damage, and the target is confused (save
ends)</p>
<p><em>Fourth failed confusion save:</em> The target slips into madness
and becomes a cannibal cultist or wendigo or some other terrible
demon-thing of the GM’s or player’s choice in 2d10 hours.</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> 60 psychic damage.</p>
<p><em>Flight:</em> The elder wendigo can walk on the wind. It is not a
graceful flyer, but it moves as fast as the wind that carries it.</p>
<p><em>Swirling snow and fog and flame:</em> The elder wendigo gains a
+5 bonus to all defenses against attacks by faraway enemies.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p><em>Force of disruption:</em> When the elder wendigo scores a
critical hit against a target or drops a target to 0 hp or lower, that
creature must permanently change one of its icon relationship points to
a relationship with a different icon—one of a few that the GM chooses.
Alternatively, a point the character already has with one of those icons
changes to involve another icon (of the PC’s choice).</p>
<p><em>The demon stares back:</em> Once per round when a nearby or
faraway enemy attacks the elder wendigo and rolls a natural odd miss,
the wendigo can make a <em>horrific gaze</em> attack against that
attacker as a free action.</p></td>
