<p><strong>Headbutt +8 vs. AC</strong>—18 damage, or 24 damage if the
horned azinth first moves before attacking an enemy it was not engaged
with at the start of its turn</p>
<p><em>Natural blurring:</em> Attacks against the horned azinth calf
have a 20% miss chance. An attacker must roll the miss chance before the
attack roll. In addition, the azinth is nearly invisible while standing
still or slowly grazing, as it blends in with its surroundings.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Special</u></p>
<p><em>Protect the young:</em> Each horned azinth adult gains a +1
attack bonus during a battle that includes one or more calves, +2 if any
calves are attacked, and +4 if any calves are killed!</p></td>
