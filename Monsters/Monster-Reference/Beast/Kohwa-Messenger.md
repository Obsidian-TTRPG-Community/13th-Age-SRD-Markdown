<p><strong>Jaws of steel +9 vs. AC</strong>—30 damage</p>
<p><strong>R: Piercing gaze +9 vs. PD</strong>—24 lightning damage</p>
<p><em>Natural odd roll:</em> Each time the kohwa messenger makes a
natural odd roll when using this attack, it can immediately make another
<em>piercing gaze</em> attack roll against a different target it has not
already targeted this turn.</p>
<p><strong>C: Judgment of the gods +11 vs. PD (1d4 nearby
enemies)</strong>—40 psychic damage</p>
<p><em>Natural roll above Wisdom:</em> The target is dazed (normal save
ends).</p>
<p><em>Limited use:</em> 1/battle while staggered.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p><em>Invocation of the gods’ protection:</em> Once per battle, as a
quick action, the kohwa messenger can invoke the protection of their
unknown gods. Once the invocation has been made, at the start of each of
the messenger’s turns, roll 1d6. As long as the roll is equal to or less
than the escalation die, critical hits against the messenger and its
allies only inflict normal damage (although they do still trigger the
kohwa enforcer’s <em>acid rain</em> attack, if appropriate). As soon as
the roll fails, the protection lapses.</p>
<p><strong>R: Implacable dread +11 vs. MD</strong>—The target is
weakened (normal save ends). During the next round, if the target is
unengaged, it takes no action other than to move away from the
messenger. If engaged, then the target’s first action is to attempt to
disengage from its foe, moving away if successful. If the target fails
the disengage check, they use their second action to move away, inviting
opportunity attacks</p>
<p><em>Limited use:</em> Cannot be used until the escalation die reaches
4+.</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> The target develops a deep and abiding mistrust of all
kohwa.</p></td>
