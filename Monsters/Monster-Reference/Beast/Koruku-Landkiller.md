<p><strong>Thrashing tail +13 vs. AC (one nearby enemy)</strong>—80
damage</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> 40 damage.</p>
<p><em>First miss:</em> The koruku landkiller makes a second
<em>thrashing tail</em> attack against a different target.</p>
<p><em>Natural 1-5 on either attack:</em> The koruku landkiller regains
its <em>stolen magic</em> attack if it’s expended.</p>
<p><strong>Earth-gouging plates +13 vs. PD (2 attacks)</strong>—55
damage</p>
<p><em>Escalating saves:</em> The koruku landkiller adds twice the
escalation die to its saves.</p>
<p><em>Stolen magic:</em> Once per battle as a standard action, a koruku
landkiller can make one of the following magical attacks. The first five
attacks can add the escalation die when rolled against a target that has
an icon relationship with the icon the power has been stolen from! Feel
free to roll a d6 if you don’t want to spend time choosing between
attacks. (If its <em>thrashing tail</em> attack roll allows the
landkiller to regain <em>stolen magic</em>, it doesn’t have to choose
which magical attack it will use until it actually uses the attack.)</p>
<p><strong>C: Flame of the Magic Icon +13 vs. PD (1d3 nearby or faraway
enemies in a group)</strong>—114 fire damage</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit:</em> One nearby koruku servitor can make a
<em>wild magic blast</em> attack (fire damage) as a free action.</p>
<p><strong>C: Snare of the Nature Icon+13 vs. PD (1d3 nearby enemies in
a group)</strong>—90 damage and the target is stuck (normal save

attack bonus against stuck targets on their next turn.</p>
<p><strong>C: Roar of the Brute Icon +13 vs. MD (1d4 nearby
enemies)</strong>—90 thunder damage, and koruku servitors gain a +4
attack bonus against the target on their next turn</p>
<p><strong>C: Treachery of the Draconic Icon +13 vs. MD (1d3 nearby
enemies)</strong>—80 psychic damage and the target is confused (normal
save ends)</p>
<p><em>Natural 16+ hit:</em> Add a cumulative +2 to the defenses of all
koruku servitors until the end of the servitors’ next turn.</p>
<p><strong>C: Storm of the Zealous Icon +13 vs. AC (1d3 nearby
enemies)</strong>—114 damage</p>
<p><em>Natural 16+ hit:</em> All nearby koruku servitors gain a +4
