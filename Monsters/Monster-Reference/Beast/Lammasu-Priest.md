<p><em>Invocation of the world unseen:</em> Once per battle, the lammasu
priest can make this invocation as a quick action. At the start of each
of the lammasu priest’s turns until the roll succeeds, roll a d4. If the
roll is less than or equal to the escalation die, each nearby enemy is
hampered (easy save ends, 6+).</p>
<p><em>Invocation of the highest court:</em> Once per battle, the
lammasu priest can make this invocation as a quick action if it has used
<em>invocation of the world unseen</em>. At the start of each of the
lammasu priest’s turns, roll a d8. If the roll is less than or equal to
the escalation die, the lammasu can make an <em>overworld’s rebuke</em>
attack as a free action that turn.</p>
<p><em>[Special trigger]</em> <strong>C: Overworld’s rebuke +13 vs. PD
(one nearby enemy)</strong>—25 holy or lightning damage, and the target
can’t move to engage an enemy until the end of its next turn (it can
move if it doesn’t engage)</p>
<p><em>Natural even miss:</em> Half damage.</p>
<p><em>Refuge of stone:</em> When the lammasu fails a save, it becomes a
creature of living stone until the end of its next turn. While made of
living stone, the lammasu priest gains <em>resist damage 16+</em> to all
attacks against AC and PD. If it’s flying when it becomes living stone,
its magic allows it to remain in the air if it wishes.</p></td>
