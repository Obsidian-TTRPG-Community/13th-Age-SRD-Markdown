<p><strong>Thrashing horn +11 vs. AC</strong>—30 damage, or 50 damage if
the horned azinth first moves before attacking an enemy it was not
engaged with at the start of its turn</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit:</em> The horned azinth adult can make a
<em>trample</em> attack as a quick action this turn.</p>
<p><strong>Trample +10 vs. PD</strong>—10 damage, and the horned azinth
pops free from the target and can move nearby.</p>
<p><em>Natural blurring:</em> Attacks against the horned azinth adult
have a 30% miss chance. An attacker must roll the miss chance before an
attack roll. In addition, the azinth is nearly invisible while standing
still or slowly grazing, as it blends in with its surroundings.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p><em>Increasing blurriness:</em> Increase the miss chance from the
azinth’s <em>natural blurring</em> by an amount equal to 5 × the
escalation die.</p>
<p><em>Reactive camouflage:</em> The first time this battle the azinth
is staggered, it becomes harder to detect until the end of the battle,
gaining a +4 bonus to all defenses.</p></td>
