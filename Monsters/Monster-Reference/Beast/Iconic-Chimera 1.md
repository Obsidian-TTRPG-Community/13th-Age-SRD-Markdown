<p><strong>Fangs, claws, and horns +14 vs. AC (3 attacks)</strong>—25
damage</p>
<p><em>Natural 14–15:</em> The target is dazed until the end of the
chimera’s next turn from a headbutt.</p>
<p><em>Natural 16–17:</em> The target takes 20 ongoing damage from
raking claws.</p>
<p><em>Natural 18–20:</em> The chimera can make a <em>fiery breath</em>
attack as a free action.</p>
<p><em>[Special trigger]</em> <strong>Fiery breath +14 vs. PD (up to 3
nearby enemies in a group)</strong>—3d10 fire damage</p>
<p><em>Chimerical change:</em> At the start of battle each PC rolls one
icon relationship die of their choice and one die chosen from their
relationships by the GM. A roll of 6 means the chimera has shifted in a
manner that gives it a chimerical flaw (F) that the adventurers can
exploit. A roll of a 5 indicates that the chimera gains both a flaw and
a benefit associated with that icon. A result of 1 or 2 means that the
chimera gains the icon’s chimerical benefit (B) without the flaw. Actual
benefits and flaws are up to the GM, and should reflect the icons with
which the players have relationships.</p>
<p>Magic Icon</p>
<p><strong>(B)</strong> <em>Bearded spell-eating head:</em> When a spell
attack misses the chimera, it has no miss effect and the chimera heals
40 hp.</p>
<p><strong>(F)</strong> <em>Vulnerability, melee:</em> The crit range of
melee attacks against the chimera expands by 2.</p>
<p>Zealous Icon</p>
<p><strong>(B)</strong> <em>Skin of indomitable faces:</em> When the
chimera saves against a condition, it becomes immune to that condition
until the end of the battle.</p>
<p><strong>(F)</strong> <em>Vulnerability, spells:</em> The crit range
of spell attacks against the chimera expands by 2.</p>
<p>Demonic Icon</p>
<p><strong>(B)</strong> <em>Flaming oil glands:</em> When a creature is
engaged with the chimera at the start of its turn, it takes 20 fire
damage.</p>
<p><strong>(F)</strong> <em>Overconfident predator:</em> Each time the
chimera scores a critical hit, it takes a cumulative –2 penalty to all
defenses.</p>
<p>Underground Icon</p>
<p><strong>(B)</strong> <em>Stone-studded dermis:</em> Any damage dice
that roll maximum damage against the chimera count as 1s.</p>
<p><strong>(F)</strong> <em>Stubborn beast:</em> The chimera won’t
willingly disengage from a creature engaged with it.</p>
<p>Graceful Icon</p>
<p><strong>(B)</strong> <em>Springing stag legs:</em> When the
escalation die is odd, the chimera gains an additional standard action
that turn.</p>
<p><strong>(F)</strong> <em>Overly gracile:</em> The chimera’s form is
unusually frail, and any damage dice that roll 1s against the chimera
count as 2s.</p>
<p>Leader Icon</p>
<p><strong>(B)</strong> <em>Mane of scorpion tails:</em> The chimera has
a <em>fear aura</em>: Enemies engaged with the chimera who are below 48
hit points are dazed and can’t use the escalation die.</p>
<p><strong>(F)</strong> <em>Golden fleece:</em> The chimera has
transformed itself into a form that’s gem encrusted with golden fur.
When slain it will yield 1d6 × 100 gp per adventurer in gems and
precious metals. At the GM’s say-so, knowledge of this bounty may grant
particularly mercenary characters a +1 attack bonus against the chimera
once it’s staggered.</p>
<p>Protector Icon</p>
<p><strong>(B)</strong> <em>Inferno belly:</em> When the chimera makes a
<em>fiery breath</em> attack, it can make another <em>fiery breath</em>
attack that turn as a quick action.</p>
<p><strong>(F)</strong> <em>Flammable blood:</em> When the chimera rolls
a natural odd miss with <em>fiery breath</em>, it takes 20 fire
damage.</p>
<p>Nature Icon</p>
<p><strong>(B)</strong> <em>Wild heart:</em> The chimera is constantly
evolving and changing. When an enemy rolls a natural 1–5 on an attack
roll against it, the chimera adds the escalation die to its attack rolls
until the end of its next turn.</p>
<p><strong>(F)</strong> <em>Vulnerability, poison:</em> The crit range
of poison attacks against the chimera expands by 2.</p>
<p>Undead Icon</p>
<p><strong>(B)</strong> <em>Bone plates:</em> When an enemy rolls a
natural even miss with a melee attack against the chimera, the weapon
temporarily loses all its bonuses and powers and the wielder is weakened
(save ends both).</p>
<p><strong>(F)</strong> <em>Vulnerability, holy:</em> The crit range of
holy attacks against the chimera expands by 2.</p>
<p>Brute Icon</p>
<p><strong>(B)</strong> <em>Mighty tusks:</em> As a standard action, the
chimera can make a <em>tusk charge</em> attack. It can’t make any other
attacks the same turn.</p>
<p><strong>Tusk charge +20 vs. AC</strong>—100 damage</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Limited use:</em> Once the chimera has damaged an enemy with this
attack, it can’t use <em>tusk charge</em> again until it drops an enemy
to 0 hp or lower.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>(F)</strong> <em>Too many horns:</em> The horns and tusks of
the chimera lock together at inopportune moments. When it rolls a
natural 1–5 with an attack against multiple targets, it loses any
further attacks that turn.</p>
<p>Religious Icon</p>
<p><strong>(B)</strong> <em>Eagle wings:</em> The chimera can fly like
an eagle, swooping in and out of the battle.</p>
<p><strong>(F)</strong> <em>Vulnerability, negative energy:</em> The
crit range of negative energy attacks against the chimera expands by
2.</p>
<p>Trickster Icon</p>
<p><strong>(B)</strong> <em>Poison fangs:</em> When the chimera rolls a
natural 1–5 with an attack and misses, the target takes 20 ongoing
poison damage.</p>
<p><strong>(F)</strong> <em>Bickering heads:</em> The first time each
turn the chimera hits with an attack, it rerolls the attack and takes
the lower roll.</p>
<p>Draconic Icon</p>
<p><strong>(B)</strong> <em>Draconic sinews:</em> While not staggered,
the chimera rolls 2d20 with its melee attacks and uses the higher
roll.</p>
<p><strong>(F)</strong> <em>Too many wings:</em> Whenever the chimera
moves, it rolls an easy save (6+). On a failure, it provokes opportunity
attacks from each nearby enemy.</p></td>
