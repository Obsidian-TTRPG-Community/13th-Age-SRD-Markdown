<p><em>[Special trigger]</em> <strong>C: Death from below! +14 vs. AC
(each nearby creature)</strong>—45 damage; OR 22 damage, and the target
is stunned (save ends)</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> 15 damage.</p>
<p><em>Limited use:</em> 1/battle, during the remorhaz’s first turn or
if appearing on the surface after burrowing.</p>
<p><strong>Savage bite +16 vs. AC</strong>—50 damage, 20 fire damage,
and the remorhaz grabs the target if it’s not already grabbing a
creature</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> 15 fire damage.</p>
<p><em>Burrow:</em> As the standard monster ability, except the remorhaz
only needs to roll 6+ in snow and ice.</p>
<p><em>Furnace aura:</em> When a creature is engaged with the remorhaz
(or grabbed by it) at the start of its turn, it takes fire damage equal
to 6 × the escalation die.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p><em>Bejeweled remorhaz:</em> The remorhaz has glowing “jewels” on its
armored plates. When a nearby or faraway enemy misses with an attack
against the remorhaz, that enemy chooses one: It takes 10 fire damage;
OR one piece of its non-magical equipment (something useful, but
player’s choice) melts or burns up. Adjust skill checks or stats
accordingly.</p>
<p><em>Remorhaz steamer:</em> The remorhaz is melting the ice/snow all
the time and obscuring steam rises into the air. Ranged attacks against
the remorhaz take a –2 penalty, or a –4 penalty if the attacker is
faraway.</p>
<p><em>Spiney remorhaz:</em> The remorhaz is covered in red-hot spines.
When a nearby enemy rolls a natural 1–5 with an attack roll, it takes 20
fire damage unless it has somehow protected itself from the
heat.</p></td>
