<p><strong>Devouring maw +18 vs. PD</strong>—100 damage</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit:</em> The target is swallowed whole if it’s
smaller than the worm (see below).</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> Half damage.</p>
<p><strong>Tail sting +18 vs. AC (up to 2 random nearby
enemies)</strong>—40 damage, and 40 ongoing poison damage</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> 20 damage.</p>
<p><strong>Prodigious thrash +18 vs. AC (1d4 random nearby
enemies)</strong>—50 damage</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> Half damage.</p>
<p><em>Natural 1–2:</em> The worm and any creatures it has swallowed
take 8d6 damage (but it still deals miss damage on a 2).</p>
<p><em>Limited use:</em> The worm can make this attack as a free action
if it has one enemy swallowed or less after using its standard action
during its turn.</p>
<p><em>Swallow whole:</em> While a creature is swallowed whole, it takes
10d12 acid damage at the start of its turn and is stuck, hampered, and
unable to attack or affect anything outside the worm’s stomach (and
vice-versa). Most teleport abilities don’t work because you’re hampered
<em>and</em> you can’t see the location out of the worm you want to
teleport to. There are two ways out.</p>
<p><strong>Cut your way out:</strong> Deal 80 damage to the worm with a
single attack and you can cut your way out. All edged or bladed weapons
are reduced to d6 damage dice (at most) inside the worm’s gullet, so
good luck. At least you’ll be damaging the worm attacking it from
within.</p>
<p><strong>Get upchucked:</strong> While the worm is staggered, you can
use a standard action to try and crawl out of its mouth. Roll a hard
save (16+); on a success, the worm vomits you out and spits you
somewhere nearby. The worm also vomits out all creatures it has
swallowed when it drops to 0 hp.</p>
<p><em>Burrow:</em> As the standard monster ability, but with a +5 bonus
to the check.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p><em>Resist most energy damage 16+:</em> Purple worms generate weird
energy resistances thanks to underworld radiation and their odd diets.
Roll a d8 twice, in secret, to determine what energy types the worm is
not resistant to. The PCs probably have to find out what energy works
best against the worm the hard way, though you might have mercy and
allow a DC 35 Wisdom skill check to figure out what energy types work
against the worm.</p>
<p><strong>1:</strong> acid; <strong>2:</strong> cold;

## Rakshasa

<u>Nastier Special for all rakshasas</u>

*Lockheart:* The first time a rakshasa is dropped to 0 hit points, it  
dies but will definitely be reborn, even if the PCs attempt to use an  
icon die result to prevent the resurrection. A PC who scores a critical  
hit against the rakshasa can attempt to nullify *lockheart* by choosing  
to ignore all other effects of the critical hit (all damage, not just  
the doubling) and attempting a normal save. If the save succeeds,  
*lockheart* is ignored this battle. If the save fails, *lockheart* is  
still in effect. A rakshasa can only use *lockheart* once in its  
lifetime.

Alternatively, instead of rolling saves, the PCs could go on a quest to  
find the lockheart’s key before confronting the rakshasa! That’s a story  
angle you get to manipulate as you choose.

*Backwards palms:* When staggered, the rakshasa’s hands shapeshift so  
that its palms trade places with the backs of its hands. It not only  
looks extremely weird, it also presents the player characters with an  
odd choice: The next time the escalation die would advance, the PCs have  
to choose whether the escalation die will decrease by 1 (minimum 0) or  
whether this rakshasa gets to use the escalation die until the end of  
the battle. If the PC group is split, the decision goes to the character  
with the highest initiative.
