## Chaos Hydra

This hydra starts with four heads, but they’re not always the same  
heads! Roll a d6 four times before the fight begins to find out which  
heads the chaos hydra starts the battle with. A head that starts the  
fight may not finish the battle, heads shift mid-fight, and as usual for  
hydras, new heads sprout when the creature takes serious damage.

*One attack per head:* As for the more generic hydras, each of the chaos  
hydra’s heads can make an attack when it uses a standard action. Unlike  
those other hydras, each separate head is going to have its own attack  
style, though it’s possible that the hydra will randomly have two or  
more of the same type of head for a couple rounds!

*Heads with bonuses:* A few of the heads provide abilities or bonuses as  
well as one or two possible attacks. For a change, these bonuses are  
cumulative. For example, a chaos hydra with two draconic heads would  
have a +4 bonus to its AC. Since the heads shift frequently, those  
bonuses won’t last forever.

<p><u>1-2: Reptile head</u>—no bonus</p>
<p><strong>Cutting teeth +13 vs. AC</strong>—46 damage</p>
<p><em>Natural odd miss:</em> After the attack, this head may shift into
a new head; roll 1d6 to determine the new (or maybe repeated!) head.</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> 15 damage.</p>
<p><u>3: Serpent head</u>—hydra gains +2 PD</p>
<p><strong>Serpent teeth +13 vs. AC</strong>—30 damage, and 10 ongoing

a new head; roll 1d6 to determine the new (or maybe repeated!) head.</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> 10 damage.</p>
<p><u>3: Great monstrous head</u>—Hydra gains fear aura, dazing engaged
enemies with fewer than 48 hit points and preventing them from using the
escalation die (for each additional great monstrous head, add +20 points
to the threshold)</p>
<p><strong>Monstrous teeth +11 vs. AC</strong>—60 damage</p>
<p><em>Natural odd miss:</em> After the attack, this head may shift into
a new head; roll 1d6 to determine the new (or maybe repeated!) head.</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> 20 damage.</p>
<p><u>5: Draconic head</u>—hydra gains +2 AC and adds the escalation die
to its attack rolls for either its draconic teeth attack or its minor
breath weapon attack</p>
<p><strong>Draconic teeth +13 vs. AC</strong>—30 damage</p>
<p><em>Natural odd miss:</em> After the attack, this head may shift into
a new head; roll 1d6 to determine the new (or maybe repeated!) head.</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p><strong>C: Minor breath weapon +13 vs. PD (1 nearby
enemy)</strong>—40 random energy damage (roll 1d4; 1: acid, 2: cold; 3:
fire; 4: lightning)</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit:</em> Make a second minor breath weapon attack
against a random different nearby enemy. This second attack lacks this
<em>natural even hit</em> trigger.</p>
<p><em>Natural odd miss:</em> After the attack, this head may shift into
a new head; roll 1d6 to determine the new (or maybe repeated!) head.</p>
<p><u>6: Chaos ray head</u>—hydra can either bite with <em>chaotic
teeth</em> or use <em>chaos ray</em> attack</p>
<p><strong>Chaotic teeth +13 vs. AC</strong>—35 damage</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit:</em> Target is weakened (save ends).</p>
<p><em>Natural odd miss:</em> After the attack, this head may shift into
a new head; roll 1d6 to determine the new (or maybe repeated!) head.</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p><strong>R: Chaotic ray +13 vs. PD (1 nearby or faraway
enemy)</strong>—50 random energy damage (roll 1d4; 1: acid, 2: cold; 3:
fire; 4: lightning)</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit:</em> Roll 1d4; 1: Later this turn, hydra can
teleport somewhere nearby as a quick action, 2: Hydra gains flight until
the end of its next turn, 3: The next attack which hits the hydra must
be rerolled with a -2 attack penalty, 4: GM: roll on the High Weirdness
Table and apply the result in the most amusing way possible.</p>
<p><em>Natural odd miss:</em> After the attack, this head may shift into
a new head; roll 1d6 to determine the new (or maybe repeated!) head.</p>
<p><em>Reaching necks:</em> On its turn, the chaos hydra can use any of
its teeth attacks against nearby creatures it can see and get to, but
has a -2 attack penalty when using teeth attacks against creatures it
not engaged with.</p>
<p><em>Wild thrasher:</em> The chaos hydra’s attacks deal full damage
against creatures it has not already hit this turn. If the chaos hydra
attacks a creature it has hit earlier in the turn, the attack only deals
half damage, hit or miss or crit.</p>
<p><em>Too tough to trick:</em> Whenever the chaos hydra would suffer
any of the following conditions, it ignores the condition and takes 10
damage instead: confused, dazed, hampered, stunned, or weakened.</p>
<p><em>Sprout fifth head:</em> The first time the hydra is staggered, as
a free action it gains 70 hit points and a random fifth head. Roll 1d6
to determine which head. The chaos hydra is considered undamaged at its
new hit point total. Using the hydra’s current hit points as a new
baseline, the hydra will be staggered again when it drops below 50% of
that total.</p>
<p><em>Sprout sixth head:</em> The second time the hydra is staggered,
as a free action it gains 70 hit points and a random sixth head, etc.
Use a new hit point baseline as before, but there is no seventh head
waiting to sprout.</p></td>
