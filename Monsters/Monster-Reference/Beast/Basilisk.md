<p><strong>Multi-legged attack +8 vs. AC (3 attacks, each against a
different enemy)</strong>—12 damage</p>
<p><em>Natural 16+:</em> The target takes 5 ongoing poison damage.</p>
<p><em>Basilisk’s stare:</em> When a basilisk hits an enemy that is
already taking ongoing poison damage, the basilisk can make a
<em>basilisk’s stare</em> attack against the target as a free
action.</p>
<p><em>[Special trigger]</em> <strong>C: Basilisk’s stare +8 vs.
MD</strong>—5 ongoing poison damage, and the target must start making
last gasp saves depending on the basilisk’s type (see below) as it
accidentally takes a full look at the basilisk. Constructs and undead
are immune to this effect.</p>
<p><u>Last Gasp Failed Save Effects</u></p>
<p><strong>Green Basilisk</strong></p>
<p><em>Failed save:</em> The target takes 25 poison damage as its blood
turns to poison.</p>
<p><em>Fourth failed save:</em> The target’s body liquefies and they
die.</p>
<p><strong>Red Basilisk</strong></p>
<p><em>Failed save:</em> The target takes 15 fire damage, and each of
the target’s nearby allies takes 5 fire damage as the target’s blood
boils under their skin and sprays outward in gouts of liquid fire.</p>
<p><em>Fourth failed save:</em> The target’s body ignites as their
flaming skull shoots upward on a jet of burning blood, killing them.</p>
<p><strong>Black Basilisk</strong></p>
<p><em>Failed save:</em> The target’s blood begins to coagulate and
harden, and dust puffs out of their lungs through their mouth.</p>
<p><em>Fourth failed save:</em> The target’s body turns to stone and
they die.</p>
<p><strong>White Basilisk</strong></p>
<p><em>Failed save:</em> The target begins to evaporate. The target must
make an immediate normal save (11+) or it loses a chunk of flesh or a
limb, whatever is dramatic but will allow the creature to survive
(perhaps with minuses until healed).</p>
<p><em>Fourth failed save:</em> The target’s body explodes into a fine
red mist and they die.</p>
<p><em>Resist melee damage 18+:</em> When a melee attack targets this
creature, the attacker must roll a natural 18+ on the attack roll or it
only deals half damage. An attacker can ignore this resistance by
declaring they are looking directly at the basilisk during the attack.
If they do, the basilisk can make a <em>basilisk’s stare</em> attack
against them as a free action before the attack. Constructs and undead
are not affected by this resistance.</p>
<p><em>Stare-down:</em> When an enemy makes a ranged attack against the
basilisk, the basilisk can make a <em>basilisk’s stare</em> attack
against them as a free action before the attack.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p><em>Death breath:</em> Each creature engaged with the basilisk at the
end of the basilisk’s turn takes 10 poison damage.</p></td>
