<td><p>Initiative: +14</p>
<p>Vulnerability: varies (see <em>if it bleeds</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Barrier breaker (1 target, or adjusted targets equal to the
escalation die; see <em>melee breaker</em> ability below) +16 vs.
AC</strong>—125 damage</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit or miss:</em> One normal structure of house or
ship size that the barrier beast is next to is destroyed.</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit:</em> 20 extra damage and the target stuck and
weakened until the start of the barrier beast’s next turn, until the
beast moves, or until it uses <em>beast surge</em>.</p>
<p><em>Natural 16+:</em> A non-druidic spell cast on the barrier beast
ends. If there are none, a non-druidic spell cast on the target
ends.</p>
<p><em>Natural 20:</em> All non-druidic spells cast on the barrier beast
or the target end.</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> 50 damage</p>
<p><em>Melee breaker:</em> The barrier beast’s <em>barrier breaker</em>
attack can target 1 engaged enemy, or engaged enemies equal to the
escalation die; or the attack can target a nearby enemy for a ‘cost’ of
two points on the escalation die. For example, if the escalation die is
6, the attack could target two engaged enemies and two nearby
enemies.</p>
<p><em>Wild Ability:</em> Each barrier beasts has one of the following
wild abilities.</p>
<p><em>Amphibious:</em> The barrier beast can swim underwater swiftly
and indefinitely.</p>
<p><em>Burrowing:</em> As amphibious, but instead of travelling
underwater the barrier beast can “swim” through the earth.</p>
<p><em>Flight:</em> The barrier beast can fly very quickly, if not very
gracefully.</p>
<p><em>Mountain Shell:</em> Twice per battle as a standard action, the
barrier beast can gain a +4 to all defenses until it makes an
attack.</p>
<p><em>Regrowth:</em> Twice per battle as a standard action, the barrier
beast can regain 100 hit points.</p>
<p><em>Beast surge:</em> Once per round when a barrier beast takes more
than 100 damage from an attack, all enemy-caused conditions affecting
the barrier beast end. Then the barrier beast rolls a normal save; if
the save succeeds, the barrier beast gets an additional free action that
depends on its <em>wild ability</em> (see below):</p>
<p>If the barrier beast has <em>amphibious, burrowing, or flight</em>,
it can choose to swim/burrow/ or fly someplace faraway without taking
opportunity attacks as a free action. At the start of its next turn, the
barrier beast gains a free move action.</p>
<p>If the barrier beasts has <em>mountain shell</em>, it uses it as a
free action that does not count against its uses of the ability.</p>
<p>If the barrier beast has <em>regrowth</em>, it can use that ability
as a free action as a free action that does not count against its uses
of the ability.</p>
<p><em>Beast resilience:</em> At-will and basic attacks do not deal miss
damage to a barrier beast, and when an attack against AC or PD targets
this creature it deals half damage unless the natural attack roll is
16+.</p>
<p>This ability does not work against attacks it is vulnerable to, and
ends when the escalation die is 6+.</p>
<p><em>Shrug:</em> The barrier beast ignores damage that’s less than
10.</p>
<p><em>If it bleeds:</em> Each barrier beast is vulnerable to one damage
type (chosen by the GM or determined randomly). When a barrier beast is
hit by an attack it is vulnerable to, it cannot use <em>beast surge</em>
until the end of its next turn.</p>
<p><em>Big enough:</em> A barrier beast is immune to opportunity attacks
from any creature that is not huge size or larger (like a barrier
beast). Normal sized enemies can disengage from a barrier beast by
rolling 6+ instead of the normal 11+.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p><em>Wilder beast:</em> The barrier beast has two (or even three!)
<em>wild abilities</em> instead of one. Choose which additional effect
is used each time beast surge is triggered.</p>
<p><em>Breath weapon:</em> When the escalation die is even the barrier
beast can make a <em>breath weapon</em> attack as a quick action once
per round, or use it as the additional effect when <em>beast surge</em>
is triggered. Pick or roll a random energy type that is different from
the vulnerability of the barrier beast. <em>Breath weapon</em> does that
type of damage</p>
<p><strong>C: Breath weapon +16 vs. PD (1d4 nearby or faraway enemies in
a group)</strong>—40 damage</p>
<p><em>Natural 16+:</em> 20 ongoing damage</p>
