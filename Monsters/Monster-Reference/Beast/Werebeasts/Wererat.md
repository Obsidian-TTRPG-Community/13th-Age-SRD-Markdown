<p><strong>Infected bite +7 vs. AC</strong>—2 damage and 2 ongoing
damage, and the crit range for each wererat in the battle against the
target expands by 1 (cumulative)</p>
<p><em>Natural 11+:</em> The target can’t make opportunity attacks until
the end of the turn (making it easier for the wererat to move away from
the target).</p>
<p><em>Hybrid miss:</em> While in hybrid form, when the wererat makes an
opportunity attack with <em>infected bite</em>, it deals damage equal to
its level on a miss.</p>
<p><em>Unnatural vigor (hybrid or animal form only):</em> When the
wererat is not staggered at the start of its turn, it heals 5 hp.</p>
<p><em>Bestial fury (hybrid form only):</em> Wererats gain a bonus to
damage equal to the escalation die (champion: double the die; epic:
quadruple the die).</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p><em>Uncanny moves:</em> The wererat takes no damage and suffers no
effects from attacks that miss.</p>
<p><em>Piercing shriek:</em> Once per battle when the escalation die is
2+ and there are three or more wererats in the battle, a wererat can
make a <em>piercing shriek</em> attack as a free action. Usually all the
wererats in the battle will do this at the same time.</p>

enemy)</strong>—4 damage</p>
