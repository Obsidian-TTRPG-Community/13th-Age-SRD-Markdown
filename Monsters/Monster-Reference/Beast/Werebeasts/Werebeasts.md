### Werebeasts

Each werebeast can take one of three forms as a quick action once per
round: a humanoid form, a beast form, or a hybrid form that combines the
two. The hybrid form is the most powerful in combat, but the humanoid
and beast forms are useful for various activities outside of combat as
well.

The stats below work for the beast and hybrid forms. If a werebeast ends
up fighting in humanoid form, subtract 2 from all its defenses and halve
its normal attack damage.

The following powers are common for werebeasts.

*Beast heart (all three forms):* Animals of the werebeast’s type are
intuitively on good terms with the were, even dire animals. If the
werebeast betrays them, however, retaliation is certain and merciless.

*Cursed bite (hybrid or animal form only):* While the moon is full, the
first time each battle a creature takes damage from a werebeast melee
attack, it takes 10 extra damage (champion: 20 damage; epic: 40 damage).
The malignant curse, transmitted through the attack, shocks the mortal
flesh. Further attacks, even from weres of different types, don’t cause
extra damage. Unless blessed, purged, or otherwise cured, the damaged
creature will turn into a werebeast on the night of the next full moon.
Heroes powerful enough to fight werebeasts can usually find benefactors
or rituals to cure them, but there’s an exception to every rule. GM, if
you’re unsure whether it’s a full moon, roll a d10. On a 1–3, the moon
is full enough.

*Resilient shifting (all three forms):* As mentioned above, a werebeast
can shift forms once per round as a quick action. When a werebeast
shifts, it can roll a save against one save ends effect.

<u>Nastier Specials for all werebeasts</u>

The following ability is extremely nasty when combined with the *bestial
fury* most werebeasts have. It’s possibly better used as a story option,
a consequence of a problem with a skill check or an icon relationship,
or a situation that should have been avoided and may require sacrifices
to deal with:

*Moon fury (hybrid form only):* While fighting in moonlight, a werebeast
gains a bonus to damage equal to its level (champion: double its level;
epic: triple it).
