<p><strong>Gnashing teeth +10 vs. AC (5 attacks)</strong>—10 damage</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit or miss:</em> The hydra’s next <em>gnashing
teeth</em> attack, if it has an attack left this turn, can be against
any nearby enemy instead of against a creature engaged with it.</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> 5 damage.</p>
<p><em>Too tough to trick:</em> Whenever the hydra would suffer any of
the following conditions, it ignores the condition and takes 5 damage
instead: confused, dazed, hampered, stunned, or weakened.</p>
<p><em>Roiling swirl:</em> If the hydra has at least two <em>gnashing
teeth</em> attacks left during a turn, it can expend one of those
attacks to move to engage a nearby enemy as a free action (but it will
take opportunity attacks for doing so).</p>
<p><em>Sprout sixth head:</em> The first time the hydra is staggered, as
a free action it gains 40 hit points and a sixth <em>gnashing teeth</em>
attack, and is considered undamaged at its new hit point total. Using
the hydra’s current hit points as a new baseline, the hydra will be
staggered again when it drops below 50% of that total.</p>
<p><em>Sprout seventh head:</em> The second time the hydra is staggered,
as a free action it gains 40 hit points and a seventh <em>gnashing
teeth</em> attack, etc. Use a new hit point baseline as before, but
there is no eighth head waiting to sprout.</p>
