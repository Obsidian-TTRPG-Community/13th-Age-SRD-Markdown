<p>Initiative: +17</p>
<p><strong>Wrathful Earth + 19 vs. AC (3 attacks)</strong>—60 damage</p>
<p><em>Natural 16+:</em> The target is stuck and takes 60 ongoing damage
(hard save ends both). Until the target saves it remains engaged with
the Fallen Icon, though it cannot be otherwise targeted or damaged by
the Fallen Icon (which does nothing to prevent the Fallen Icon’s allies
from piling on!). If the target attacks and hits the Fallen Icon for
more than 100 damage, their next save against the <em>wrathful
earth</em> effect is an easy one (6+).</p>
<p><strong>C: Angry Sky + 19 vs. PD (all nearby flying enemies, and a
number of random nearby enemies equal to the escalation die, one attack
per target, or all nearby enemies when the escalation die is 6 or
higher)</strong>—50 lightning damage and target loses the flight ability
(save ends)</p>
<p><em>Natural even miss:</em> 30 thunder damage.</p>
<p><em>Natural odd miss:</em> 15 cold damage.</p>
<p><em>Special trigger:</em> Use as a free action once per turn at the
start of the Fallen Icon’s turn.</p>
<p><em>Ambulatory landscape:</em> When the Fallen Icon uses its first
move action each turn, each creature of less than huge size that is
engaged with or next to it before or after the movement takes 60 damage.
In addition, the Fallen Icon is immune to opportunity attacks. Enemies
of less than huge size can disengage from it with an easy save (6+).</p>
<p><em>Wildest shape:</em> At the start of its turn, the Fallen Icon can
change its creature type to beast, elemental, or plant. This ends all
conditions affecting it.</p>
<p><em>Natural resistance:</em> The Fallen Icon has <em>resist poison
16+</em>. In addition, as a beast it has <em>resist cold 16+</em>. As a
plant it has <em>resist lightning 16+</em>. As an elemental it has
<em>resist fire 16+</em>.</p>
<p><em>Earth and sea and sky:</em> The Fallen Icon can sprout wings to
clumsily fly, and can swim indefinitely at any depth.</p>
<p><em>Natural supremacy:</em> The Fallen Icon’s existence disrupts
arcane magic and divine magic (but not druidic magic): natural odd hits
by arcane and divine spells miss the Fallen Icon, while odd misses are
rerolled against an enemy engaged with the Fallen Icon. Natural 1s
target the caster.</p>
<p><em>Enemy of civilization:</em> As a move action, the Fallen Icon can
destroy one ordinary structure it can reach, such as a house, castle
wall, temple, or ship. The structure is automatically rendered useless,
and each creature inside or on the structure is subject to a
<em>collapse</em> attack</p>
<p><strong>Collapse +16 vs. PD (each creature in/on
structure)</strong>—90 damage and the target is stuck and takes 20
ongoing damage (hard save ends both, 16+)</p>
<p><em>Those that walk the forest:</em> Whenever the Fallen Icon becomes
staggered, suffers more than 120 damage from a single attack, or is
critically hit, a mob of Fallen Icon mooks will join the battle nearby
the triggering enemy. While these creatures are in play, the Fallen Icon
has a bonus to all defenses equal to the number of Fallen Icon mobs in
the battle.</p>
<p><em>Seeds on the wind:</em> If the Fallen Icon is slain, the GM
secretly rolls a normal save (11+) at the end of <em>each session</em>,
including this one. If the save succeeds, the Fallen Icon returns to
life near where it fell or in some distant wilderness. If the campaign
somehow ends while the Fallen Icon is still dead, it’s the GM’s call
whether the Fallen Icon stays dead or rises after the events of the
campaign.</p>
<p><u>Nastier special</u></p>
<p><em>Omnivorous:</em> When a creature engaged with or next to the
Fallen Icon dies (including the last mook of a mob), the Fallen Icon
consumes it and regains 100 HP.</p></td>

First PC campaign victory: Remove the Fallen Icon’s *natural supremacy*  
ability.

Second PC campaign victory: *Angry sky* only triggers when the  
escalation die is even.

Third PC campaign victory: Remove the *seeds on the wind* ability.

Fourth PC campaign victory: Remove the 60 damage dealt by the  
*ambulatory landscape* ability.

<u>Mook Squads</u>

When *those that walk the forest* is triggered, roll 1d4+2 for the  
number of mooks in the mob. Then roll a d6 to determine which mooks join  
the battle; 1–2: fanatical druid circle; 3: frenzied wolf pack; 4:  
militant ranger squad; 5: opportunistic orc band; 6: treant avenger.

Remember that starting a battle with these mooks in play makes the  
Fallen Icon tougher thanks to the defense bonus that’s part of *those  
that walk the forest*.
