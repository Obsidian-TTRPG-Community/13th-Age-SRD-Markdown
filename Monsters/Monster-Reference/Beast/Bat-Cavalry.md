<p><strong>Fangs, wings, and sword +8 vs. AC</strong>—Damage and effect
depends on the natural roll</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit:</em> The target takes 10 damage from a sword
strike, and the bat cavalry pops free from the target and can move as a
free action.</p>
<p><em>Natural even miss against a target taking ongoing damage:</em>
The target takes 6 damage from clawing wings.</p>
<p><em>Natural odd hit:</em> The target takes 8 damage, and 5 ongoing
damage from bat fangs.</p>
<p><em>Natural 2–5:</em> In addition to any other effect, the bat
cavalry pops free from the target, and as a free action, it can move to
another nearby enemy and make a <em>fangs, wings, and sword</em> attack
against it.</p>
<p><strong>R: Thrown javelin +5 vs. AC</strong>—8 damage</p>
<p><em>Resist ranged damage 16+:</em> When a ranged attack targets this
creature while it’s flying, the attacker must roll a natural 16+ on the
attack roll or it only deals half damage.</p>
<p><em>Skittish:</em> A bat cavalry engaged with a conscious enemy after
attacking it will attempt to disengage and fly into the air if it has a
move action remaining that turn.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p><em>Blood drinker:</em> When the bat cavalry drops an enemy to 0 hp
or below, it continues to attack that enemy (until it dies) instead of
attacking other enemies.</p></td>
