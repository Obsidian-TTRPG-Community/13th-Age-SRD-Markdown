<p><u>Creature of Legend</u></p>
<p>The tarrasque can make one close attack and one melee attack each
round as a standard action. Note that flying is usually no defense
against the tarrasque, which is huge and powerful enough to pluck or
whack enemies out of the sky with surprising leaps.</p>
<p><strong>All-enveloping toothy maw +19 vs. AC</strong>—155 damage</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit:</em> The tarrasque grabs the target. It will
swallow a grabbed enemy in 1d3 rounds (see <em>swallow whole</em>).</p>
<p><em>Natural 16+:</em> The tarrasque swallows the target immediately
(see <em>swallow whole</em>).</p>
<p><strong>Immense spike, horn, or tusk +18 vs. AC</strong>—155
damage</p>
<p><em>Natural 16+:</em> The target takes 9d6 extra damage and pops free
from the tarrasque as it’s hurled faraway.</p>
<p><strong>C: Earth-shaking, taloned claw +20 vs. AC (each nearby enemy
in a group)</strong>—155 damage</p>
<p><em>Natural 16+:</em> The target is stunned (save ends).</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> The target is dazed (save ends).</p>
<p><strong>C: Cataclysmic tail slam +18 vs. PD (each nearby enemy in a
group)</strong>—170 damage</p>
<p><em>Natural 16+:</em> The target is vulnerable (save ends).</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> The target is dazed until the end of its next
turn.</p>
<p><em>Amphibious:</em> The tarrasque can swim and breathe underwater
(or it holds so much air in its vast lungs that it makes no
difference).</p>
<p><em>Enormously bulky:</em> The tarrasque is so huge that it ignores
opportunity attacks. In addition, normal-sized enemies are like fleas to
it, and disengaging from the tarrasque requires only an easy save (6+),
unless the target is grabbed.</p>
<p><em>Immortal:</em> The tarrasque can’t be killed, save by the
explicit will of a god (and not some jumped-up local god, either) or,
perhaps, the sacrifice of a great icon. The tarrasque’s HP total
indicates the amount of damage required to make it disgorge swallowed
enemies and flee to go hibernate while it regenerates the damage it
suffered and decide if it wants to rampage again.</p>
<p><em>Inflexible:</em> The tarrasque can’t easily fight foes that get
onto its back, and may not even notice them if they aren’t attacking it.
When it does tire of a passenger, it can either use its <em>tail
slam</em> attack (–2 attack penalty: on a hit, the target only takes
half damage and is knocked off the tarrasque [possibly falling damage];
on a miss, the target takes no damage) or a <em>drag</em> attack as a
standard action, crushing the rider between its shell and a mountainside
or other high, hard obstacle.</p>
<p><strong>Drag +21 vs. PD (each creature on its back)</strong>—130
damage, the target pops free of the tarrasque, and the target is
hampered (save ends)</p>
<p><em>Legendary resistance:</em> The tarrasque is immune to normal
conditions and effects (stunned, weakened, etc.), but it isn’t
completely impervious. Bypassing its resistances requires icon-supported
effort. A PC can use one 5 or 6 they acquired from icon relationship
dice rolls to overcome the resistance each time they use an attack or
power that would apply a condition or effect upon the tarrasque. Of
course, they must also provide a story to go along with the reason the
tarrasque is affected.</p>
<p><em>Leveler:</em> When the escalation die is even, as a move action
the tarrasque can demolish any ordinary structure it can reach, such as
a house, castle wall, temple, or ship. The beast automatically reduces
the structure to rubble, rendering it useless. Each creature on top of
or within the structure is subject to a <em>collapse</em> attack.</p>
<p><strong>Collapse +18 vs. PD (each creature in/on the
structure)</strong>—90 damage, and the target is stuck and takes 20
ongoing damage (hard save ends both, 16+)</p>
<p><em>Swallow whole:</em> Once a creature is swallowed, it goes inside
one of the tarrasque’s gigantic stomachs. It can still act while inside
the tarrasque, but it will have to deal with the beast’s stomach acid
that is splashing around. A swallowed creature must deal 400 damage to
the tarrasque to force it to disgorge the contents of its gullet,
freeing the creature. During the tarrasque’s turn, it can make a
<em>gullet digestion</em> attack against the target as a free
action.</p>
<p><strong>Gullet digestion +19 vs. PD</strong>—80 acid damage, and 20
ongoing acid damage</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> 5d12 acid damage.</p>
<p><em>Soft-ish innerbelly:</em> The tarrasque doesn’t have scales on
the inside. It takes a –5 penalty to all defenses against attacks from
inside its gullet, though only melee and close attacks can be made in
there. The tarrasque’s insides are immune to acid damage, however.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p><em>Fear:</em> While engaged with the tarrasque, enemies that have
216 hp or fewer are dazed (–4 attack) and do not add the escalation die
to their attacks.</p>
<p><em>Regeneration 230:</em> While a tarrasque is damaged, its malign
magical flesh heals 230 hit points at the start of the tarrasque’s turn.
It can regenerate five times per battle. If it heals up to its maximum
hit points, then that use of <em>regeneration</em> doesn’t count against
the five-use limit. With this power, the monstrosity is likely
unstoppable without a powerful magical artifact designed specifically to
bind, wound, or otherwise hamper the tarrasque.</p></td>
