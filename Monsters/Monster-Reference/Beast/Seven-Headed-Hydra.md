<p><strong>Gnashing teeth +12 vs. AC (7 attacks)</strong>—12 damage</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit or miss:</em> The hydra’s next <em>gnashing
teeth</em> attack, if it has an attack left this turn, can be against
any nearby enemy instead of against a creature engaged with it.</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> 7 damage.</p>
<p><em>Let’s not waste space:</em> The seven-headed hydra has all the
same abilities as the five-headed hydra, except that the heads that get
sprouted are the 8<sup>th</sup> and 9<sup>th</sup> and those
heads/attacks come with 50 new hit points apiece.</p>
<p>And it has one additional ability…</p>
<p><em>Resist opportunity attacks 16+:</em> When an opportunity attack
targets this creature, the attacker must roll a natural 16+ on the
attack roll or it only deals half damage.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p><em>Pyrohydra:</em> When the hydra gets a natural even attack roll
with a <em>gnashing teeth</em> attack, its next attack that turn (if it
has one) is a <em>flame breath</em> attack instead. Note that <em>flame
breath</em> attacks don’t lead to other flaming breaths; the hydra has
to return to making a <em>gnashing teeth</em> attack first.</p>
<p><strong>C: Flame breath +12 vs. PD (1d2 nearby enemies)</strong>—2d12
fire damage</p>
