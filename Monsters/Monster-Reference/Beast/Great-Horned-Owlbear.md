the owlbear</p>
<p><em>Savage hybrid:</em> If the escalation die is odd, make another
<em>rip and peck</em> attack.</p>
<p><em>Feed the cubs:</em> An owlbear that scores a critical hit against
a hampered enemy tears a piece of the creature off (GM chooses a limb)
and will subsequently attempt to retreat with the prize, screeching to
its cubs to flee with it. The torn-up enemy is stunned until the end of
its next turn.</p>
<p><em>Silent hunter:</em> Checks to hear a great horned owlbear take a
-5 penalty.</p>
<p><em>Half owl, half bear, half marvel:</em> Until the escalation die
is 5+, if no enemies are hampered at the start of the great horned
owlbear’s turn, it regenerates 3d6 hit points.</p></td>
