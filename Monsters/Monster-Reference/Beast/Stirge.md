<p><strong>Claws +7 vs. AC</strong>—2 damage, and the stirge can make a
<em>draining probe</em> attack against the target during its next turn
if it’s still engaged with the target</p>
<p><em>[Special trigger]</em> <strong>Draining probe +7 vs. AC (one
enemy hit by <em>claws</em> last turn)</strong>—5 damage, and 5 ongoing
damage</p>
<p><em>Flight:</em> Stirges fly well. Also, the pitch of their wings is
high and thin, allowing a stirge to get very close without tipping off
its prey.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p><em>One and done:</em> After hitting a living creature that has blood
with its <em>draining probe</em> attack, the stirge heals 5 hit points
and will use its next turn to move, fleeing to the hive to feed the
stirgelings…and to alert the hive that there is an easy meal nearby. A
new full-strength stirge enters the battle during the next round on the
same initiative count.</p></td>
