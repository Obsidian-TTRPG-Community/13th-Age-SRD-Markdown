## Beast or Animal Critter

For dire animal abilities, see [Dire Animals](../../Monster-Rules/Dire-Animals.md).

All bats have the following abilities:

-   *Echolocation:* Bats rely on sound waves to sense their surroundings. A bat can “see” in total darkness, and can detect creatures using invisibility or visual illusions to hide.
-   *Flight:* Small bats fly quickly and turn easily. Bigger bats fly more awkwardly.
-   *Wall-crawler:* A bat can climb on ceilings and walls as easily as it moves on the ground.
