<p><strong>Devouring maw +13 vs. PD</strong>—50 damage</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit:</em> The target is swallowed whole if it’s
smaller than the worm (see below).</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> Half damage.</p>
<p><strong>Tail sting +13 vs. AC (one random nearby enemy)</strong>—20
damage, and 20 ongoing poison damage</p>
<p><strong>C: Mighty thrash +13 vs. AC (1d3 random nearby
enemies)</strong>—30 damage</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> Half damage.</p>
<p><em>Natural 1–5:</em> The worm takes 10 damage (but it still deals
miss damage on a 2–5).</p>
<p><em>Limited use:</em> The worm can make this attack as a free action
if it has no enemies swallowed after using its standard action during
its turn.</p>
<p><em>Swallow whole:</em> While a creature is swallowed whole, it takes
7d10 acid damage at the start of its turn and is stuck, hampered, and
unable to attack or affect anything outside the worm’s stomach (and
vice-versa). Most teleport abilities don’t work because you’re hampered
<em>and</em> you can’t see the location out of the worm you want to
teleport to. There are two ways out.</p>
<p><strong>Cut your way out:</strong> Deal 40 damage to the worm with a
single attack and you can cut your way out. All edged or bladed weapons
are reduced to d6 damage dice (at most) inside the worm’s gullet, so
good luck. At least you’ll be damaging the worm attacking it from
within.</p>
<p><strong>Get upchucked:</strong> While the worm is staggered, you can
use a standard action to try and crawl out of its mouth. Roll a hard
save (16+); on a success, the worm vomits you out and spits you
somewhere nearby. The worm also vomits out all creatures it has
swallowed when it drops to 0 hp.</p>
<p><em>Burrow:</em> As the standard monster ability.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p><em>Larval feeding:</em> The worm’s stomach also includes a mob of
larval mooks (purple larvae or parasitic lightning beetles). Feel free
to add this nastier special if a PC acts dismissive about the
possibility of being swallowed by the worm.</p>
<p><em>Resist most energy damage 16+:</em> Purple worms generate weird
energy resistances thanks to underworld radiation and their odd diets.
Roll a d8 twice, in secret, to determine what energy types the worm is
not resistant to. The PCs probably have to find out what energy works
best against the worm the hard way, though you might have mercy and
allow a DC 35 Wisdom skill check to figure out what energy types work
against the worm.</p>
