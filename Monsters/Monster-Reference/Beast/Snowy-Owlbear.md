<p><strong>Peck &amp; tear +8 vs. AC (2 attacks)</strong>—8 damage, and
until the end of the owlbear’s next turn, the target is hampered while
engaged with the owlbear</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit:</em> Until the end of the snowy owlbear’s next
turn, the target is hampered while engaged with the owlbear.</p>
<p><em>Feed the cubs:</em> A snowy owlbear that scores a critical hit
against a hampered enemy tears a piece of the creature off (GM chooses a
limb) and will subsequently attempt to retreat with the prize,
screeching to its cubs to flee with it. The torn-up enemy is stunned
until the end of its next turn.</p>
<p><em>Protect the cubs:</em> The snowy owlbear’s crit range expands by
1 for each owlbear cub that has dropped this battle.</p>
<p><em>Resist cold 14+:</em> Attacks that deal cold damage deal half
damage to the snowy owlbear unless they roll a natural 14+.</p>
<p><em>Silent hunter:</em> Checks to hear a snowy owlbear take a -5
penalty.</p></td>
