<p><strong>C: Mellifluous music +13 vs. MD (one nearby
enemy)</strong>—20 psychic damage and the target is entranced and
becomes confused (save ends). Often, instead of attacking their fellows,
the hapless sap rushes to the creature’s side, permitting the nix/nixie
to use their what lies beneath attack on their next turn provided they
are close to a suitable water source</p>
<p><em>Limited use:</em> Can only be used when the escalation die is
even.</p>
<p><em>[Special trigger]</em> <strong>What lies beneath</strong>—Any
creature drawn to the nix/nixie’s side and still confused falls into the
creature’s arms and lets themselves be dragged under the water by their
new paramour. They begin to make last gasp saves (in place of those for
being confused), drowning when they reach their fifth failure.</p>
<p><em>Shapechanger:</em> As a standard action, the nix/nixie can change
its form to that of any humanoid, or turn back into their true form. A
successful DC 25 skill check is required to see through the shapechange.
Whether or not the old wives’ tale about nix/nixies always having wet
hems is true in your game is up to you; but if it is, the DC check may
be lowered to 20 as a result.</p></td>

## Nymph

<u>Standard powers for all nymphs</u>

*Domain bound:* Nymphs are tied to an area of land or water. Land areas  
will be at most a couple miles wide; water areas might be much larger.  
As a rule, nymphs can’t leave the area they’re bound to.

*Limited immortality:* A nymph that drops to 0 hit points or is  
otherwise slain will eventually return to life in its domain, so long as  
its domain and its secret survives. After an hour, a nymph needs a hard  
save to return to life. After eight hours, a nymph needs a normal save  
to return to life. If the nymph has still not returned, roll an easy  
save at the end of each 24 hours until the nymph succeeds.

*Note on types:* The following nymphs with the humanoid type probably  
remember themselves. Nymphs that have probably forgotten their original  
selves have the elemental type.
