All bats have the following abilities:

-   Echolocation: Bats rely on sound waves to sense their surroundings. A bat can “see” in total darkness, and can detect creatures using invisibility or visual illusions to hide.
-   Flight: Small bats fly quickly and turn easily. Bigger bats fly more awkwardly.
-   Wall-crawler: A bat can climb on ceilings and walls as easily as it moves on the ground.
