<p><strong>Claws and fangs +12 vs. AC (2 attacks)</strong>—15 damage</p>
<p><strong>Blazing pounce +12 vs. AC</strong>—13 damage, and the hellcat
pops free from the target and uses its move action to engage a nearby
enemy. It can’t be intercepted during this movement. It then makes a
second attack that also deals 10 ongoing fire damage on a hit.</p>
<p><em>Limited use:</em> The hellcat must have its move action available
to use <em>blazing pounce</em>.</p>
<p><strong>C: Fiery breath +10 vs. PD (1d3 nearby enemies)</strong>—15
fire damage</p>
<p><em>Devil’s due (stalker):</em> When you choose to add the escalation
die to an attack against a hellcat, during its next turn it gains a
cumulative +2 bonus to attack if it’s invisible. Otherwise, it gains a
non-cumulative +2 bonus to all defenses until the start of its next turn
as its form blurs.</p>
<p><em>Fire fur:</em> When an enemy is engaged with the hellcat at the
start of its turn, that enemy takes 5 fire damage.</p>
<p><em>Invisible:</em> While in bright light, the hellcat is invisible;
attacks against it have a 50% miss chance.</p>
<p><em>Resist fire 13+:</em> When a fire attack targets this creature,
the attacker must roll a natural 13+ on the attack roll or it only deals
half damage.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p><em>Corona aura:</em> Fire attacks that target an enemy engaged with
the hellcat gain:</p>
<p><em>Natural 16+:</em> The target takes 5 extra fire damage.</p>
<p><em>Fearless pursuer:</em> A hellcat takes only half damage from
opportunity attacks.</p></td>
