<p><strong>Hidden dagger +9 vs. AC</strong>—6 damage</p>
<p><em>The target has MD 15 or lower:</em> The honey devil can make a
disengage check this turn as a free action.</p>
<p><em>Desperate plea:</em> When the honey devil is staggered by an
attack, it makes a <em>confusing plea</em> attack against the attacker
as a free action after the attack.</p>
<p><strong>Confusing plea +9 vs. MD</strong>—The target is confused
(save ends)</p>
<p><em>Glamour of innocence:</em> This creature seems innocent, not
someone a hero should hurt. At worst, it’s ugly, but is that a crime?
When an enemy rolls a natural odd attack roll against a honey devil, the
attack misses and has no effect.</p>
<p><em>Resist fire 13+:</em> When a fire attack targets this creature,
the attacker must roll a natural 13+ on the attack roll or it only deals
half damage.</p>
<p><em>Weakling:</em> When building battles using this monster, it only
counts as half a normal monster.</p>
<p><em>Free-form covert ability—Slimy:</em> In any non-combat struggles
with a honey devil, it excels at being too slippery for the PCs, both
personally and through its underground network of minions. In an
indirect contest, the PCs might try to talk sense to one of the devil’s
dupes or to discern suspicious activity while staking out the devil’s
secret network. The honey devil is an expert at what it does, so use DC
25 for any such skill checks. Assume that the devil is competent at
slipping its influence through the network unnoticed. Failure might mean
that the PC has succeeded in gaining information, which in turn sends
them down a dead end or into a trap. In a direct confrontation, the
devil is likewise hard to pin down, see through, or otherwise get the
better of.</p>
<p>A slime devil seems unremarkable and innocuous, so downplay its
significance whenever describing it, especially when it has company.
When mortals actually decide to attack or capture a honey devil, it’s
probably slippery enough to escape at the last minute, maybe through a
hidden exit.</p></td>
