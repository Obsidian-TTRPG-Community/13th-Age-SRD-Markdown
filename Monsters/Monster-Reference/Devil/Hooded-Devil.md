<p><em>Natural 16+:</em> If this is the devil’s first attack during its
turn, it can make a <em>telepathic harry</em> attack as a free
action.</p>
<p><strong>C: Telepathic harry +12 vs. MD (one nearby
enemy)</strong>—The target takes 30 psychic damage each time it makes a
non-basic attack (save ends). The target silently hears a terribly
hurtful statement, in the voice of the person who would hurt them the
most by saying it.</p>
<p><em>Natural 16+:</em> If this is the devil’s first attack during its
turn, it can make a <em>crushing punch or kick</em> attack as a free
action.</p>
<p><em>Devil’s due (Mastery):</em> When you choose to add the escalation
die to an attack against a hooded devil, it adds the escalation die to
its attacks until the end of the battle and no other attacks against it
can use the escalation die.</p>
<p><em>Resist fire 13+:</em> When a fire attack targets this creature,
the attacker must roll a natural 13+ on the attack roll or it only deals
half damage.</p>
<p><em>Restoration:</em> At the start of a hooded devil’s turn, it can
roll a save against each save ends effect affecting it if it doesn’t
attack that turn (so it could successfully save against confused or
stunned conditions and still move that turn, for example.)</p>
<p><em>Free-form covert ability—Master:</em> A hooded devil
instinctively masters everything around it: the furniture, terrain,
conversations, and people. If the PCs attempt to overcome a hooded devil
through skill checks, the check is DC 30. Good luck if you need to win
an argument, get to an exit first, use terrain to your advantage, or
pressure one of the devil’s thugs to rat it out. The name of this
ability is a verb.</p></td>
