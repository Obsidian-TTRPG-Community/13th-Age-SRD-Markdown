<p><em>Natural 16+:</em> The bearded devil gains a +4 bonus to all
defenses until the start of its next turn.</p>

devil misses it with an attack, the devil can make a <em>filthy
beard</em> attack against that enemy as a free action.</p>
<p><em>Devil’s due (Solidity):</em> When you choose to add the
escalation die to an attack against a bearded devil, the devil or one of
its nearby allies can roll a save against a save ends effect.</p>
<p><em>Opportunistic beard:</em> When the bearded devil makes an
opportunity attack, it can also make a <em>filthy beard</em> attack
against the same target as a free action.</p>
<p><em>Skilled interceptor:</em> A bearded devil can intercept an enemy
while engaged with other enemies. As a free action, it can either make a
disengage check to try to move to intercept the enemy, or move to
intercept the enemy and only take half damage from opportunity
attacks.</p>
<p><em>Resist fire 13+:</em> When a fire attack targets this creature,
the attacker must roll a natural 13+ on the attack roll or it only deals
half damage.</p>

beard</em> attack now takes 10 ongoing poison damage and is weakened
