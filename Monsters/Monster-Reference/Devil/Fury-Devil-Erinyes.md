## Fury Devil (Erinyes)

<u>Hellbent</u>

Fury devils become hellbent against a creature for story reasons outside  
the scope of a single battle. PCs could give devils ample reason to hate  
them. Or a succession of 5s as relationship dice with icon interactions  
that involve the devils might suffice to make the fury devil hellbent.  
More often than not, it won’t be one of the PCs who is the target, but  
getting in the way of hellbent furies is a problem. They will try to  
bypass defenders, however, to concentrate on killing their target or  
targets.

Typically, a single fury devil leaves the Pit to exact retribution. If  
heroes manage to beat that erinyes back, then three new fury devils rise  
up to try to finish the mission that the first one failed at, and  
whoever killed the first erinyes is on their hit list, too. If those  
devils fail, five erinyes come next, with another hero added to their  
list. If stout-hearted heroes defeat all five fury devils, they’re safe.  
Maybe.

<p><em>Resist fire 13+:</em> When a fire attack targets this creature,
the attacker must roll a natural 13+ on the attack roll or it only deals
half damage.</p></td>
