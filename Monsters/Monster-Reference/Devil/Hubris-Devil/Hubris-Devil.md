## Devil, Hubris

<u>Nastier Specials for all hubris devils</u>

*Friend or enemy?:* A hubris devil using NPCs to attack the heroes makes  
it tough for them to know if there are friends or allies among the  
attackers, forcing the characters to be more careful with their attacks.  
Any natural 1–5 attack roll against the devil is an automatic miss with  
no miss damage.

*Surprise!:* When the hubris devil attacks, it gains a surprise round  
unless the PCs were extremely perceptive (by making a ridiculously hard  
skill check for tier).

*Final-gasp soul snatch & escape:* When the devil drops to 0 hp, it  
appears dead until the start of its next turn, at which point it will  
attempt to steal a piece of the soul of the closest character before it  
escapes into a supernatural bolt hole. That character must roll a save.  
If they fail, they lose a chunk of their soul—see below for possible  
effects. Anyone who uses a coup de grace on the devil before its next  
turn will slay it before it can claim a chunk of a soul and escape (but  
the PCs might not be aware of this).

**Effects:** What does it mean to have a chunk of your soul stolen.  
You’re free to come up with complications that suit your campaign’s  
metaphysics or take the suggestions that follow as a starting point. Use  
one or more, as you choose.

- Magic items no longer work for the affected character, even ones  
  already attuned to them, and in a similar vein, no new items can be  
  attuned by that PC.

- The PC loses access to their highest level of spells or powers. For  
  example, a cleric who normally casts 7<sup>th</sup> level spells could  
  only cast them at 5<sup>th</sup> level.

- The PC takes a –2 penalty to saves.

- The PC must roll 2d20 for attack rolls and take the lowest result for  
  the first two rounds of each battle.

- The PC’s appearance changes in some disturbing, hollow way and they  
  take a –4 penalty to skill checks.

- PC loses one to three recoveries; not temporarily, their ability to  
  heal decreases.

- One icon relationship changes to become a sign of complications with  
  devils, not advantages.

- Devils gets some huge combat advantage against the PC.

**Restoration:** Similarly, you can choose how the missing piece of soul  
might be restored. Some examples:

- No big deal: the PC rolls a normal save each time they gain a level.  
  If the save succeeds, they get their soul back.

- The party must find and kill the escaped hubris devil. Luckily, the  
  PC’s ‘link’ to the devil means that each day the PC can roll a normal  
  save; on an 11+, they have a good idea of which direction the devil is  
  in. And hubris devils don’t move all that much.

- Instead, the party must travel to the center of the devils’ power and  
  steal back their friend’s soul shard. Or whatever it is that you think  
  their particular soul piece is gonna look like.

- The devils immediately barter the soul shard to an enemy icon, leading  
  to an entirely new set of quests and complications.
