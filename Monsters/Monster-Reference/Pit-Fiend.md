<p><strong>Fiendish weapon +19 vs. AC (2 attacks)</strong>—140 damage,
and until the end of the battle the target takes a –2 penalty to
attacks, defenses, and level-based d20 rolls. Hit points, feats, weapon
damage, and other level-based benefits don’t change. (The penalty isn’t
cumulative.)</p>
<p><em>Natural 11+:</em> The pit fiend can make an <em>entangling
tail</em> attack against a different target as a free action.</p>
<p><em>Both attacks hit:</em> The pit fiend can use <em>fiendish
vigor</em> as a free action.</p>
<p><strong>Entangling tail +19 vs. PD</strong>—40 damage, and the target
is hampered until the end of its next turn or until the pit fiend makes
another <em>entangling tail</em> attack.</p>

<p><em>Devil’s due (Menace):</em> When you choose to add the escalation
die to an attack against a pit fiend, the escalation die does not
increase at the start of the next round. Special circumstances and PC
powers can still increase it.</p>
<p><em>Fiendish vigor:</em> As a standard action, the pit fiend can heal
300 hp and roll a save against each ongoing effect on it. It can use
<em>fiendish vigor</em> up to five times per battle.</p>
<p><em>Flight:</em> Amidst wind and flames, a pit fiend can fly with
surprising agility.</p>

the attacker must roll a natural 13+ on the attack roll or it only deals
half damage.</p>

## Devil, Fang

Fang Devil is a singular river creature. The first time the heroes  
encounter the devil, it should be a 7<sup>th</sup> level monster. If the  
PCs slay the devil near water, you may foreshadow that the devil will be  
back as a multiplicity of 10<sup>th</sup> level river devils. In  
13<sup>th</sup> Age, threats don’t necessarily die the first time you  
deal with them. In the case of Fang Devil, it’s a localized threat  
within one river at a time at 7<sup>th</sup> level. When it becomes a  
multiplying group of 10<sup>th</sup> level creatures, it could spread  
out wherever the campaign requires it.
