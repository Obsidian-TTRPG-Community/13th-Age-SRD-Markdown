<p><em>Natural even hit:</em> The spider can make a <em>rummage and
filch</em> attack against the target as a free action, even if the
target isn’t staggered.</p>
<p><strong>Rummage and filch +11 vs. MD (one staggered
creature)</strong>—The phase spider steals a random true magic item from
the target (see below).</p>
<p><em>Phasing abilities:</em> As long as it didn’t just return from
being out of phase, at the start of the phase spider’s turn, roll a d6
to see which of its phase and teleport abilities it can access that
turn. The spider doesn’t have to use the available ability and can
attack normally, if it wishes.</p>
<p><strong>1–2:</strong> <em>Short teleport</em>—As a move action, the
spider can teleport anywhere it can see nearby.</p>
<p><strong>3:</strong> <em>Long teleport</em>—As a move action, the
spider can teleport anywhere it can see nearby or faraway.</p>
<p><strong>4–5:</strong> <em>Phase out</em>—As a move action, the spider
can remove itself from the battlefield, returning on its next initiative
turn anywhere it chooses nearby. It doesn’t get to make a phase roll at
the start of its next turn though.</p>
<p><strong>6:</strong> <em>Teleport away</em>—If the spider has stolen
at least one magic item, as a move action it can teleport back to its
lair, or to its master if it has one. It leaves the battle. If it hasn’t
stolen an item yet, it won’t leave and can use its choice of the other
abilities this turn.</p>
<p><em>Stolen items:</em> If the spider is slain before it leaves
battle, all items stolen from the party are recovered. If a d20 roll
results in a 20, other magic items are found.</p></td>
