<td><p>Initiative: +5</p>
<p><strong>Shlup’n’schlorp +11 vs. PD</strong>—38 acid damage, and the
cube engulfs the target (functions like a grab; see below) if it’s
smaller than the cube</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> The cube can make a <em>spasms</em> attack as a free
action.</p>
<p><em>[Special trigger]</em> <strong>C: Spasms +11 vs. AC (up to 2
attacks, each against a different nearby enemy)</strong>—19 damage</p>
<p><em>Engulf and dissolve:</em> Targets engulfed/grabbed by the cube
take 38 acid damage at the start of the cube’s turn but are not viable
targets for additional attacks by the cube. Multiple targets can be held
within the cube simultaneously.</p>
<p>Any engulfed creature that is also staggered must begin making last
gasp saves or become paralyzed as the cube’s toxins overwhelm it.</p>
<p><em>Instinctive actions:</em> Gelatinous creatures have no brains,
sometimes they just <em>do things</em>. When the escalation die is odd,
instead of making an attack or moving, roll a d8 to see what the
octahedron does. If an option is not viable (you roll a 3 but there are
no nearby targets), reroll until you get a valid option.</p>
<p><strong>1. C: Acid splash +11 vs. PD (1d3 nearby or faraway enemies
in a group)</strong>—8 ongoing acid damage</p>
<p><em>Each failed save:</em> Acid destroys one of the target’s
non-magical items. The target takes a cumulative –1 attack penalty until
the end of the battle (boots fall apart, shield straps snap, etc.).</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> 5 ongoing acid damage.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> The octahedron grows an orifice that gushes out a
liquid glue that floods the area. Each enemy engaged with the octahedron
is stuck (hard save ends, 16+). Each nearby enemy not engaged with the
octahedron is stuck (save ends). Each faraway enemy is stuck (easy save
ends, 6+). The glue has no effect on creatures who are flying or that
have some way of avoiding it.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> The octahedron squirts a slick slime that targets
1d3 nearby enemies. Until the end of the battle, each target must roll
an easy save each time it moves; on a failure, it’s hampered until the
end of its next turn.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> The octahedron makes a <em>fire gout</em> attack
as it splashes out a gel that ignites in the air and sticks to skin and
clothing.</p>
<p><strong>C: Fire gout +11 vs. PD (1d3 nearby or faraway enemies in a
group)</strong>—8 ongoing fire damage</p>
<p><em>Each failed save:</em> The ongoing damage for all enemies hit by
the attack increases by 1.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> The octahedron sweats acid. Each enemy engaged
with the octahedron must roll a normal save; on a failure, it takes 40
acid damage. On a success it takes 20 acid damage.</p>
<p><strong>6. C: Acid jet +11 vs. PD (one nearby or faraway
enemy)</strong>—45 acid damage</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> 8 ongoing acid damage.</p>
<p><strong>7. C: Acid geyser +11 vs. PD (1d3 nearby or faraway
enemies)</strong>—30 acid damage, and the octahedron is propelled
uncontrollably about the area, passing next to each of its enemies.
Unlike normal, each enemy can make an opportunity attack against the
ooze as it moves this way, but the ooze can make a <em>glomp</em> attack
against those who do as a free action as it passes. (Tell the PCs that
the ooze will get a counter-attack.)</p>
<p><strong>Glomp +9 vs. PD</strong>—10 acid damage, and the cube engulfs
the target if it’s smaller than the cube</p>
<p><strong>8.</strong> The octahedron splits into two tetrahedrons, and
each one can act this turn (roll a d4 for the instinctive actions of
each one). Divide the octahedron’s current hit points equally between
the two new creatures.</p></td>
