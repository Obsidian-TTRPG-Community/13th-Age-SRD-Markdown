<p><strong>Shlup’n’schlorp +10 vs. PD</strong>—30 acid damage, and the
dodecahedron engulfs the target (functions like a grab; see below) if
it’s smaller than the dodecahedron</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> The cube can make a <em>spasms</em> attack as a free
action.</p>
<p><em>[Special trigger]</em> <strong>C: Spasms +10 vs. AC (up to 2
attacks, each against a different nearby enemy)</strong>—15 damage</p>
<p><em>Engulf and dissolve:</em> Targets engulfed/grabbed by the cube
take 30 acid damage at the start of the cube’s turn but are not viable
targets for additional attacks by the cube. Multiple targets can be held
within the cube simultaneously.</p>
<p>Any engulfed creature that is also staggered must begin making last
gasp saves or become paralyzed as the cube’s toxins overwhelm it.</p>
<p><em>Instinctive actions:</em> Gelatinous creatures have no brains,
sometimes they just <em>do things</em>. When the escalation die is odd,
instead of making an attack or moving, roll a d12 to see what the
dodecahedron does. If an option is not available (you roll a 1 but there
are no nearby enemies), reroll until you get a valid option.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> The dodecahedron makes a <em>squash</em> attack
against 1d4 nearby enemies as it rolls and shlorps around the area. Any
enemies already engulfed by the dodecahedron take 10 thunder damage.</p>
<p><strong>C: Squash +10 vs. PD (1d4 nearby enemies)</strong>—20 damage,
and the target is stunned (easy save ends, 6+)</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> The dodecahedron throws out whip-like tendrils
and makes a <em>sudden orifice</em> attack against each enemy engaged
with it. Then it pulls each nearby enemy next to it and engages that
creature.</p>
<p><strong>Sudden orifice +12 vs. PD (each enemy engaged with
it)</strong>—The dodecahedron engulfs the target if it’s smaller than
the dodecahedron</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Hundreds of finger-size slimes slither out from
the interior of the dodecahedron and begin worming their way across the
bodies of each of its enemies in the battle. Until the end of the
battle, when a non-ooze creature takes any damage besides ongoing acid
damage, it also takes 10 acid damage.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> The dodecahedron bounces and thrums. Each enemy
engaged with it or engulfed by it must roll a save; on a failure, that
enemy takes 30 thunder damage. On a success, it takes 15 thunder damage
and pops free from the dodecahedron.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> The dodecahedron hunkers down and produces acidic
spikes. It gains a +4 bonus to all defenses until the end of the battle,
and each enemy who makes a melee attack against it with a non-magical
weapon must roll a save; on a failure the weapon dissolves. When a
creature’s weapon dissolves, that creature is hampered and weakened
(save ends both). Magical weapons lose their bonuses to hit and damage
until the end of the battle instead of being dissolved (but the owner is
still hampered and weakened). They can be “restored” after the battle by
taking a few minutes during a rest to re-attune them.</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> The dodecahedron moves, rolling around the
battlefield, then makes a <em>shlup’n’schlorp</em> attack at the end of
its movement with a +5 bonus. If the attack misses, instead of making a
<em>spasms</em> attack the dodecahedron rolls about the area again and
makes a second <em>shlup’n’schlorp</em> attack with a +10 bonus. If the
second attack misses, it doesn’t get a spasms attack and the
dodecahedron’s turn ends.</p>
<p><strong>7.</strong> The dodecahedron makes a <em>spasms</em> attack.
If it misses with either attack roll, after the attacks, it can make a
<em>stretch and engulf</em> attack as a free action.</p>
<p><strong>C: Stretch and engulf +12 vs. PD (one nearby or faraway
enemy)</strong>—30 acid damage, and the dodecahedron engulfs the target
if it’s smaller than the dodecahedron</p>
<p><strong>8. C: Pseudopod slaps +10 vs. AC (one nearby
enemy)</strong>—25 thunder damage</p>
<p><em>Natural odd hit:</em> The target pops free from the dodecahedron
and is knocked faraway, and the ooze makes the attack again against a
different nearby enemy as a free action.</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit:</em> The dodecahedron engulfs the target if
it’s smaller than the dodecahedron.</p>
<p><strong>9.</strong> Each enemy engulfed by the dodecahedron takes 40
acid damage, and the dodecahedron heals 40 hp for each enemy it has
engulfed.</p>
<p><strong>10.</strong> The dodecahedron splits into an octahedron and a
tetrahedron, and each one can act this turn (roll a d8 and d4 for the
<em>instinctive actions</em> of each one). Divide the dodecahedron’s
current hit points into thirds, and give one third to the tetrahedron
and two thirds to the octahedron.</p>
<p><strong>11.</strong> The dodecahedron splits into three tetrahedrons,
and each one can act this turn (roll a d4 for the <em>instinctive
actions</em> of each one). Divide the dodecahedron’s current hit points
equally between the three new creatures.</p>
<p><strong>12.</strong> The dodecahedron splits into two cubahedrons,
and each one can act this turn (roll a d6 for the <em>instinctive
actions</em> of each one). Divide the dodecahedron’s current hit points
equally between the two new creatures.</p></td>
