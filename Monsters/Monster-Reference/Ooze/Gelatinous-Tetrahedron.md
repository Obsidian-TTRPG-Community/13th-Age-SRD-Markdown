<p><strong>Shlup’n’schlorp +9 vs. PD</strong>—22 acid damage, and the
tetrahedron engulfs the target (functions like a grab; see below) if
it’s smaller than the tetrahedron</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> The tetrahedron can make a <em>spasms</em> attack as a
free action.</p>
<p><em>[Special trigger]</em> <strong>C: Spasms +9 vs. AC (up to 2
attacks, each against a different nearby enemy)</strong>—11 damage</p>
<p><em>Engulf and dissolve:</em> Targets engulfed/grabbed by the
tetrahedron take 22 acid damage at the start of the cube’s turn but are
not viable targets for additional attacks by the tetrahedron. Multiple
targets can be held within the tetrahedron simultaneously.</p>
<p>Any engulfed creature that is also staggered must begin making last
gasp saves or become paralyzed as the tetrahedron’s toxins overwhelm
it.</p>
<p><em>Instinctive actions:</em> Gelatinous creatures have no brains,
sometimes they just <em>do things</em>. When the escalation die is odd,
instead of making an attack or moving, roll a d4 to see what the
tetrahedron does. If an option is not viable (you roll a 1 but there is
no engaged enemy), reroll until you get a valid option.</p>
<p><strong>1. C: Fling +9 vs. PD (one engaged enemy)</strong>—14 damage,
and the target pops free from the ooze and must roll an easy save (6+);
on a failure, it loses its next move action</p>
<p><strong>2. C: Fling +9 vs. PD (one nearby enemy not engaged with the
ooze)</strong>—28 damage, and the target is flung somewhere nearby and
must roll an easy save (6+); on a failure, it loses its next move
action</p>
<p><strong>3. C: Fling +9 vs. PD (one faraway enemy)</strong>—42 damage,
and the target is flung somewhere faraway and must roll an easy save
(6+); on a failure, it loses its next move action</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> As a standard action the ooze quickly moves
around the battlefield, oozing over 1d3 nearby enemies. Those enemies
become engaged with the ooze and stuck (save ends).</p>
<p><em>First failed save:</em> The target is engulfed instead of
stuck.</p></td>
