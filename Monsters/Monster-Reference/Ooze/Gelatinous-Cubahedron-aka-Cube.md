## Gelatinous Cubahedron (aka Cube)

<p><strong>Shlup’n’schlorp +10 vs. PD</strong>—30 acid damage, and the
cube engulfs the target (functions like a grab; see below) if it’s
smaller than the cube</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> The cube can make a spasms attack as a free
action.</p>
<p><em>[Special trigger]</em> <strong>C: Spasms +10 vs. AC (up to 2
attacks, each against a different nearby enemy)</strong>—15 damage</p>
<p><em>Engulf and dissolve:</em> Targets engulfed/grabbed by the cube
take 30 acid damage at the start of the cube’s turn but are not viable
targets for additional attacks by the cube. Multiple targets can be held
within the cube simultaneously.</p>
<p>Any engulfed creature that is also staggered must begin making last
gasp saves or become paralyzed as the cube’s toxins overwhelm it.</p>
<p><em>Instinctive actions:</em> Gelatinous creatures have no brains,
sometimes they just <em>do things</em>. When the escalation die is odd,
instead of making an attack or moving, roll a d6 to see what the
cubahedron does. If an option is not viable (you roll a 5 but there is
no engulfed enemy), reroll until you get a valid option.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> The cubahedron jiggles in place. Each nearby
enemy takes 5 acid damage. Each creature engulfed by the cube takes a –4
penalty to its saves until the end of its next turn.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> The cubahedron moves as a quick action. If the
cube ends its move engaged with enemies, each of those enemies must roll
a save; on a failure, the cubahedron grabs them (but they’re not
engulfed).</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> The cubahedron spits an engulfed creature into
the air above it and makes a <em>shlup’n’schlorp</em> attack against
that creature with a +5 attack bonus. Then the creature is engulfed
again.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> The cubahedron flattens itself slightly and
crawls up a wall and possibly across the ceiling. The cube falls at the
end of its turn. Each creature engulfed by the cube takes 30 damage, and
it makes a <em>gel drop</em> attack against enemies below it.</p>
<p><strong>Gel drop +10 vs. PD (1d3 nearby enemies)</strong>—15 damage,
and the cube engulfs the target if it’s smaller than the cube</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> The cubahedron moves one creature engulfed by it
to the surface. The target gains a +4 bonus to attempts to escape the
cube, but each time the cube is targeted by an attack, the engulfed
creature must roll a save; on a failure, it becomes the target of the
attack instead.</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> The cubahedron spits out each enemy engulfed by
it with great force in different directions; each of those creatures
takes 50 damage.</p></td>
