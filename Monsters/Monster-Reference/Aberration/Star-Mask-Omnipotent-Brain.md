<td><p>Initiative: +16</p>
<p><strong>Invasive tentacles +17 vs. AC (1d3 nearby
enemies)</strong>—30 damage, and 30 ongoing psychic damage</p>
<p><em>Target fails a save against the ongoing psychic damage:</em> At
the start of the target’s next turn, it must use its move action to
engage the omnipotent brain. It won’t take opportunity attacks to do so,
instead trying to disengage.</p>
<p><strong>C: Psionic supremacy +17 vs. MD (one nearby or faraway
enemy)</strong>—35 ongoing psychic damage</p>
<p><em>Aftereffect:</em> When the target saves against the ongoing
damage, it must choose one: it makes a basic attack against itself or an
ally with its next standard action, OR it becomes weakened (–4 to
attacks and defenses) until the end of its next turn.</p>
<p><em>Limited use:</em> 2/round, as separate quick actions.</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> The brain heals 50 hp.</p>
<p><em>Natural 1–5:</em> The target is immune to the aftereffect of
<em>psionic supremacy</em> until the end of the battle.</p>
<p><em>Crawling brain:</em> The brain can crawl about on tentacles but
prefers to use its telekinetic grasp to move enemies toward it or its
allies.</p>
<p><em>Psychic contamination:</em> Creatures engaged with the star-mask
omnipotent brain that have 120 hp or fewer can’t target the omnipotent
brain with attacks.</p>
<p><em>Telekinetic grasp:</em> As a move action the brain can move an
ally or enemy, causing them to fly about. An enemy can roll a save to
avoid being moved against its will. If it succeeds, there’s no effect.
Enemies hurled against solid objects or other allies take 2d20 damage,
or possibly more if hurled into dangerous terrain.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p><em>Absorb:</em> When an enemy engaged with the star-mask brain
omnipotent rolls a natural 1–5 on a disengage check, it’s absorbed into
the omnipotent brain’s flesh. Absorbed characters are stuck, weakened,
and move with the omnipotent (hard save ends all, 16+). Creatures can
also be freed from an omnipotent brain’s flesh with a DC 30 skill check
as a standard action. If the check fails by 5 or more, the assisting
ally is also now absorbed with the same effects.</p>
<p><em>Perceptual warp:</em> When an enemy targets the omnipotent brain
with a ranged attack and rolls a natural 1–5, it must reroll the attack
against an ally engaged with the brain, if any, as if it had
fumbled.</p>
<p><em>Psychic command:</em> The omnipotent brain can use a standard
action to allow a nearby ally to make an attack as a free action with a
+4 attack bonus. If the ally misses it takes 1d8 damage and the brain
heals 50 hp.</p></td>
