<p><strong>Tentacle caress +9 vs. PD</strong>—12 damage, and the target
is vulnerable to psychic damage (save ends)</p>
<p><strong>C: Whispered secrets +10 vs. MD (1d3 nearby
enemies)</strong>—5 psychic damage, and the target’s mind is filled with
a delusional scene from its past that depends on the roll</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit:</em> The target is confused until the end of
its next turn as it sees a foe from its past.</p>
<p><em>Natural odd hit:</em> The target is weakened until the end of its
next turn as it remembers a past failure.</p>
<p><em>Rewards of the patron:</em> So long as the attack hits one or
more targets, one ally of the prophet’s choice gains a cumulative +1
attack bonus until the end of the battle that increases that ally’s
natural attack roll (so a roll of natural 15 becomes a roll of natural
16 with a +1 bonus, or a natural 17 with a +2 bonus, etc.). The ally can
choose not to use the bonus.</p>
<p><em>Saw it coming:</em> Twice per battle as a free action, the
prophet can try to avoid a non-critical attack that hits it. The
attacker must reroll the attack roll with a –4 penalty.</p>
<p><em>Knows the angles:</em> Twice per battle as a move action, the
prophet can teleport to anywhere it can see, or to a location it can’t
see but that has the correct geometry and that it has previously
prepared (a lair).</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p><em>Haruspicy master:</em> When an enemy has dropped to 0 hp or lower
since the prophet’s last turn, as a quick action it can get a glimpse of
the near-future. It grants 1d3 nearby allies a +4 bonus to attacks and
to all defenses until the start of its next turn.</p>
<p><em>A special secret:</em> When the prophet makes a <em>whispered
secrets</em> attack, it can choose to target only one nearby enemy. If
it does, it gains a +4 attack bonus against that enemy and the hit
effects are save ends.</p></td>
