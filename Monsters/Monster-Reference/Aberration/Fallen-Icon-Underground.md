<p><strong>Hammer of golden sovereignty +18 vs. AC (up to 3
enemies)</strong>—90 damage</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit:</em> The target pops free and takes extra
damage equal to the attack roll.</p>
<p><em>First natural even miss each round if targeting one or two
enemies:</em> The Fallen Icon makes another <em>hammer of golden
sovereignty</em> attack against the enemy it missed.</p>
<p><strong>C: Behind the mask +18 vs. MD (one nearby enemy)</strong>—160
psychic damage and the target is weakened (save ends)</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> 80 psychic damage and the target is weakened until the
end of its next turn.</p>
<p><em>[Special trigger]</em> <strong>C: Golden greed +18 vs. MD (one
nearby enemy)</strong>—The target is confused (save ends)</p>
<p><em>Limited use:</em> When a nearby enemy uses the magic item power
of an epic tier item, the Fallen Icon may make a <em>golden greed</em>
attack against 1d4 other nearby enemies as a free action. (It’s possible
the PCs should have some warning, for example, a magic item might be
too-eagerly wheedling to be used. Or maybe you’d rather teach lessons
the hard way.)</p>
<p><em>The mask slips:</em> When first staggered, the Fallen Icon makes
a <em>behind the mask</em> attack against the enemy that caused the
triggering damage as a free action.</p>
<p><em>The wandering king:</em> The Fallen Icon can deal 4d6 damage to
itself and teleport someplace it can see nearby as a move action.</p>
<p><em>Sticks and rags:</em> The Fallen Icon has <em>resist damage
16+</em> to attacks not made with epic-tier magical weapons, implements,
or bracers. Enemies not wearing epic-tier magical armor are vulnerable
to its <em>hammer of golden sovereignty</em> attacks (that’s
right—eschewing magic items makes it easier to defeat the minions of the
Fallen Icon, but harder to beat the Fallen Icon itself).</p>
<p><em>Even worse:</em> When the escalation die is even, the Fallen Icon
rolls 2d20 instead of 1d20 and uses the higher result whenever it
attacks or rolls a save.</p>
<p>Fallen icon: The Fallen Icon is no longer an icon, but it still
possesses magical bonds with reality that make it difficult to destroy.
See the Campaign Impact section immediately following the Fallen Icon’s
stat block for ways in which significant campaign victories can make the
Fallen Icon easier to defeat. (To be clear: if the PCs don’t achieve any
of these campaign victories, the Fallen Icon will be difficult or
perhaps even impossible to destroy.)</p>
<p><em>Compel fealty:</em> An epic-tier dwarf, forgeborn, or human slain
by the Fallen Icon will arise at the end of the battle as a bronze
kingsguard, loyal gatherer, or royal bearer—whichever seems most
appropriate.</p>
<p><em>Eternal kingdom:</em> If the Fallen Icon King is slain, the GM
secretly rolls a normal save (11+) at the end of <em>each session</em>,
including this one. If the save succeeds, the Fallen Icon returns to
life in one of its secret treasure rooms deep in the underworld. If the
campaign somehow ends while the Fallen Icon is still dead, it’s the GM’s
call whether the Fallen Icon stays dead or rises after the events of the
campaign.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p><em>Fealty owed:</em> Human, dwarf, and forgeborn characters may not
use their racial power until the escalation die reaches 4 or higher, and
not when engaged with the Fallen Icon (so standard humans are simply out
of luck).</p>
<p><em>Fealty shown:</em> The first time each round an attack would
reduce the Fallen Icon to zero hit points or less, it instead damages
the closest nearby loyal gatherer. If these have all been destroyed, the
attack damages the closest nearby royal bearer, then finally the closest
bronze kingsguard. If these have all been destroyed, the Fallen Icon is
reduced to zero hit points—but see <em>long live the icon</em>
below.</p>
<p><em>Long Live the Icon:</em> When the Fallen Icon is finally
defeated, nothing remains but a featureless gold mask that wants to be
picked up. This mask makes a <em>golden greed</em> attack against each
enemy in the battle as a free action. The save to end the confusion from
this attack is a hard save, with confused targets violently fighting
over the mask. When no targets are confused, the mask crumbles into
dust. (If one PC slays the others while confused, they’re probably going
to put on the mask.)</p></td>

## Faun

<u>Ability for all fauns: destiny</u>

Fauns who are likely to end up in a fight choose one of two paths. The  
paths determine which of their defenses will be higher, and in some  
cases determine an additional ability or two.

*Path of the Sword:* More martial-minded, these fauns are usually  
warriors, thieves, and hunters. They have a higher Physical Defense  
(PD).

*Path of Song:* Magically-inclined, these fauns are usually bards,  
magicians, priests, or druids. They have a higher Mental Defense (MD).
