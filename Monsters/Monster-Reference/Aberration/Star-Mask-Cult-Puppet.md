<p><strong>C: Tentacle whip +13 vs. PD</strong>—15 damage, and the
target pops free from each enemy engaged with it and is pulled into
engagement with the star-mask puppet</p>
<p><em>Psychic coordination:</em> For every star-mask puppet engaged
with an enemy, other star-masks not engaged with that enemy gain a +1
attack bonus against that enemy (maximum +4).</p>
<p><em>Wall-crawler:</em> The star-mask puppet can use oily tentacles to
climb on ceilings and walls as easily as it moves on the ground.</p>
<p><em>Psychic chaff:</em> Star-mask parasites that create puppets
quickly die and fade to dust after their puppet drops to 0 hp. After a
battle against star-mask puppets, each character must roll a hard save
(16+). If they fail, they remember only the host body and not the white
mask and black tentacles that were embedded in its flesh. Even
characters who succeed find it hard to keep the memory of the star-mask
in mind afterward, potentially making for confusing battles against
these puppets.</p></td>
