<p><em>Natural even hit:</em> The skull crab has burrowed its tentacles
into the target’s flesh; the target takes a –1 penalty to all d20 rolls
(save ends). Until the target saves, whenever it moves the skull crab
comes with it, and the crab will continue to bite the target.</p>
<p><em>Each failed save:</em> The penalty to all d20 rolls increases by
–1 (first failed save = –2 penalty, etc.)</p>
<p><em>Meat puppet:</em> If a creature fails three consecutive saves
against the <em>scrabbling tentacles</em> effect, attacks against the
skull crab deal half damage to it and half to that creature as the crab
burrows deep. The effect lasts until the creature saves.</p>
<p><em>Sudden leap:</em> Once per battle as a move action, the skull
crab can engage a nearby or far away enemy.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Special</u></p>
<p><em>New host:</em> When an enemy making saves against the scrambling
tentacles effect drops to 0 hp or below, the skull crab eggs rush out of
its skull and the crab dies. That enemy must start making last gasp
saves in addition to any death saves, with it turning into a xombie on
the fourth failure.</p></td>
