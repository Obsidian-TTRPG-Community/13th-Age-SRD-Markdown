<p><em>Instant rebirth:</em> Any enemy that dies due to ongoing damage
from <em>mutagenic emanations</em> instantly rejoins the fight as a
star-mask brain zealot allied to the dungeon heart.</p>
<p><strong>C: Sickly sweet feelings +22 vs. MD (one nearby or faraway
enemy)</strong>—Until the end of the battle, the next time the target
drops to 0 hp or below, the target recovers with temporary hit points
equal to its normal maximum hit points, but is now an ally to the
dungeon heart. It is a standard action to free an ally next to you from
their <em>sickly sweet feelings</em>, but doing so makes them lose their
temporary hp (at which point they’ll collapse again unless they have
been somehow healed above 0 hit points).</p>
<p><em>Quick use:</em> 1/round, as a quick action.</p>
<p><em>Mental scream:</em> The first time the dungeon heart is
staggered, it makes the following attack as a free action:</p>
<p><strong>R: Mind-erasing blast +22 vs. MD (the enemy that staggered
the dungeon heart)</strong>—200 psychic damage</p>
<p><em>Lost opportunity:</em> The dungeon heart can’t make opportunity
attacks.</p>
<p><em>Neuralogenic:</em> The brain doesn’t move about by itself, but it
does infect nearby matter, turning wherever it is into more of itself:
if you are close enough to fight the brain, you are de facto engaged
with it, and will be affected by its <em>mutagenic emanations</em>
attack.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p><em>Flesh absorption:</em> When an enemy fails to save against the
ongoing damage from <em>mutagenic emanations</em>, the dungeon heart
heals 20 hp.</p>
<p><em>Soul drain:</em> Enemies killed by the dungeon heart become
mindless living husks with no resurrection or healing possible—their
soul is gone. (Of course, there may be some miraculous quest for healing
magic that could restore them.)</p></td>
