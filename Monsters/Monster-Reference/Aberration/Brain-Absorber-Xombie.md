<p><em>Natural even hit:</em> The target loses a recovery, OR it must
immediately roll a save; if it fails, it’s confused (save ends)
(target’s choice).</p>
<p><em>[Group ability]</em> <strong>C: Mass confusion +9 vs. MD (1d3
nearby enemies)</strong>—14 psychic damage, OR if the target is the
first enemy this attack hits each round, it must make a basic attack
against an ally of its choice.</p>
<p><em>[Group ability]</em> <strong>C: Psychic crush +9 vs. MD (one
nearby or far away enemy)</strong>—14 psychic damage</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit or miss:</em> 10 ongoing psychic damage.</p>
<p><em>Group ability:</em> For every two brain-absorber xombies in the
battle (round up), one of them can use <em>brain-ripping tentacles</em>,
<em>mass confusion</em>, or <em>psychic crush</em> once during the
battle.</p>
<p><em>Harvest:</em> When the brain-absorber xombie is next to an
unconscious or helpless living enemy at the start of its turn, it can
use its full turn of actions (quick, move, and standard) to remove the
creature’s brain and add it to its collection. When it does, that enemy
dies and the xombie heals to full hit points.</p>
<p><em>Re-broadcaster:</em> Once per battle, the brain-absorber xombie
can take no actions during its turn to allow 1d4 nearby lower-level
allies to take an extra standard action during their next
turns.</p></td>
