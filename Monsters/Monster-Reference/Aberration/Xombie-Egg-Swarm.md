<p><em>[Group ability]</em> <strong>C: Puppeteer tentacles +7 vs. MD
(one nearby enemy)</strong>—The target makes a basic attack against a
target of the xombie egg swarm’s choice</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> The target is immune to puppeteer abilities for the
rest of this battle and until the end of the next battle.</p>
<p><em>Swarm rush:</em> Once per battle as a move action, the egg swarm
can pop free from each enemy engaged with it and take two move actions,
but it must finish its move engaged with an enemy.</p>
<p><em>Group ability:</em> For every four xombie egg swarms in the
battle (round up), one of them can use <em>puppeteer tentacles</em> once
during the battle.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Special</u></p>
<p><em>Corpse puppet:</em> If there is at least one intact corpse in the
battle (say a star-mask cultist died), then once per battle part of the
xombie egg swarm can burrow into it as a quick action, and it rises as a
skull crab xombie at the start of the next round (roll initiative and
give the new xombie a +10 initiative bonus for the shock of its
arrival).</p></td>
