<p><strong>Piercing claws +11 vs. AC (2 attacks)</strong>—17 damage</p>
<p><em>First natural odd hit each turn:</em> The hellwarped can make one
<em>aberrant attack</em> as a free action.</p>
<p><em>Dual miss:</em> The hellwarped gains a cumulative +1 attack bonus
to its <em>claw</em> attacks until the end of the battle.</p>
<p><strong>Aberrant attacks</strong>—While building a battle with a
hellwarped beast, roll once on the Aberrant Attacks table to see what
type of attack it has. The spawn can use its <em>aberrant attack</em>
normally, or trigger it with a piercing claws attack.</p>
<p><em>Infected by hell:</em> As creatures created by the energies of
hellholes, hellwarped beasts are usually also affected by powers that
affect demons. GM, it’s your call. In exchange, feel free to allow the
hellwarped to deal fire, cold, acid, lightning, or thunder damage with
its aberrant attacks.</p>
<p><em>Mutated form:</em> Since different creatures become hellwarped
beasts, some are tougher or hardier than others. Before battle, roll a
d6 and adjust the hellwarped’s stats accordingly.</p>
<p>1. –2 to all defenses</p>
<p>2. +2 to all defenses</p>
<p>3. –10% to hit points (–18)</p>
<p>4. +10% to hit points (+18)</p>
<p>5. –1 to all attacks</p>
<p>6. +1 to all attacks</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p><em>Special movement:</em> The hellwarped has flight, burrow, an
extra move action, the ability to teleport as a move action, or some
other movement related ability of your choice. Decrease all its defenses
by 1 due to the weak points this anatomy creates.</p>
<p><em>Tough for its kind:</em> For its mutated form ability, choose one
instead of rolling.</p></td>
