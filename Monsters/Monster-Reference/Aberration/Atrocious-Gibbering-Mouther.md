<p><strong>Tearing mouths +11 vs. AC (2 attacks)</strong>—11 damage</p>
<p><em>Natural 19+:</em> Target is grabbed.</p>
<p><strong>C: Pseudopod grasp +11 vs. PD (1 nearby
enemy)</strong>—Target is grabbed and moved into engagement with the
gibbering mouther</p>
<p><em>Quick use:</em> 1/round, as a quick action.</p>
<p><strong>Absorb +11 vs. PD (up to two grabbed enemies)</strong>—20
acid damage and the crit range for this attack expands by 1 (to a
maximum of 11+)</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> 10 acid damage.</p>
<p><em>Crit:</em> Target must start making last gasp saves as they are
slowly absorbed. Absorbed creatures can’t be resurrected by normal
means.</p>
<p><strong>C: Gibbering insanity +11 vs. MD (2 random nearby
enemies)</strong>—Target is shocked (save ends)</p>
<p><em>Quick use:</em> 1/round, as a quick action.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p><em>Really insane terrain:</em> A gibbering mouther causes
surrounding rocks and dirt to soften. On rounds when the escalation die
is odd characters must succeed at a save (11+) when they attempt to move
or their movement ends and they become stuck (save ends). On turns when
the ground softens the gibbering mouther can move once on its turn as a
quick action, as well as once as a move action.</p>
<p><em>Stone to flesh:</em> A gibbering mouther that also has the
<em>insane terrain</em> nastier special slowly turns the softening
terrain to flesh, then absorbs it. When the escalation die becomes 6,
the die flips straight back to 1 and the gibbering mouther heals up to
half its full hit points.</p></td>
