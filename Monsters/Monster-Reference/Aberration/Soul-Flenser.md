<p><strong>Soul flensing tentacles +14 vs. PD</strong>—30 damage</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit, or any hit against a weakened, stunned, or
confused target:</em> Randomly select one of the target’s limited-use
powers or spells. The soul flenser flenses it away, removing it from the
target until that creature regains it via a successful <em>Connection to
the Oversoul</em> (see below).</p>
<p><em>Natural 3, 6, or 9:</em> The target is confused (save ends).</p>
<p><strong>C: Soul blast +14 vs. MD (1d4 nearby enemies in a
group)</strong>—35 psychic damage</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit:</em> The target is weakened (save ends).</p>
<p><em>Natural odd hit:</em> If the target is already weakened, it’s
also stunned until end of its next turn.</p>
<p><em>Natural 3, 6, or 9:</em> The target is confused (save ends).</p>
<p><em>Connection to the Oversoul:</em> When a creature slays a soul
flenser, it can roll a hard save (16+). If it succeeds, the creature
regains one power it has had <em>flensed</em> away.</p>
<p><em>Intellect fortress:</em> When an enemy misses the soul flenser
with an attack against MD, that attacker takes half the miss damage, if
any.</p>
<p><em>Underkraken teleport:</em> A soul flenser that has successfully
flensed at least once can (and usually will, provided some of its
enemies are confused, weakened, or stunned) use a standard action to
prepare itself to teleport. Once it does this, during its next turn it
can use a move action to teleport back to its home underkraken, no
matter how distant, leaving the battle behind. Soul flensers fighting
beside or within their underkraken can’t use this ability; they’re
already home.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p><em>Flensing escalator:</em> The soul flenser gains an attack bonus
equal to the escalation die against creatures that have had one or more
powers flensed away.</p>
<p><em>Oversoul control:</em> While confused by a soul flenser’s effect,
a creature that has had a power flensed away can use and re-use that
limited power against their erstwhile allies, if the GM sees how to use
the power in a useful way.</p></td>
