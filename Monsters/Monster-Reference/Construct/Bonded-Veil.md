<p><em>Natural even hit:</em> The bonded pops free and flies until the
end of its turn as a free action. It must land at the end of its turn,
or take falling damage.</p>
<p><em>Natural 20:</em> The target becomes weakened and vulnerable (save
ends), and the bonded can fly until the end of its next turn.</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> 15 damage.</p>
<p><em>Special, once per battle:</em> The bonded makes this attack as a
free action on somebody else’s turn.</p>
<p><strong>Cut to ribbons +10 vs. AC (4 attacks)</strong>—20 damage</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit or miss:</em> The bonded must pop free and as a
free action move into engagement with a different enemy it has not
already attacked this turn, then continues its <em>cut to ribbons</em>
attack if it still has any of its four attacks left. If there are no
other enemies that can be attacked, the <em>cut to ribbons</em> attack
ends.</p>
<p><em>Special, once per battle:</em> The bonded makes this attack as a
free action on somebody else’s turn.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Special</u></p>
<p><em>Veiled:</em> Until the bonded is hit, it has a +4 bonus to all
defenses.</p></td>
