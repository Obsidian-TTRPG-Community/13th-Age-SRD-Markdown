<p><strong>Mighty slam +11 vs. AC</strong>—18 damage</p>
<p><em>Natural 16+:</em> The target is dazed until the end of its next
turn.</p>
<p><em>[Special trigger]</em> <strong>Empowered slam +12 vs.
AC</strong>—27 damage</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit:</em> The warder pops free from each enemy
engaged with it and can move as a free action, usually next to an
ally.</p>
<p><em>Limited golem immunity:</em> A golem warder can’t be dazed,
weakened, confused, or made vulnerable. Ongoing damage doesn’t harm it
either, unless it’s acid, fire, or lightning.</p>
<p><em>Protect the master:</em> While the golem warder is next to an
ally, once per round when a melee attack targets that ally, it can try
to intercept the attack as a free action. Roll an easy save (6+); if it
succeeds, the warder becomes the target of the attack instead.</p>
<p><em>Spellward:</em> Twice per battle when a spell attack hits a
nearby ally, the warder can have the attack target itself instead as an
interrupt action. If the attack roll doesn’t hit against the warder’s
defenses, the attack misses. Otherwise, the warder takes all damage and
effects of the spell for that ally. When the warder takes damage this
way, it can make an <em>empowered slam</em> attack during its next
turn.</p>
<p>Golem warders are usually linked to a master through a ritual. Unless
instructed otherwise, they use <em>spellward</em> only to protect that
master.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Special</u></p>
<p><em>Hard to destroy:</em> Only natural even spell attack rolls deal
damage to the golem.</p></td>
