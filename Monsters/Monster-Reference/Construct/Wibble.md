<p><strong>R: Force burp spell +6 vs. PD</strong>—4 force damage</p>
<p><em>Disengaged:</em> Wibbles gain a +5 bonus to disengage checks.
They also don’t remain engaged with their foes and will move every turn
in battle. When they fail a disengage check, a wibble moves away
anyway.</p>
<p><em>Eruptive blorp:</em> When an enemy hits a wibble with a melee
attack, it takes force damage equal to its level.</p>
<p><em>Flight:</em> Wibbles waft about. They can fly well enough to
ignore most wind, but not strong gale winds.</p>
<p><em>Whiff and wibble:</em> When a creature makes a non-spell attack
against a wibble and rolls a natural 1–2, 1d3 new wibbles are created in
the same area. These new wibbles typically melt back into their “parent”
at the end of a battle if not destroyed, but sometimes they remain
separate and drift off on their own.</p></td>
