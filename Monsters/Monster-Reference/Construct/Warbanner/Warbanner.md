### Warbanner

Warbanners have a number of abilities in common. The feral warbanner has
the full version of these abilities. You may customize the feral
warbanner by giving it icon-associated abilities.

A warbanner generally commands large groups of mooks that are simple to
play. Creatures in a warbanner’s band are allies fully under its
control. It could also have allies not in its band.

<p><strong>C: Banner magic</strong>—Roll 2d20 and use each roll (or a
lower result of your choice) to determine one effect</p>
<p><em>1–5:</em> The warbanner’s bearer can make a basic attack with a
+2 attack bonus as a free action.</p>
<p><em>6–10:</em> Each different enemy engaged with a creature in the
warbanner’s band takes 1d6 psychic damage.</p>
<p><em>11–15:</em> If any mooks in the warbanner’s band have dropped
this battle, return one of those mooks to the battle next to the
warbanner. (If the warbanner has no mooks in its band, choose a lower
result.)</p>
<p><em>16–20:</em> The warbanner can make a <em>false rally</em> attack
as a free action.</p>
<p><em>[Special trigger]</em> <strong>C: False rally +7 vs. MD (one
nearby enemy with 12 hp or fewer)</strong>—The target is confused (hard
save ends, 16+)</p>
<p><em>Critical hit:</em> The target can now only save against the
confusion with a natural 20 (or until the warbanner drops) and can’t
flee if the rest of the PCs choose to do so.</p>
<p><em>Designated bearer:</em> Once per round as a quick action, the
warbanner can fly directly above a lower-level ally in its band and
designate that ally as its bearer. Alternately, it can release itself
from a bearer and fly free.</p>
<p><em>Bearer beware:</em> While the warbanner has a bearer it moves
with the bearer and is engaged by enemies that engage the bearer. The
bearer is vulnerable to all attacks but it can use the escalation
die.</p>
<p><em>Conditional resist damage 16+:</em> Unless an ally in the
warbanner’s band dropped to 0 hp since the start of the current round,
an enemy attacking the warbanner must roll a natural 16+ on the attack
roll or it only takes half damage. This ability has no effect if the
warbanner has no allies in its band.</p>
<p><em>Flight:</em> Warbanners fly quickly, fluttering in winds only
they can feel, preferably never touching the ground. They can’t fly off
the ground higher than a flag on a pole can be carried into battle, so
enemies on the ground can still target them. At best, a warbanner might
gain a +2 bonus to defenses against attacks made by small PCs like
halflings and gnomes.</p>
<p><em>Mook morale:</em> Mooks fighting in the warbanner’s band gain a
bonus to their hit points equal to the warbanner’s level (2).</p></td>
