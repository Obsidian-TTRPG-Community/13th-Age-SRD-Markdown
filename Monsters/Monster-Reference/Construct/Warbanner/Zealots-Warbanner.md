<p><strong>Whipping hook +8 vs. AC</strong>—10 damage, and 10 ongoing
damage</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> 5 damage.</p>
<p><strong>C: Banner magic</strong>—Roll 2d20 and use each roll (or a
lower result of your choice) to determine one effect</p>
<p><em>1–5:</em> The warbanner’s bearer can make a basic attack with a
+2 attack bonus as a free action.</p>
<p><em>6–10:</em> Each different enemy engaged with a creature in the
warbanner’s band takes 1d8 psychic damage.</p>
<p><em>11–15:</em> Until the end of the battle, each ally in the
warbanner’s band gains a +2 cumulative bonus to damage on hits with
melee attacks.</p>
<p><em>16–20:</em> The warbanner can make a <em>false rally</em> attack
as a free action.</p>
<p><em>[Special trigger]</em> <strong>C: False rally +8 vs. MD (one
nearby enemy with 15 hp or fewer)</strong>—The target is confused (hard
save ends, 16+)</p>
<p><em>Critical hit:</em> The target can now only save against the
confusion with a natural 20 (or until the warbanner drops) and can’t
flee if the rest of the PCs choose to do so.</p>
<p><em>Designated bearer:</em> Once per round as a quick action, the
warbanner can fly directly above a lower-level ally in its band and
designate that ally as its bearer. Alternately, it can release itself
from a bearer and fly free.</p>
<p><em>Bearer beware:</em> While the warbanner has a bearer it moves
with the bearer and is engaged by enemies that engage the bearer. The
bearer is vulnerable to all attacks but it can use the escalation
die.</p>
<p><em>Conditional resist damage 16+:</em> As feral warbanner.</p>
<p><em>Flight:</em> As feral warbanner.</p>
<p><em>Mook morale:</em> Mooks fighting in the warbanner’s band gain a
bonus to their hit points equal to the warbanner’s level (3).</p></td>
