<p><strong>Smite the unworthy, bless the worthy +18 vs. AC (1d4 engaged
enemies or allies the bonded is touching)</strong>—50 force damage</p>
<p><em>Hit against ally:</em> Instead of taking 50 damage, the target
heals 30 damage. Each ally can only benefit from this healing once per
battle.</p>
<p><strong>R: Eerie radiance +18 vs. PD (1d3 nearby or faraway enemies
or dead allies)</strong>—30 damage</p>
<p><em>Hit against dead ally:</em> If the attack beat the PD of a dead
ally, instead of taking damage the ally returns to life with 20 hp (or
their maximum hp if it is lower than 20). Each ally can only be targeted
by eerie radiance once per battle. This effect only works on allies who
have died during the battle.</p>
<p><strong>C: Maladiction+18 vs. MD (one nearby or faraway
enemy)</strong>—70 damage, and the next ally of the bonded prophet to
hit the target heals 4d10 hp</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p><em>Returned saints:</em> The bonded’s eerie radiance also works
against long-dead creatures, even returning corpses that are no more
than dust and bones to full life. GMs beware, this is a very nasty
special if the bonded prophet happens to be standing in a graveyard at
the time.</p>
<p><em>Divine retribution:</em> The bonded prophet’s mighty smite is
even mightier if the PC has violated some taboo, broken a sacred law, or
transgressed into a holy place. The attack deals an additional 20 force
damage, hit or miss, even on a 1.</p></td>
