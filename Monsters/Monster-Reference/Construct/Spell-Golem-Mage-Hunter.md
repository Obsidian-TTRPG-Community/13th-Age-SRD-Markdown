<p><strong>Negating strike +14 vs. AC (2 attacks)</strong>—40 damage,
and the target is hampered until the end of its next turn</p>
<p><em>Natural roll is above target’s Intelligence:</em> The target is
hampered (hard save ends, 16+) instead.</p>
<p><strong>R: Ray of disjunction +14 vs. PD</strong>—70 damage, and the
target is hampered (save ends)</p>
<p><em>Natural 16+:</em> 1d2 random magic items on the target are also
affected. One-shot items like potions and oils are ruined; true magic
items lose their default bonus and any powers until the end of the
battle.</p>
<p><em>Limited use:</em> 2/battle.</p>
<p><em>Limited golem immunity:</em> A golem warder can’t be dazed,
weakened, confused, or made vulnerable. Ongoing damage doesn’t harm it
either, unless it’s acid, fire, or lightning.</p>
<p><em>Spell deflection:</em> When a spell attack targets the mage
hunter, roll a d20. On a 1–7, the attack or effect hits normally. On an
8–15, the attack or effect is negated. On a 16+, the attack or effect is
reflected back at the caster as if that enemy had been targeted instead
of the golem (so it must overcome defenses and resistances, as
normal).</p>
<p><u>Nastier Special</u></p>
<p><em>Made of tougher stuff:</em> Instead of wood, stronger materials
were used to create the golem, such as crystal or brass. This golem is
non-organic and has golem immunity (so ongoing acid, fire, and lightning
don’t harm it).</p></td>
