attacks)</strong>—40 damage</p>
<p><strong>R: Returning axe +10 vs. AC (one nearby or faraway
enemy)</strong>—40 damage</p>
<p><strong>C: Gleaming perfection +10 vs. MD (one nearby or faraway
enemy)</strong>—The target must use its next move action to move closer
to the bronze errant</p>
<p><em>Limited use:</em> When an enemy not engaged with the bronze
errant rolls a natural odd attack roll against it, the bronze errant can
make a <em>gleaming perfection</em> attack against that enemy as a free
action.</p>
<p><em>Armor supremacy:</em> Enemies engaged with the bronze errant and
wearing magical heavy armor who roll a natural odd attack are vulnerable
until the start of their next turn, as they exaggeratedly act out their
armor’s quirk.</p>
<p><em>Perfect immunity:</em> Bronze errants are immune to effects. They
can’t be dazed, weakened, confused, made vulnerable, or touched by
ongoing damage. You can damage one, but that’s about it.</p></td>
