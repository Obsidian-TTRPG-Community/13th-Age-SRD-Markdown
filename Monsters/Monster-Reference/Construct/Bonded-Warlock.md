<p><em>Natural even hit or miss:</em> The target is teleported to the
far side of the battlefield, and hampered (save ends).</p>
<p><em>Natural 16+ hit:</em> Make a <em>violent dispelling</em> attack
as a quick action against the target, if it hits it does no damage but
does dispel spells and spell-like effects.</p>
<p><strong>C: Violent dispelling +18 vs. MD (one nearby or faraway
enemy)</strong>—70 damage, and any spell-like effects on the target or
caused by the target end</p>
<p><strong>R: Hexplosion +18 vs. the lowest PD in the group of targets
(1d3 nearby or faraway enemies in a group)</strong>—90 damage, split
evenly (rounded down) between all targets hit</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit or miss:</em> The target is dazed (easy save,
6+, ends).</p>
<p><em>Natural 16+ hit:</em> Make a <em>violent dispelling</em> attack
as a quick action against the target, if it hits it does no damage but
does dispel spells and spell-like effects.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p><em>Spell absorption:</em> Once per battle when a spell not granted
by a talent hits the bonded, it has no effect. Later in the battle as a
quick action the bonded can cast the spell that hit it, using the
original caster’s attack and damage bonuses.</p>
<p><em>Warlock’s warp:</em> When one of the bonded’s attacks misses all
targets, the bonded teleports as a free action.</p>
<p><em>Violent undoing:</em> The bonded’s <em>violent dispelling</em>
attack “dispels” all manner of useful conditions, such as a rogue having
momentum or a fighter having a higher crit range. In particular, this
higher-strength version of the attack shuts down that really irritating
effect that’s always being used by that one character.</p></td>
