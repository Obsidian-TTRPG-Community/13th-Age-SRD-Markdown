    - name: "Shadow thievery"
      desc: "The shadow thief is an extension of the shadow dragon, not really a separate entity. When it drops to 0 hp, it flees back to the shadow dragon and merges with it. When this happens, if there is at least one enemy engaged with that shadow thief, the thief chooses one enemy engaged with it. Roll a d20; on a 16+, the shadow thief steals a random magic item from the chosen enemy as it flees back to the dragon (but see stop…thief below). Stolen items are replaced with shadowy duplicates that work until the end of the battle then fade to nothingness. The items can be recovered if the dragon is slain in the same battle."
