enemy)</strong>—8 psychic damage</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit:</em> Add a new podling into the battle in a
random location.</p>
<p><em>Release the pods:</em> Once per battle when the pixie pod rolls a
natural even hit with peripheral summoning, it adds a number of podlings
into the battle equal to the escalation die instead of only one.</p>
<p><em>Immobile:</em> Although its podlings occasionally pick up and
move it around out of combat, in battle the pixie pod can’t move and is
stuck except for its teleport ability.</p>
<p><em>Lost opportunity:</em> This creature can’t make opportunity
attacks.</p>
<p><em>Lurching teleport:</em> Once per battle as a move action, the
pixie-pod can teleport to a nearby location. But its control sucks. The
teleport goes in a random direction. Roll it using a d8 for
direction.</p>
<p><em>Magical concealment:</em> As long as one or more of its podlings
are nearby, the pixie pod is invisible and extremely difficult to even
detect. A PC who wants to locate the pixie-pod must spend a standard
action searching and succeed at a DC 25 skill check using Wisdom.
Backgrounds connected to plants and the wilderness help normally, and
general searching skills and magic talents might help a bit but not at
full strength. Once located, the plant can be attacked like a normal
invisible creature. When it teleports, however, it must be located all
over again.</p>
<p><em>Start with mooks:</em> The pixie pod is normally accompanied by
five active podlings that don’t count toward the total when building a
battle with the pod. Additional podlings do count, however.</p></td>
