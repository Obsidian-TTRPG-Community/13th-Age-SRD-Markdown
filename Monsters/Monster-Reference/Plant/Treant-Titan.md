<p><strong>Grasping branches +15 vs. AC (2 attacks)</strong>—30 damage,
and the treant grabs the target. When the treant starts its turn
grabbing an enemy, it can make a <em>twist and snap</em> attack against
that target as a standard action that turn.</p>
<p><em>[Special trigger]</em> <strong>Twist and snap +19 (includes +4
grab bonus) vs. PD</strong>—80 damage, and the target is dazed (save
ends). If the treant starts its turn grabbing a dazed enemy, it can make
a <em>titanic rend</em> attack against that target as a standard action
that turn.</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> 40 damage.</p>
<p><em>[Special trigger]</em> <strong>Titanic rend +19 (includes +4 grab
bonus) vs. PD</strong>—160 damage, and the treant titan can continue
making <em>titanic rend</em> attacks against the target until it escapes
the grab, at which point the treant will have to use a <em>grasping
branches</em> attack against it again.</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> 60 damage.</p>
<p><em>Fire fire fire!:</em> When the treant takes 35 or more fire
damage from a single attack, it releases all grabbed creatures.</p>
<p><em>Hardwood resistance:</em> This creature has <em>resist damage
18+</em> to all damage except fire damage and melee weapon damage, which
damages it normally.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p><em>Coffin of living wood:</em> When the treant titan hits with a
<em>titanic rend</em> attack, the target is pulled into a hollow chamber
within the treant. While grabbed by the treant this way, the target
can’t be the target of its allies’ powers or spells.</p>
<p><em>Gauntlet of branches:</em> Countless smaller branches whip
through the air around the treant titan. When a creature engaged with
the treant misses it with an attack, that creature takes 12 damage from
the whipping branches.</p></td>
