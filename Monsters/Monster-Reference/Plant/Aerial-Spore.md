<p><strong>C: Stinging tendrils +6 vs. PD (one nearby enemy)</strong>—4
poison damage, and the target is weakened until the end of its next
turn</p>
<p><em>Puffball exploder:</em> The first time each round an aerial spore
in the battle drops to 0 hp, it explodes and 1d3 nearby non-fungus
non-construct creatures are covered in spores and begin to choke. Until
the end of the battle, when a choking creature rolls a natural 1–5 on an
attack roll, it takes damage equal to the natural roll. If a creature is
affected twice by this attack, the damage it takes on a natural 1–5
doubles; if affected three times, it triples, etc.</p>
<p><em>Spores:</em> A creature choking from <em>puffball exploder</em>
can use a standard action to wash the spores off itself and/or cough
them up, preventing further choking effects until it’s affected by
<em>puffball exploder</em> again.</p>
<p><em>Weightless:</em> The aerial spore floats upon air currents, but
it prefers to stay within 5 to 7 feet of the ground so it can use its
tendrils to keep it in place or propel it. A free-floating spore too
faraway from the ground to use its tendrils can easily be blown about
from strong winds or similar magical effects.</p></td>
