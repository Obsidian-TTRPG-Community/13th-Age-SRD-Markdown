    - name: "Hoard minions"
      desc: "The dragon’s connection to its hoard is so strong that it has some control over the souls of those it previously killed who owned the treasures. Once per round as a quick action, the hoardsong dragon can summon 1d4 hoard spirits that take form by surrounding themselves in coins, wear empty suits of armor, etc., and defend the dragon’s hoard. Roll initiative for the minions once and use that count for all additional minions."
    - name: "The call of the hoard"
      desc: "The connection of a hoardsong dragon to its hoard imparts the dragon’s magic upon the hoard. Before battle, if the PCs are able to see the hoard while the dragon speaks to them, each PC that can hear the dragon must roll a Wisdom check. On a result of 24 or less, that PC is charmed as per the charm person spell and considers the dragon a friend. On a result of 25–29, the PC is lulled by the dragon’s words and the sight of the hoard; if combat occurs, the PC will be stunned during their first round. The dragon will make a suggestion to charmed PCs to leave and bring it more treasure for its hoard (while it prepares surprises for their return). Charmed PCs won’t attack the dragon, but can make a normal save each round in battle to break the charm effect (or every day outside of combat)."
