Nastier Specials for all flowers of unlife.

*Iconic energy draining:* When a PC is associated with an icon that is also associated with the flower of unlife (e.g. undead or nature icons), and they roll a natural 1â€“5 with an attack against the flower, the attacker takes 2d6 damage and the flower heals that many hit points.
