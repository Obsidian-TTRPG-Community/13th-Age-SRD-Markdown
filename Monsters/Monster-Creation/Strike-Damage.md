## Strike Damage

Orient yourself around the average damage for a monster’s attack at any  
given level. When it comes to large (or double-strength) or huge (or  
triple-strength) monsters, you don’t have to put all their damage into  
one strike. Split damage up into smaller attacks or use conditional  
follow-up attacks.
