## Stat Adjustments

Ad hoc adjustments work fine when limited to adjustments of 1 or 2  
points. If you raise a couple scores, drop a couple others.

- **Scrapper**: Sharp but thin: attacks +1 to +3, hp –10% to –30%

- **Offensive**: Soft but strong: defenses –1 to –3, attacks +1 to +3

- **Oaf**: Tough but clumsy: AC +1 to +3, attacks –1 to –3

- **Defensive**: Tough but weak: AC +1 to +3, hp –10% to –30%

- **Lunk**: Big and squishy: hp +15% to +40%, defenses –1 to –3

- **Brittle**: Tough but thin: +1 to +3 AC, hp –10% to –30%

If you want to add a full level to a monster…

- …and you only want to boost its attack: 
	- Give the monster a +6 attack  boost.

- …and you only want to boost AC: 
	- Give the monster a +6 AC boost.

- …and you only want to increase the monster’s hit points: 
	- Double the monster’s hit points.

- …and you only want to increase the damage the monster deals: 
	- Add a second attack or ongoing damage.

- …and you only want to increase every stat: 
	- Add +1 to attack 
	- +1 to all  defenses 
	- Multiply its damage output by 1.25
	- Multiply its hit  points by 1.25.
