## Rituals

Rituals are spells cast outside of combat for various free-form magical effects. Clerics and wizards learn ritual magic by default; other spellcasters can learn it by taking the Ritual Casting feat.

### Casting a Ritual

To cast a spell as a ritual:

1. Choose the spell that will be used and expended by the ritual.

2. Tell the GM what you are trying to accomplish and gather necessary ingredients for the ritual.

3. Spend 1d4 minutes/quarter-hours/hours (as determined by the GM) preparing and casting the ritual. You can’t cast other spells during this period. A PC taking damage won’t necessarily end the ritual, but it will be ruined if a character falls unconscious or launches an attack of their own.

4. Make a skill check using one of your magical backgrounds and the ability score the GM deems appropriate. Use the standard DC targets (or a special DC set by the GM), depending on your tier and the results you’re hoping for. The higher the level of the spell consumed by the ritual, the greater the effect.

No matter the outcome, the spell is expended until your next full heal-up.

### Determining Results

Choose outcomes that are outgrowths of the spell’s normal effects. The
effects don’t have to play within the usual constraints of the magic
system, and they don’t have to be taken as a precedent for future
rituals.

Failure should fail forward.

The High Arcana talent of the wizard allows you to cast a ritual in a
matter of rounds instead of minutes, but it still needs the required
components.
