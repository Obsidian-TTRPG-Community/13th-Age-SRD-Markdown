# Running-the-Game

This section has instruction for the GM on running the game.

## Using Icon Relationships

For basic icon relationship rules, see Icon Relationships.

As a GM, use a PCs’ icon relationships three different ways: for
starting a session, for in-game dramatic events, and for discovery and
surprise.

### Rolling Relationships at the Start of a Session

All players roll their PC’s icon relationship dice at the start of each
session, and everybody sees the results. As usual, rolling a 6 with an
icon die provides an unambiguous advantage. Rolling a 5 provides a
similar advantage, but the benefit is balanced by complications and
obligations that advance the story. By the end of the session, each 6 or
5 should contribute to the story somehow, either at the GM’s or player’s
initiative.

The GM uses the results to think ahead about which icons come to the
fore this session. Players use the results to start thinking about how
their icon relationships might manifest in the story.

As GM, you bear most of the burden of improvising story elements based
on the PCs’ icon relationship results. Your players may have great
suggestions, but it’s on you to weave them together with the story
elements and battles you have already prepared…or are planning to
improvise on the spot.

#### Rolling New Story-guide Dice Mid-session

Story events and talents can create new icon relationships in the middle
of play. Allow players to roll newly acquired icon dice right away as if
they’d had them at the start of the session.

### Icon Relationship Rolls as Dramatic Events

Players roll all of their relationship dice for a particular icon when
their PCs are confronting that icon’s representatives, agents, or
minions. The GM decides when an event-based roll is called for.

Story-guide rolls should occur most every session. Event-based rolls
rise out of circumstances during play.

It’s never the player’s choice to roll icon relationship dice for
dramatic events. When new circumstances and dramatic events force or
suggest interactions or confrontations with forces or situations
associated with a particular icon, the GM can call for an icon
relationship roll as a shorthand guide to the dramatic results of the
situation.

#### Rolling a 5 with Icon Events

Getting a 5 on an icon relationship check moves the story forward, just
like a 6 does, but it also generates a complication. A 5 means both good
and bad results. The negative result might be secret, it might be
delayed, and it might be nothing more than a promise until you figure
out what it really means.

### Discovery & Surprise

At the GM’s option, players may roll icon relationship dice to find out
which icons are involved in a plot element, if any. When the characters
have slalomed onto paths and adventures you did not anticipate, icon
relationship rolls can serve as an idea generator with mechanics that
everyone already understands.

Discovery dice aren’t interpreted as positively as other icon
relationship rolls. You’re using the icon dice more to determine whether
an icon has a stake in what’s involved, not necessarily whether the
situation is going to work to a PC’s advantage.

You’ll probably use this style of roll most often when the characters
have gone off your map, chasing enemies you hadn’t anticipated, seeking
treasures you referred to earlier without having a clear idea about, and
taking forest paths you hadn’t been aware existed. GMs who enjoy being
surprised by new developments may opt for discovery rolls before
improvising the consequences of the PCs’ unexpected steps.

Using icon relationship rolls from one or more characters keeps the new
developments relevant to the players and possibly relevant to the
overarching plot.

## Environments

Any place in the game world that a player might want to make a skill
check is an environment, of which there are three tiers: adventurer,
champion, and epic.

Adventurer environments are for level 1-3 characters: city streets,
wilderness areas, shallow dungeons, regular old ruins, and that sort of
thing.

Champion environments are for level 4-6 characters: deeper dungeons,
danker swamps, guarded gates of the big cities, and those sorts of
places.

Epic environments are for level 7+ characters. They are typically
related to icons, unique villains, deep underworld locations, the most
forbidding peaks, the upper reaches of the world, and so on.

The GM determines the environs where the adventure takes place.

### Environment Chart by Level

| Level | Type of Environment              |
|-------|----------------------------------|
| 1–3   | Always adventurer                |
| 4     | Mostly adventurer, some champion |
| 5     | Half adventurer, half champion   |
| 6     | Mostly champion, some adventurer |
| 7     | Mostly champion, some epic       |
| 8     | Half champion, half epic         |
| 9     | Mostly epic, some champion       |
| 10    | Always epic                      |

### Environment DCs for Skill Checks

The environment the PCs are in determines the DC of skill checks and
other challenges they may face.

#### Adventurer-tier Skill Check DCs

| Task                   | DC    |
|------------------------|-------|
| Normal task            | DC 15 |
| Hard task              | DC 20 |
| Ridiculously hard task | DC 25 |

#### Champion-tier Skill Check DCs

| Task                   | DC    |
|------------------------|-------|
| Normal task            | DC 20 |
| Hard task              | DC 25 |
| Ridiculously hard task | DC 30 |

#### Epic-tier Skill Check DCs

| Task                   | DC    |
|------------------------|-------|
| Normal task            | DC 25 |
| Hard task              | DC 30 |
| Ridiculously hard task | DC 35 |

### Impromptu Damage

When you need to determine how much damage some effect deals, use the
chart below, basing the damage on two things: the environment, and
whether the damage affects one character or many.

### Traps & Obstacles

As shown in the chart below, attack rolls for traps and other features
of the environment follow the same mathematical model as DCs for skill
checks.

Use the skill check DC on the table to give you a general guideline for
PCs attempting to disarm a trap (once they notice that there is a trap).
Failure means the trap will trigger.

### Skill Check DCs, Trap/Obstacle Attacks & Impromptu Damage by Environment

| Tier       | Degree of Challenge | Skill Check DC | Trap or Obstacle Attack Roll vs. AC/PD/MD | Impromptu Damage (Single Target) | Impromptu Damage (Multiple Targets) |
|------------|---------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Adventurer | Normal              | 15             | +5                                        | 2d6 or 3d6                       | 1d10 or 1d12                        |
| Adventurer | Hard                | 20             | +10                                       | 3d6                              | 1d12                                |
| Adventurer | Ridiculously hard   | 25             | +15                                       | 3d6 or 4d6                       | 1d12 or 2d8                         |
| Champion   | Normal              | 20             | +10                                       | 4d6 or 4d8                       | 2d10 or 2d12                        |
| Champion   | Hard                | 25             | +15                                       | 4d8                              | 2d12                                |
| Champion   | Ridiculously hard   | 30             | +20                                       | 4d8 or 2d20                      | 2d12 or 3d10                        |
| Epic       | Normal              | 25             | +15                                       | 2d20 or 3d20                     | 3d12 or 4d10                        |
| Epic       | Hard                | 30             | +20                                       | 3d20                             | 4d10                                |
| Epic       | Ridiculously hard   | 35             | +25                                       | 3d20 or 4d20                     | 4d10 or 4d12                        |


## Full Heal-ups

A party should get a full heal-up after approximately 4 regular battles,
3 hard battles, or 2 regular battles and 1 very hard battle.

For storytelling, try to sync full heal-ups with an appropriate event in
the game world.

If the PCs find some special source of healing when they don’t deserve a
full heal-up yet, allow them to get one or two recoveries back and to
make some extra recharge rolls.

If the party is able to rest and decides to heal-up ahead of time, they
suffer a campaign loss. The story moves along, but the situation in the
campaign gets noticeably worse for the party (at the GM’s discretion).
