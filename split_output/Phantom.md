<p><strong>C: Poltergeist activity +11 vs. PD (1d6 nearby or faraway
enemies in a group)</strong>—13 damage</p>
<p><em>Immaterial:</em> As a quick action the phantom can become
immaterial, phasing through solid objects, but not ending its turn
inside a solid object. Its <em>chill touch</em> attack takes a -2 attack
penalty while it is immaterial, but all its defenses gain a +2 bonus
against non-magical weapons and unarmed attacks. It is a quick action
for it to become material again.</p>
<p><em>Face of death:</em> The phantom changes its appearance to become
terrifying. All nearby and faraway enemies with less than 60 hp must
save or become affected by fear (dazed and unable to use the escalation
die) until the end of their next turn. Necromancers are immune to this
effect. (Characters with active icon relationship advantages might also
be able to dodge it, depending on the story they tell … .)</p>
<p><em>Quick use:</em> 1/battle, as a quick action.</p>
<p><em>Flight:</em> While immaterial the phantom can fly.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Special</u></p>
<p><em>Personalized terror:</em> Those affected by the <em>face of
death</em> must save to end their fear instead of it ending at the end
of their next turn.</p></td>
