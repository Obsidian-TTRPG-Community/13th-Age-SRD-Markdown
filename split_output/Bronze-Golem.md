<p><em>Natural even hit against a target in heavy armor:</em> The target
is dazed (save ends).</p>
<p><em>Natural odd hit against a target in light armor or no armor:</em>
The target takes 10 extra damage.</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> 4d6 damage.</p>
<p><em>Golem immunity:</em> Non-organic golems are immune to effects.
They can’t be dazed, weakened, confused, made vulnerable, or touched by
ongoing damage. You can damage a golem, but that’s about it.</p>
<p><em>Hidden flaw:</em> An enemy who hits the bronze golem with a
natural 18+ attack roll can roll a DC 25 skill check using Intelligence
or Wisdom to notice the bronze golem’s hidden flaw! On a success, until
the end of the battle, the golem loses its damage resistance and becomes
vulnerable to all attacks (against each enemy informed of the flaw).</p>
<p><em>Resist damage 18+:</em> When an attack targets this creature, the
attacker must roll a natural 18+ on the attack roll or it only deals
half damage.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p><em>Percussion resonance:</em> When the escalation die reaches 3+,
the bronze golem gains a bonus to its first <em>gong-like fists of
bronze</em> attack roll each turn equal to the number of attacks made
against it so far that turn. (Each turn is separate, not
cumulative.)</p>
<p><em>Spiky:</em> When an enemy engaged with the bronze golem misses it
with a melee attack, that enemy takes 2d12 damage.</p></td>
