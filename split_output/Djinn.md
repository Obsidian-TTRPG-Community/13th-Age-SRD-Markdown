<p><strong>Greatsword +13 vs. AC (2 attacks)</strong>—40 damage</p>
<p><em>Natural 5, 10, 15, 20:</em> Increase the escalation die by 1
(cumulative), and until the end of the battle, the djinn adds the
escalation die to its attacks.</p>
<p><strong>C: Assault of the whirlwind +13 vs. PD (1d4 + 1 nearby
creatures, including invisible creatures)</strong>—35 damage, and after
the attack the djinn teleports to one of the targets and engages it</p>
<p><em>Natural 5, 10, 15, 20:</em> The target is hampered until the end
of its next turn.</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> 10 damage.</p>
<p><em>Limited use:</em> The djinn can only use this attack while it’s
not staggered.</p>
<p><em>Flight:</em> Genies fly extremely well, but lumber, at best, when
walking on the ground.</p>
<p><em>Grant-a-wish:</em> A PC whose attack drops a djinn to 0 hp gains
the equivalent of an extremely favorable roll of 6 with an icon
relationship die with an icon of the PC’s choice that the PC already has
a positive or conflicted relationship with. Treat this advantage as if
it came from a positive relationship. The GM is encouraged to treat this
result with the utmost benevolence and compassion.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p>If you want a djinn to be even tougher, add a nastier special
depending on which icon or icons the djinn is presently working for. The
abilities represent the innate magic of the genie being channeled
through the influence of the icon.</p>
<p><u>Magic or Religious Icon</u></p>
<p><em>Protection boon:</em> While not staggered, the djinn gains
<em>resist spell damage 16+</em> against all spells except those cast by
a PC that has at least a one point icon relationship with the Magic or
Religious Icons.</p>
<p><u>Zealous Icon</u></p>
<p><em>Spiky bits:</em> When an enemy makes a melee attack against the
djinn and misses, it takes 2d20 damage.</p>
<p><u>Demonic Icon</u></p>
<p><em>Demonic taint:</em> The djinn gains a random demonic feature from
the Demonic Ability table.</p>
<p><u>Underground Icon</u></p>
<p><em>Unwelcome resonance:</em> Whenever a nearby enemy attempts to
trigger a magic item power, there’s a 50% chance that the power fails.
If it does, the item refuses to let its owner use that power until the
end of the battle.</p>
<p><u>Graceful or Draconic Icon</u></p>
<p><em>Sorcerous reach:</em> The djinn’s <em>assault of the
whirlwind</em> attack can also target faraway enemies.</p>
<p><u>Leader or Undead Icon</u></p>
<p><em>Aura of command:</em> Twice per battle as a free action, the
djinn can turn an ally’s normal save into an easy save (6+), or an
enemy’s normal save into a hard save (16+).</p>
<p><u>Nature or Trickster Icon</u></p>
<p><em>Wind/Shadow form:</em> While not staggered, the djinn has
<em>resist melee damage 16+</em>.</p>
<p><u>Brute Icon</u></p>
<p><em>Frenzied:</em> The djinn takes a –1 penalty to all defenses.
