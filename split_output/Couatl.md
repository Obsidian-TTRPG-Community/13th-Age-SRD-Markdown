<p><strong>Rippling scales +13 vs. PD (each enemy engaged with
it)</strong>—10 damage, and the couatl must pop free from the target</p>
<p><em>Quick use:</em> This attack only requires a quick action (once
per round) to use.</p>
<p><strong>Serpent strike +13 vs. AC (one dazed, confused, staggered, or
stunned enemy)</strong>—60 damage, and 20 ongoing poison damage</p>
<p><strong>R: Forked devastation +13 vs. PD (one nearby or faraway
enemy)</strong>—50 damage of the following type (couatl’s choice): fire,
holy, or lightning</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit or miss:</em> The couatl can make a <em>forked
devastation</em> attack against a different enemy as a free action.</p>
<p><em>Resist holy and poison 16+:</em> When a holy or poison attack
targets this creature, the attacker must roll a natural 16+ on the
attack roll or it only deals half damage.</p>
<p><em>Flight:</em> Couatls fly and hover so smoothly on their
multi-colored wings that other flyers get jealous.</p>
<p><em>Cyclic escalator:</em> When the escalation die is even, the
couatl adds the escalation die to its attack rolls.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p><em>Ever-rippling:</em> The couatl can use more than one <em>rippling
scales</em> attack during its turn.</p>
<p><em>Flee:</em> Once per campaign, the couatl can take a “campaign
loss” similar to the PC-oriented flee special action to escape from
certain death, along with its allies.</p>
<p><em>One or two icon-centric abilities:</em> Choose each appropriate
ability from the couatl’s Icon-centered Abilities list.</p></td>
