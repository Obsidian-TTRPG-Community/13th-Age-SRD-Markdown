<p><strong>Poisoned claws +8 vs. AC</strong>—4 damage, and 3 ongoing
poison damage</p>
<p><em>First failed save:</em> The ongoing poison damage increases by
2.</p>
<p><em>Second failed save:</em> The target is also weakened (save ends
both).</p>
<p><strong>R: Poisonous spit +8 vs. PD</strong>—8 poison damage</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit:</em> The target is partially blinded and takes
a –2 penalty to attacks and defenses until the end of its next turn.</p>
<p><em>Superior camouflage:</em> The wild stalker’s scales naturally
change to blend with its surroundings, allowing it to hide in plain
sight and making checks to detect it take a –5 penalty. When it attacks
from concealment without being seen first, the target is vulnerable to
its attack. It can regain its camouflage by moving out of direct sight
and hiding (hard DC to spot).</p>
<p><em>Resist poison 14+:</em> When a poison attack targets this
creature, the attacker must roll a natural 14+ on the attack roll or it
only deals half damage.</p></td>
