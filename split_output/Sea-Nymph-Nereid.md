<p><strong>Coral claws +10 vs. AC (2 attacks)</strong>—16 damage</p>
<p><strong>C: Rippling words +9 vs. MD (up to 2 nearby
enemies)</strong>—The target falls unconscious as it begins to slumber
(save ends; an ally next to the target can also use a standard action to
wake the target)</p>
<p><em>Limited use:</em> When the escalation die is odd.</p>
<p><em>Call of the sea:</em> Twice per battle as a quick action (once
per round), the nereid can call to a slumbering creature, and during its
next turn (while still unconscious), that creature will swim under the
water seeking the nereid. The creature must start making last gasp
saves, which replace its save against being unconscious. After the
fourth failure, it drowns.</p>
<p><em>Child of the sea:</em> The nereid can walk atop the waves and
move (and breathe) underwater without restraint. Its enemies might have
a more difficult time engaging it.</p></td>
