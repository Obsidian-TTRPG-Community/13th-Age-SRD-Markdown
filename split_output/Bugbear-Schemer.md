<p><strong>Big-ass warclub +9 vs. AC</strong>—8 damage</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit or miss:</em> Each of the bugbear schemer’s
nearby humanoid allies gains a +2 bonus to melee attacks until the start
of the schemer’s next turn.</p>
<p><em>Natural odd miss:</em> 4 damage.</p>
<p><strong>R: Ridiculously heavy crossbow +7 vs. AC (one nearby or
faraway enemy)</strong>—14 damage</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit:</em> The target takes 1d6 extra damage.</p>
<p><em>Limited use:</em> 1/battle.</p>
<p><em>[Special trigger]</em> <strong>C: Rebuke to fools +9 vs. MD (one
nearby enemy)</strong>—2d6 psychic damage</p>
<p><em>Limited use:</em> 1/round as an interrupt action, when a nearby
enemy rolls a natural 1–5 with an attack against it.</p>
<p><em>Combat reload:</em> During the bugbear schemer’s turn, if it
doesn’t engage an enemy or move, it regains a use of <em>ridiculously
heavy crossbow</em> if it’s expended as it reloads the crossbow.</p>
<p><em>Fighting withdrawal:</em> When the bugbear schemer successfully
disengages, one of the enemies engaged with it takes 1d6 damage.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p><em>Flee is a four-letter word:</em> When the bugbear schemer thinks
the battle is out of reach and it isn’t engaged, it can try to flee once
per battle. As a move action, roll a hard save. On a success, the
bugbear schemer had a bolt-hole or escape plan ready and it gets away
(though it’s probably just getting more troops).</p></td>
