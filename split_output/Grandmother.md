<p><strong>C: Ancient spell +15 vs. PD (2 attacks against nearby or
faraway enemies)</strong>—88 special damage (type determined by the
grandmother’s name)</p>
<p><em>Natural odd hit:</em> The target becomes vulnerable to the
grandmother’s type of special damage until the end of the battle.</p>
<p><em>Power of a name:</em> This creature gains different abilities
based on which name it has taken.</p>
<p><em>Fairy godmother:</em> <em>Ancient spell</em> deals force damage,
and when the grandmother scores a critical hit with the attack, the
target is weakened (save ends) and 1d4 of the grandmother’s nearby
allies heal 30 hp.</p>
<p><em>Fate:</em> <em>Ancient spell</em> now targets MD and deals
psychic damage. In addition, a target hit by <em>ancient spell</em>
can’t use the escalation die until the end of its next turn.</p>
<p><em>Grandmother-witch:</em> <em>Ancient spell</em> deals negative
energy damage, and when grandmother rolls a natural even hit with
<em>ancient spell</em> against an enemy engaged with her, she can make a
<em>pestle</em> melee attack as a free action.</p>
<p><strong>Pestle +15 vs. AC</strong>—66 damage</p>
<p><em>Bad idea:</em> When a creature attacks grandmother, it takes 1d6
× 10 damage of the grandmother’s special type on a hit, or 1d3 × 5
damage of that type on a miss.</p>
<p><em>Flight:</em> The grandmother flies somehow, either through a
magic item or by using spells that have become second nature.</p></td>
