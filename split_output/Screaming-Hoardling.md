makes a <em>howl of emptiness</em> attack as a free action.</p>
<p><strong>R: Returning axe or hammer +12 vs. AC</strong>—13 damage</p>
<p><em>Natural 1-3:</em> The <em>screaming hoardling</em> drops its
weapon and makes a <em>howl of emptiness</em> attack</p>
<p>Special use only:</p>
<p><strong>C: Howl of emptiness +12 vs. MD (each nearby
enemy)</strong>—10 psychic damage</p>
<p><em>Effect:</em> The screaming hoardling is dazed and vulnerable
until the start of its next turn as it scrambles for its ‘lost
treasure’, the weapon it just dropped.</p>
<p><em>Piecemeal armor:</em> When the screaming hoardling survives a
critical hit to AC it makes a <em>howl of emptiness</em> attack as a
free action, as a piece of its scavenged armor falls away. Knock a point
off its AC.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Special</u></p>
<p><em>Eternal greed:</em> If the screaming hoardling is reduced to zero
HP while coping with the effects of its <em>howl of emptiness</em>
attack, at the start of the next turn it rises with 36 HP, then spends a
quick action (or two) to re-equip lost items. A character can negate
this recovery-from-death by returning a lost item to the corpse with a
quick action. If a character has for some reason taken the screaming
hoardling’s fallen treasure, they will find themselves pursued by an
unkillable enemy until they give that item back.</p></td>
