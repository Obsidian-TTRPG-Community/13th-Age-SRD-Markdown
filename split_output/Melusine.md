<p><strong>Cold, wet slap +10 vs. AC (2 attacks, or 1 attack if in
humanoid form)</strong>—24 damage, or 30 damage vs. a confused
target</p>
<p><strong>R: Dread wail +12 vs. MD (1d4 nearby enemies)</strong>—40
psychic damage</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit:</em> Target is confused (save ends).</p>
<p><em>Limited use:</em> Only in her true form when no enemy is
confused.</p>
<p><em>Flight:</em> If in her true form, the melusine has limited flight
capability, which she uses to effect an escape if sufficiently close to
a convenient source of fresh water.</p>
<p><em>Invisibility:</em> The first time the melusine is staggered in
battle, she becomes invisible and attempts to extricate herself from the
fight. She remains invisible until she either attacks someone, or
performs a flashy maneuver (such as regaining her true form and flying
away).</p>
<p><em>Shapechanger:</em> As a standard action, the melusine can change
her form to that of any humanoid or fish (the latter usually only if
already in water), or turn back into her true form. A successful DC 25
skill check is required to see through the shapechange.</p></td>
