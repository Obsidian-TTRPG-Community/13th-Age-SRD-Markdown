<p><em>Natural 16+:</em> The target is vulnerable to the dybbuk’s
attacks until the end of the battle.</p>
<p><em>Natural 18+:</em> The dybbuk gains a <em>fear</em> aura against
the target (save ends) as the dybbuk warps its corpse-flesh into a
horrifying form. While engaged with the dybbuk, if the scared target has
30 hp or fewer, it’s dazed (–4 attack) and does not add the escalation
die to its attacks.</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> 3d6 damage.</p>
<p><em>Unholy aversion:</em> When an enemy makes a spell attack or magic
weapon attack against the corpse dybbuk that deals holy damage and rolls
a natural 18+, the dybbuk leaves its host body. The body drops in place
and the corpse dybbuk becomes an undamaged ethereal dybbuk (see that
entry). If the escalation die is 3+, reset the escalation die to 2.</p>
<p><em>Warp another’s flesh:</em> Once per battle as a free action, the
corpse dybbuk can grant a nearby ally a +2 bonus to attack and damage
until the end of the battle. The warped ally takes damage equal to its
level each time it uses a standard action to attack. If this ability is
expended, the dybbuk regains it when the escalation die reaches
4+.</p></td>
