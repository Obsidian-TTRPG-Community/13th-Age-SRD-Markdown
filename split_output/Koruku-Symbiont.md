<p><strong>Crashing fist or weapon +12 vs. AC</strong>—25 damage</p>
<p><em>Natural 16+ hit:</em> The target is weakened (normal save ends)
and the koruku symbiont can pop free of the target.</p>
<p><strong>Stinging tentacles +12 vs. AC (2 attacks)</strong>—15
damage</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit:</em> The target takes 8 ongoing poison damage
(normal save ends).</p>
<p><em>Natural 1-5:</em> The koruku symbiont can make an <em>acid
spew</em> attack as a quick action.</p>
<p><em>Limited use:</em> When the escalation die 2+.</p>
<p><em>[Special trigger]</em> <strong>C: Acid spew +12 vs.
PD</strong>—20 acid damage</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit:</em> The target is hampered (normal save
ends).</p>
<p><strong>C: Wrathful tsunami +12 vs. PD (1d3 nearby enemies in a
group)</strong>—28 damage</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit:</em> The target is stunned until the end of its
next turn.</p>
<p><em>Limited use:</em> 1/battle when the escalation die is 4+.</p>
<p><em>Scuttle forth:</em> When the koruku symbiont drops to 0 hit
points, it rolls a normal save (11+). If the save succeeds, place a
5<sup>th</sup> level koruku larva with 30 hit points on the battlefield
where it has detached itself from its former host. The staggered larva
maintains the initiative of its host, but any conditions placed upon the
host end. (If the save fails, the larva gets squashed along with its
host!)</p>
<p><em>It’s been fun:</em> When the koruku symbiont is nearby a
behemoth, the koruku detaches itself from its host and leaps onto the
behemoth. Once it finds a likely spot for hibernation is secrets a slime
which hardens into a cocoon. The host reverts back to its original
stats, losing all of the benefits it gained as a symbiont, but takes no
damage.</p></td>
