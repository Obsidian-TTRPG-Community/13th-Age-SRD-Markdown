<p><strong>Fist of water +8 vs. AC</strong>—17 damage, and the target
pops free from the naiad</p>
<p><strong>R: Skipped river stone +7 vs. AC</strong>—12 damage</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit or miss:</em> The attack targets another nearby
enemy unless it’s already targeted three enemies this way.</p>
<p><strong>C: Watery words +8 vs. MD (one nearby enemy)</strong>—The
target is confused (save ends; see <em>the river’s song</em> below)</p>
<p><em>The river’s song:</em> When a creature is confused from the
naiad’s <em>watery words</em> attack, it immediately moves into the
water next to the naiad as a free action to defend the naiad. The target
takes half the damage of the next attack that hits the naiad. During its
turn, it doesn’t attack, instead moving to stay next to the naiad. Each
time the target fails its save, it will again defend the naiad against
the next attack that hits it, taking half damage.</p>
<p><em>One with the river:</em> A naiad can walk on the surface of
water, making it seem shallow, and it can swim through the water and
breathe underwater with ease. Its enemies might have a more difficult
time engaging it.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Special</u></p>
<p><em>Naiad’s cleansing:</em> Each time a target confused by <em>watery
words</em> fails its save, it will forget something important. GM’s
choice or player’s suggestion!</p></td>
