<p><em>Natural even hit:</em> The target pops free from all enemies
engaged with it, is pulled into the pit with the dirt-fisher (who
engages it), and loses its next move action. Climbing out of the pit
requires a move action and a DC 20 check. If the bulette is not in its
pit, the bulette pulls the target to itself and engages it.</p>
<p><em>Hole digger:</em> A dirt-fisher can burrow incredibly quickly for
short distances, but it prefers to attack from within its pre-dug
trap-door pit. It usually has a few pits dug nearby if forced to leave
its current pit.</p>
<p><em>Into the earth:</em> The first time each round an attack hits the
dirt-fisher, it can hunker down and pull the lid on its pit shut. If it
does, it gains a +3 bonus to all defenses until the start of its next
turn, and any creature in the pit takes a –5 penalty to checks to climb
out of the pit. Force attacks and opportunity attacks don’t trigger this
ability.</p>
<p><em>Nowhere to run:</em> The dirt-fisher deals double damage against
creatures engaged with it in its pit.</p></td>
