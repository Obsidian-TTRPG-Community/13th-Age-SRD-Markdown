<p><strong>Diminutive sparkly sword +8 vs. PD</strong>—5 psychic
damage</p>
<p><em>Natural 16+:</em> The pixie warrior can make a <em>madness</em>
attack against the target as a free action.</p>
<p><strong>R: Enchanted bowshot +8 vs. PD</strong>—4 psychic damage, and
the pixie warrior can make a <em>madness</em> attack against the target
as a free action.</p>
<p><em>[Special trigger]</em> <strong>Madness +8 vs. MD</strong>—The
target is maddened until the end of the pixie’s next turn. The first
thing the creature does on its turn is use a standard action to make a
display of power that has no practical benefit. The GM chooses the
attack, spell, or other power, which should be the most powerful one the
character has, preferably a daily. The target expends the power in a
great show of prowess, aimed for display rather than effect. Wizards
cast their fireballs into the sky, monks demonstrate flawless form while
shadow-boxing, and clerics bless the very stones underfoot instead of
allies.</p>
<p>When the madness effect gets old, substitute any of the following
effects, by choice or at random:</p>
<p><em>1:</em> You love pixies and hate those who threaten them. The
target is confused until the end of the pixie’s next turn.</p>
<p><em>2:</em> Brains knocked loose. The target takes 4 psychic damage
each time it takes an action (save ends; yes that could be 3 times per
round or more).</p>
<p><em>3:</em> Reality bender. The target takes 5 ongoing psychic
damage. Each time the target fails the save, the ongoing damage
increases by 5, cumulative.</p>
<p><em>4:</em> Massive attack on the unconscious mind. The target
chooses one: either let the onslaught slam its mind (take 15 psychic
damage), or steel its mind against the onslaught (stunned until the end
of the pixie’s next turn).</p>
<p><em>5:</em> Compulsion to dance. The target takes 5 ongoing psychic
damage (no save) until it spends a standard action to dance maniacally.
Dancing ends all such ongoing damage, even if the target has been hit
multiple times with this effect.</p>
<p><em>6:</em> Pacifism. The target can’t attack until the end of the
pixie’s next turn.</p>
<p><em>Dazzling lights:</em> During battle, pixies fill the air with the
light and sound of countless flashy illusions. The effects are
disorienting enough that the PCs don’t get to add the escalation die to
their attacks.</p>
<p><em>Flight:</em> Pixies make flying look like a lot of fun.</p>
<p><em>Invisibility:</em> When an enemy attacks a pixie and misses, the
pixie turns invisible until the start of its next turn (even if it makes
opportunity attacks). A pixie can also turn invisible as a standard
action, in which case the invisibility still lasts until the start of
its next turn.</p></td>
