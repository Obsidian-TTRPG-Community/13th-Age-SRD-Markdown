<p><strong>Needling taunt +9 vs. MD</strong>—8 psychic damage, and the
target is hampered until the end of its next turn</p>
<p><em>[Special trigger]</em> <strong>Stinging tail +9 vs. PD</strong>—8
ongoing poison damage and the target is weakened (save ends both)</p>
<p><em>Limited use:</em> As a free action, when an enemy engaged with
the hell imp misses it with an attack.</p>
<p><em>Devil’s due (Mwhahahah!):</em> When you choose to add the
escalation die to an attack against a hell imp, the imp automatically
hits with its next <em>needling taunt</em> attack this battle, and the
target takes 2d6 extra psychic damage.</p>
<p><em>Flight:</em> Hell imps are capable of impressive feats of aerial
agility, but only when their lives depend on it.</p>
<p><em>Resist fire 13+:</em> When a fire attack targets this creature,
the attacker must roll a natural 13+ on the attack roll or it only deals
half damage.</p>
<p><em>Vanish:</em> Once per battle as a move action, a hell imp can
become invisible, pop free from all enemies engaged with it, move away
somewhere nearby, and then reappear.</p>
<p><em>Free-form ability—Provoke:</em> Hell imps are as capable as you
might expect at handling social situations, sneaking, noticing spies,
and the like. Their special talent is provocation. They can talk their
associates into all sorts of extreme emotions and imprudent behavior.
Likewise, they can probably goad PCs into losing their cool.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p><em>Potent venom:</em> The <em>stinging tail</em> attack deals 3
extra ongoing poison damage (11 total), but the target must succeed on
two saves (one for ongoing and one for weakened).</p></td>
