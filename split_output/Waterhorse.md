damage (no save, ends when the victim is no longer engaged with the
water horse)</p>
<p><em>Limited use:</em> Humanoid form only, but OK while hampered.</p>
<p><strong>C: A truly wild ride +13 vs. MD (one nearby
enemy)</strong>—The victim is drawn to the waterhorse in its black
charger form and happily mounts the beast (treat it as a teleport for
simplicity’s sake). Once they are astride, the waterhorse attempts to
flee into the nearest body of water, taking the rider with them. To
prevent this, the rider can attempt a DC 25 Strength-based control check
as a quick action (1d20 + level + Strength modifier + any relevant
background + escalation die). If they succeed, the rider gains control
of the creature and can either dismount or steer it to where they wish,
potentially with a view to stealing its bridle on their next turn
(requiring a successful attack roll with that specified aim). If the
rider does not attempt to steal the bridle on their next turn, they must
make another DC 25 check to remain in control. Stealing the bridle turns
the waterhorse into its humanoid form and throws the rider clear. If the
rider fails to control the creature at any point, it converts its next
standard action to a move action, using it and any other move actions it
may have to enter the water and trigger its watery grave attack 1 round
later. The rider can continue to make control checks until <em>watery
grave</em> is activated.</p>
<p><em>Limited use:</em> Beast form only, and only when the escalation
die is 3+.</p>
<p><em>[Special trigger]</em> <strong>Watery grave</strong>—Any creature
not in control of the waterhorse is dragged beneath the surface of the
lake. They no longer make control checks and instead begin to make last
gasp saves. If they accrue five failures, they drown. Their bones will
make a nice addition to the pile, as soon as the waterhorse has finished
gnawing on them.</p>
<p><em>Shapechanger:</em> As a standard action, the waterhorse can
change between its true hairy humanoid appearance and its black charger
disguise. A successful DC 25 skill check is required to see through the
shapechange. If the waterhorse loses its bridle, it cannot change shape
again until it recovers it. Blame the creature’s lack of imagination for
its limited forms.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Special</u></p>
<p><em>Not the first rodeo:</em> The DC for a truly wild ride is now DC
