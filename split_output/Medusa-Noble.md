<p><strong>Snakes and swords +17 vs. AC (3 attacks)</strong>—30 damage,

<p><em>Natural 18+:</em> The medusa can make a <em>petrifying gaze</em>
attack against the target as a free action.</p>
<p><strong>R: Lightning fork +17 vs. PD (one nearby or faraway
enemy)</strong>—80 lightning damage</p>
<p><em>Natural odd hit or miss:</em> The medusa deals 1d6 × 10 lightning
damage to all nearby enemies.</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit or miss:</em> The medusa can make a
<em>lightning fork</em> attack against a different target as a free
action; keep making <em>lightning fork</em> attacks until you run out of
targets that have taken damage from <em>lightning fork</em> or roll a
natural odd attack.</p>
<p><em>[Special trigger]</em> <strong>C: Petrifying gaze +17 vs. MD (one
enemy)</strong>—70 psychic damage, and the target must start making last
gasp saves as it turns to stone</p>
<p><em>Caught by an eye:</em> Whenever a nearby enemy attacks the medusa
noble and rolls a natural 1–5, the medusa can make a <em>petrifying
gaze</em> attack against that attacker as a free action.</p>
<p><em>Serpent wardings:</em> Thrice per battle, as a free action, the
medusa noble can force an enemy to reroll a spell attack that targeted
it. The attacker can’t use the escalation die for the reroll.</p>
<p><em>Skilled sorcerer:</em> If lightning isn’t working against her
target, the medusa noble can take a –2 attack penalty to change the
energy type of her ranged attack to fire or thunder.</p></td>
