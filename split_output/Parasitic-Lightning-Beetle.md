<p><em>Natural even hit or miss:</em> The target also takes 5 lightning
damage.</p>
<p><strong>R: Lightning zap +12 vs. PD (one nearby enemy not engaged
with a purple worm, purple larvae, or parasitic beetle)</strong>—20
lightning damage</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit or miss:</em> The target takes 5 extra lightning
damage.</p>
<p><em>Flight:</em> The beetles fly badly, usually just enough to get
back to the worm when they’ve been shaken off from their hiding spots in
its segments.</p>
<p><em>Scaredy bugs:</em> Whenever one or more parasitic lightning
beetles drop to 0 hp, roll a d6. If you roll less than or equal to the
number of beetles that were destroyed by that attack, all beetles in the
battle stop fighting, using all their actions during their next turn to
disengage and fly away.</p></td>
