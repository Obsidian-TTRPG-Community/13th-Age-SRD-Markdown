<p><strong>Jarring touch +7 vs AC</strong>—4 damage</p>
<p><em>Natural 2-5:</em> Target is hampered (save ends).</p>
<p><em>Contagious ennui:</em> Each enemy that misses an attack with a
natural odd roll this battle takes a -2 penalty to all its defenses
until they score a critical hit or the sadsack is reduced to 0 hit
points. (As usual, this ability does not stack.)</p>
<p><em>Ghostly:</em> This creature has <em>resist damage 12+</em> to all
damage except holy damage. A ghost can move through solid objects, but
can’t end its turn inside them.</p>
<p><em>Relic affinity:</em> Sadsacks are also vulnerable to the type of
weapon or attack that ended their lives. Interpret this liberally,
GM.</p>
<p><em>Flight:</em> Gravity does not influence sadsacks unless they are
staggered. When they’re staggered, they sink to the ground and stay
there.</p></td>
