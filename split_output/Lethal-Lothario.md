<p><strong>Brutal kiss +9 vs. AC</strong>—10 damage</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit:</em> Any Woven engaged with the target can
attack it as a free action.</p>
<p><strong>C: Unhealthy attraction +9 vs. MD (nearby enemy with the
fewest hit points)</strong>—10 psychic damage and the target is hampered
until the end of the battle or until it takes one turn as if it were
confused.</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> 5 ongoing psychic damage.</p>
<p><em>Give me your heart:</em> When the lothario drops an enemy to 0
hit points or lower, he will move next to that creature and attempt to
remove the target’s heart. The creature must begin making last gasp
saves as he cuts their chest open. On the fourth failure, the lothario
takes the heart and the target dies and becomes undead under his
control. If the lothario is stunned or moved away from the creature and
can’t return to it on his turn, the creature doesn’t have to make a last
gasp save that turn.</p></td>
