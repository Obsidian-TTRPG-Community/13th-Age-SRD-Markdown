<p><strong>Burning mace +17 vs. AC (1 or 2 attacks)</strong>—45 damage
and 45 fire damage, divided between the targets if two different enemies
are hit, or piled onto one target if only one target is hit.</p>
<p><strong>R: Fireball breath +17 vs. AC (1d3 nearby or faraway enemies
in a group)</strong>—60 fire damage</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> 10 fire damage.</p>
<p><em>Special:</em> The redscale flamewing can instead target 2d3
enemies in a group, but with a different miss effect:</p>
<p><em>Special miss:</em> Any ally of the flamewing engaged with the
missed target takes 20 fire damage, and the flamewing loses its ability
to fly using its <em>fiery wings</em> until the end of the battle.</p>
<p><strong>C: Fiery wings +17 vs. AC (1d3 closest nearby
enemies)</strong>—60 fire damage</p>
<p><em>Attack on the wing:</em> The flamewing can make attacks
mid-movement as it flies past without taking opportunity attacks, but at
a –2 attack penalty. It can split its <em>burning mace</em> attack
between two enemies in two locations as it flies past. As its wings are
made of fire, the flamewing might accidentally set the environment
ablaze, which might benefit one side or the other in the battle (or harm
both).</p>
<p><em>Fiery temper:</em> When the flamewing is forced to land, it rolls
3d20 for its next attack roll and takes the best result.</p>
<p><em>Flight:</em> The flamewing can fly, and fly fast—soaring on wings
of flame. However, its turning circle isn’t great and it can’t hover, so
in tight quarters it needs to land. Also, its wings are made of fire,
and overusing its <em>fireball breath</em> can cause the wings to gutter
and fade.</p>
<p><em>Resist fire 16+:</em> When a fire attack targets this creature,
the attacker must roll a natural 16+ on the attack roll or it only deals
half damage.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p><em>Healed by fire:</em> The first time each battle the flamewing is
hit by a fire attack, instead of taking the fire damage it heals that
many hit points.</p>
<p><em>Tail whip:</em> The dragonic deals 2d12 extra damage to a target
it misses with a melee attack.</p></td>

## Lammasu

*Flight:* All lammasu fly. Warrior lammasu fly with upright dignity,  
sometimes a bit slower than is wise. Fallen lammasu fly well enough to  
keep up with all but the quickest demons. Lammasu wizards and priests  
fly more gracefully than the warriors, but only because they’re less  
eager to run into things.

*Minor servitors:* When a lammasu isn’t in combat or resting in  
stone-form, it’s usually surrounded by a fawning retinue of spirit  
servants. The servants look like people from ages the world no longer  
remembers. They stick close to the lammasu, seldom or never speak, and  
in truth may be a projection of the lammasu’s spirit or will. The  
spirits are no use in combat, but they can manipulate small objects such  
as combs and scented perfumes to use upon the lammasu’s beard, hair, and  
jewelry.

*Stone rest:* Outside the overworld, lammasu who wish to rest can  
transform themselves into solid stone. A lammasu can see and hear as if  
it were still made of flesh. It can change back to flesh as a free  
action, but must wait a day before returning to stone, which is no great  
delay for lammasu guardians whose positions extend for decades or  
centuries. Considering that many sculptors carve stone lammasu to place  
in front of or within important structures, it’s deliberately difficult  
for a thief or assassin to know whether he is facing a stone statue or a  
transformed beast.

Note that this form of solid stone is different from the living stone  
form sometimes adopted by the lammasu warrior, wizard, and priest during  
battle.
