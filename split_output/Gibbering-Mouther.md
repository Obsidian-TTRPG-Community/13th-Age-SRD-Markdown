<p><strong>Tearing mouths +9 vs. AC (2 attacks)</strong>—4 damage</p>
<p><em>Natural 19+:</em> Target is grabbed.</p>
<p><strong>C: Pseudopod grasp +9 vs. PD (1 nearby enemy)</strong>—Target
is grabbed and moved into engagement with the gibbering mouther</p>
<p><em>Quick use:</em> 1/round, as a quick action</p>
<p><strong>Absorb +9 vs. PD (one grabbed enemy)</strong>—10 acid damage
and the crit range for this attack expands by 1 until the end of the
battle (down to a maximum of 16+)</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> 4 acid damage.</p>
<p><em>Crit:</em> Target must begin making last gasp saves as it is
slowly absorbed. Absorbed creatures can’t be resurrected by normal
means.</p>
<p><strong>C: Gibbering insanity +9 vs. MD (one random nearby
enemy)</strong>—Target is shocked (save ends)</p>
<p><em>Aftereffect:</em> The next time this battle that the target saves
against shocked it is an easy save (6+).</p>
<p><em>Quick use:</em> 1/round, as a quick action.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p><em>Insane terrain:</em> A gibbering mouther causes surrounding rocks
and dirt to soften. On rounds when the escalation die is odd characters
must succeed at a save (11+) when they attempt to move or their movement
ends and they become stuck (save ends).</p>
<p><em>Stone to flesh:</em> A gibbering mouther that also has the
<em>insane terrain</em> nastier special slowly turns the softening
terrain to flesh, then absorbs it. When the escalation die becomes 6,
the die flips straight back to 1 and the gibbering mouther heals up to
half its full hit points.</p></td>
