<p><strong>Twin skinning knives +8 vs. AC (2 attacks)</strong>—6

enemy)</strong>—12 damage</p>

<p><em>[Special trigger]</em> <strong>C: Pop-out and ride ‘em +10 vs. AC
(one nearby enemy)</strong>—10 damage, and 5 ongoing damage</p>
<p><em>Ridey-horsey:</em> While the target is taking ongoing damage from
this attack, the redcap is riding the target’s shoulders with its knives
in the target’s ears, and once during its turn the redcap can use a move
action to make the target move anywhere nearby that won’t directly cause
it harm (but opportunity attacks are fair game).</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> 5 damage.</p>
<p><em>Impossible teleport:</em> When the redcap scores a critical hit
OR when a PC or a player at the table says the <em>bad word</em>, the
redcap can teleport to a nearby hidden location it can see as a free
action.</p>
<p><em>Pop-out surprise:</em> When the redcap starts its turn and no
enemy can see it, it can make a <em>pop-out and ride ‘em</em> attack
that turn as a standard action.</p></td>
