<p><strong>Slam +10 vs. AC</strong>—7 damage</p>
<p><strong>C: Grasping slime tendrils +10 vs. PD (one nearby
enemy)</strong>—7 acid damage</p>
<p><em>Natural 16+:</em> The target takes 3 extra acid damage and is
stuck (hard save ends, 16+).</p>
<p><em>Acidic:</em> When a creature is engaged with the slime-skull or
stuck from its <em>grasping slime tendrils</em> attack at the start of
its turn, it takes 3 acid damage.</p>
<p><em>Slimy blastback:</em> When an enemy engaged with the slime-skull
hits it with a melee attack, the slime-skull fires a blast of acidic
slime back at that creature, which takes 1d4 acid damage.</p>
<p><em>Slow:</em> This creature is slow. It only moves when the
escalation die is odd or 6+.</p>
<p><em>Wall-crawler:</em> A slime-skull can climb on ceilings and walls
as easily as it moves on the ground.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p><em>Breeder:</em> If the slime-skull kills a creature, it takes that
creature’s head as a standard action and attempts to escape (it can
squeeze through gaps as small as the skull). The slain creature can’t be
resurrected until its skull is recovered because its spirit is now
trapped within the skull. If the PCs don’t track down the slime-skull
before their next full heal-up (or within a day), the stolen skull will
transform into another slime-skull. Attempts to resurrect the creature
become much more difficult, perhaps even impossible, at that
point.</p></td>
