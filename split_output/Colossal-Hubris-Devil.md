## Dragon, The Purple

<u>Standard Abilities</u>

Rather than repeat these for each entry the following abilities are  
standard for the Purple Dragon.

*Escalator:* The Purple Dragon adds the escalation die to their attacks.

*Shape-shifter supreme:* The Purple Dragon can choose to be in its human  
form or its dragon form. Switching forms is a move action. Though their  
dragon form is huge, their human form is regular size, and other forms  
are whatever size is appropriate to that form. By epic tier the Purple  
Dragon can conceivably take any form, but regardless of tier their  
vanity limits her to forms that feature purple and magenta (purple  
clothes and magenta hair, purple scales and magenta wing membranes,  
etc.).

*\[Adventurer and champion tier non-ally only\] Cunning escapes:* When  
the Purple Dragon drops to 0 hp or fewer (or would otherwise die) they  
are not slain, but instead escapes leaving an illusion in their place.  
When they escape it is a campaign win for the party, as though they had  
been killed, and their plans crumble. The Purple Dragon cannot return  
until the next tier (if defeated at adventurer tier they cannot return  
until champion tier, if defeated at champion tier they return at epic  
tier).

*\[Once per battle, in human form only\] “No, they’re the real Purple  
Dragon, shoot them!”:* As a quick action at the end of one of their  
turns, the Purple Dragon uses their powers of illusion and mind-control  
to make one of their attackers (usually the closest one to them) look  
and sound like them; the next attack against the Purple Dragon has a 50%  
chance of being targeted against the wrong target. Once the next attack  
is made, the illusion vanishes.

*Flight:* In their dragon form the Purple Dragon can fly. The Purple  
Dragon can also fly using magic, but prefers to not do so unless they  
need to fight a flying enemy.

*Illusionary soiree:* Each round roll a d6 (or a d4 if the fight is at a  
party or a luxurious lair), if it is equal to or less than the  
escalation die it has the following effect.

**1: Sparkling lights**—Ranged attacks against the Purple Dragon or  
their allies have a -2 penalty.

**2-3: Kaleidoscopic kinescope**—Any attacks against the Purple Dragon  
this round that are natural 1s are rerolled against the nearest ally of  
the attacker (or against the attacker themselves if there is no other  
possible target).

**4+: Illusionary terrain**—Any of the Purple Dragon’s enemies that move  
this round must roll a save, on a failure they end up in a place they  
did not intend.

<u>Nastier Specials</u>

*“You’ve got the wrong person”:* The Purple Dragon’s *“No, they’re the  
real Purple Dragon, shoot them!”* ability lingers long after the battle,  
maybe for days. This is probably deliberate magic on their part, because  
when they skip town the party member that looks and sounds like them  
will take the fall (or at least create enough confusion for them to make  
good their escape).

*\[Epic tier only\] Not dead yet:* The Purple Dragon gets one last  
*cunning escape* at epic tier, and though their plans are ruined by  
their defeat they’ll return one last time to exact their vengeance upon  
the party.
