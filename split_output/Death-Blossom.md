<p>Vulnerability: holy</p>
<p><strong>Sapping touch +11 vs. AC</strong>—16 negative energy
damage</p>
<p><em>Natural 4, 8, 12, 16, or 20:</em> The target is weakened (save
ends).</p>
<p><strong>R: Unlife ray +11 vs. PD</strong>—24 negative energy
damage</p>
<p><em>Natural odd hit:</em> The target takes 1d6 extra negative energy
damage for each unexpended recovery it has.</p>
<p><em>Natural odd miss:</em> If the target currently has less than its
maximum recoveries, it gains a recovery! Gaining a recovery is not
healing, but it can use that recovery later to heal as normal.</p>
<p><em>Red-yellow resurrection:</em> When the death blossom drops to 0
hit points, it’s destroyed until the start of its next turn. At the
start of its next turn, it returns to life as a blood rose or poison
dandelion that lacks the <em>black-gray resurgence</em> ability but is
otherwise undamaged and whole.</p></td>
