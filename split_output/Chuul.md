<p><strong>Crushing claws +11 vs. AC (2 attacks)</strong>—21 damage</p>
<p><em>Both attacks hit the same target:</em> The chuul grabs the
target.</p>
<p><strong>Crippling tentacles +11 vs. PD</strong>—The target is
weakened (save ends)</p>
<p><em>First failed save:</em> The target is hampered and weakened (save
ends both).</p>
<p><em>Second failed save:</em> The target is instead helpless (hard
save ends, 16+).</p>
<p><em>Quick use:</em> This attack only requires a quick action when
used against an enemy the chuul is grabbing.</p>
<p><em>Resist psychic 16+:</em> When a psychic attack targets this
creature, the attacker must roll a natural 16+ on the attack roll or it
only deals half damage.</p>
<p><em>Water-breathing:</em> Chuuls swim well and can breathe
underwater, though they prefer not to.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p><em>Bite it off:</em> When the chuul scores a critical hit against a
weakened or helpless foe, it bites off one of that enemy’s hands. An
adventurer with no hands might have trouble casting spells or holding
weapons. (A cleric might be able to restore the missing appendage with a
ritual.)</p>
<p><em>Fueled by hate:</em> Once per round when the chuul misses with an
attack, its next attack that battle deals 4d6 extra poison damage on a
hit.</p></td>
