<p><strong>Dire embrace +10 vs. PD</strong>—15 poison damage</p>
<p><em>Full embrace:</em> If the target is the only creature engaged
with the smoke devil, the attack deals 30 poison damage instead.</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> 7 poison damage.</p>
<p><em>Ember of hate:</em> Each time the smoke devil hits an enemy, the
embers floating in the center of its body glow more brightly. Once per
battle as a free action during its turn, the devil can make an <em>ember
burst</em> attack. It also makes this attack as an interrupt action when
it drops to 0 hp.</p>
<p><strong>Ember burst +10 vs. PD (each enemy engaged with the
devil)</strong>—The target takes 5 fire damage for each creature hit by
the smoke devil earlier in the battle (max 15 damage; remember to track
this).</p>
<p><em>Devil’s due (Formless):</em> When you choose to add the
escalation die to an attack against a smoke devil, it gains <em>resist
damage 16+</em> against the attack.</p>
<p><em>Flight:</em> Smoke devils drift and eddy as if blown by an evil
wind.</p>
<p><em>Resist fire 13+:</em> When a fire attack targets this creature,
the attacker must roll a natural 13+ on the attack roll or it only deals
half damage.</p>
<p><em>Free-form covert ability—Insinuate:</em> Smoke devils have a
preternatural ability to get to their chosen victims. Keeping the smoke
devil out is a hard, champion-tier challenge (DC 25).</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p><em>Smokey retreat:</em> A smoke devil can “take 12” on disengage
checks, taking a natural result of 12 instead of rolling (which normally
would allow it to disengage automatically from up to two
enemies).</p></td>
