<p><em>Natural 16+:</em> The target is stuck (save ends).</p>
<p><em>Natural roll is equal to or lower than the escalation die:</em>
1d3 nearby enemies hear the alarm and join the battle. The creatures
attracted by the constant screeching are (usually) level 1 mooks of a
type that would be appropriate for the skull’s location.</p>
<p><em>Immobile:</em> The skull can’t hop, jump, roll, or fly. It can’t
even move its jaw.</p>
<p><em>Lost opportunity:</em> This creature can’t make opportunity
attacks.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p><em>Allies:</em> Creatures that have been mystically “keyed” to the
skull aren’t affected by its <em>screech</em> attack.</p>
<p><em>Gem eyes:</em> The skull can sense the unseen and things from
beyond the world. A wizard using a <em>blur</em> spell, a rogue shadow
walking, and other similar abilities offer no protection from the skull
and its <em>screech</em> attack. (If the PCs come up with a plausible
tactic to bypass the skull, give the skull a normal save to detect
them.)</p>
<p><em>Move-triggered:</em> When an enemy near the skull uses a move
action to move, the skull can make a <em>screech</em> attack against
that creature as a free action that interrupts the move. The skull can
use this ability twice per round. Shadow walking, teleporting, and other
non-standard modes of movement will trigger the <em>screech</em>
attack.</p></td>
