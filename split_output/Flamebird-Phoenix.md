<p>Vulnerability: cold</p>
<p><strong>Fly-by flaming talons +8 vs. AC</strong>—16 damage, and 5
ongoing fire damage</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit or miss:</em> The phoenix may move again this
turn as a free action if it has already made a flying move on its
turn.</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> The flamebird phoenix can use a <em>flaming
screech</em> attack as a quick action, either this turn, or on its next
turn.</p>
<p><em>[Usually special trigger, but also possible as a standard
action]</em> <strong>C: Flaming screech +8 vs. PD (1d3 nearby
enemies)</strong>—5 fire damage, and 5 ongoing fire damage</p>
<p><em>Flight:</em> The flamebird phoenix can fly extremely well.</p>
<p><em>Flaming wings:</em> The flamebird phoenix deals 4 fire damage to
each enemy that ends it turn engaged with the phoenix.</p>
<p><em>Resist fire 16+:</em> When a fire attack targets this creature,
the attacker must roll a natural 16+ on the attack roll or it only deals
half damage.</p>
<p><em>Spectacular effects:</em> When the phoenix is dealt a critical
hit, it must roll an easy save (6+). If the save fails, the phoenix
drops to 0 hit points; see the <em>reborn in fire</em> ability
below!</p>
<p><em>Reborn in fire:</em> Whenever the phoenix drops to 0 hit points,
roll a d20 and add the escalation die. For each time this phoenix has
rolled its <em>reborn in fire</em> ability earlier this battle, subtract
10 from the roll. For example, a phoenix making its second <em>reborn in
fire</em> roll (because its first roll ended up being 20+!) when the
escalation die is 6 would roll the d20 and subtract 4.</p>
<p><strong>20+:</strong> The flamebird phoenix is immediately reborn,
healing to 40 hit points, and keeps fighting!</p>
<p><strong>15–19:</strong> The phoenix is reborn in fire, but vaults
into the overworld, removed from the battle. On the other hand, it’s not
done with the PCs! Add the phoenix to an upcoming battle by surprise,
adding it as an additional monster not accounted for by the usual
encounter-building calculations.</p>
<p><strong>8–14:</strong> The flamebird phoenix is reborn in fire but
wants nothing more to do with this battle. It makes the following
attack, but when the attack is over it shoots off into the overworld so
quickly that it’s a teleport effect, and does not return to the battle,
nor to the adventure.</p>
<p><strong>Conflagration of rebirth +9 vs. PD (every nearby
enemy)</strong>—10 fire damage</p>
<p><strong>7 or less:</strong> The phoenix flares back to life somewhere
nearby in a few hours, days, months, or years. Probably not relevant to
the PCs unless they or the phoenix bear a special grudge.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Special</u></p>
<p><em>Fire eater:</em> If a fire attack against the flamebird phoenix
fails to beat its resistance, then instead of taking damage the
flamebird phoenix heals that amount instead.</p></td>
