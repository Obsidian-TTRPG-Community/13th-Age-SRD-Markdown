<p><em>Natural even miss:</em> The swarm can pop free from all enemies,
and as a quick action this turn, it can move normally even if it has
already moved this turn.</p>
<p><em>Natural odd hit or miss:</em> The swarm can make a <em>sharp
claws</em> attack this turn as a quick action instead of a standard
action.</p>
<p><strong>Sharp claws +11 vs. AC</strong>—10 damage, and 5 ongoing
poison damage</p>
<p><em>Flight:</em> The swarm flies fast and is agile, but has a wide
turning circle.</p>
<p><em>Resist damage 16+:</em> When any attack targets this creature,
the attacker must roll a natural 16+ on the attack roll or it only deals
half damage.</p>
<p><em>Swarm:</em> This monster is a swarm of chuul body-parts
cooperating to attack humanoids. Even though there are thousands of
them, treat them as a single creature.</p>
<p><em>Water-breathing:</em> Chuuls swim well and can breathe
underwater, though they prefer not to.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p><em>Burrow under your skin:</em> When an attacker misses the swarm
with a melee attack, that enemy takes 10 ongoing damage.</p></td>
