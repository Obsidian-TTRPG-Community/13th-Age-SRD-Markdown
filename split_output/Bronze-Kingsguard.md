<p><strong>C: Gleaming perfection +13 vs. MD (one nearby or faraway
enemy)</strong>—The target must use its next move action to move closer
to the bronze errant</p>
<p><em>Limited use:</em> When an enemy not engaged with the bronze
kingsguard rolls a natural odd attack roll against it, the bronze
kingsguard can make a <em>gleaming perfection</em> attack against that
enemy as a free action.</p>
<p><em>Armor supremacy:</em> Engaged enemies wearing magical heavy armor
who roll an odd attack roll are vulnerable until the start of their next
turn, as they exaggeratedly act out their armor’s quirk.</p>
<p><em>Perfect immunity:</em> Bronze kingsguards are immune to effects.
They can’t be dazed, weakened, confused, made vulnerable, or touched by
ongoing damage. You can damage one, but that’s about it.</p></td>
