<p><strong>Razortoothed jaws +7 vs. AC</strong>—4 damage</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit:</em> Increase the damage by +1 for each razor
shark mook that has dropped this battle.</p>
<p><em>Natural even miss:</em> The target and the razor shark each take
1d6 damage.</p>
<p><em>Frenzy (group):</em> When two or more razor sharks in the same
mob are dropped to 0 hp by an attack, as a free action each dropped
razor shark attacks one random nearby non-razor shark creature before it
dies. That creature takes 1d8 damage.</p>
<p><em>Water breather:</em> Sharks breathe underwater and swim very
well. They’re not so good out of sea water (even if they jump), so treat
them as semi-hazardous terrain while they’re busy thrashing to death
outside the water.</p></td>
