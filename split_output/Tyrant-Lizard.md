## Treant

All treants except awakened tress have the *demolish* ability.

*Free-form ability—Demolish:* Given time, treants are capable of pulling  
apart just about anything that’s been put together. Their roots squeeze  
into spaces between paving stones, slowly pulling them up and out of  
place. Their branches can likewise worm their way into spaces in walls,  
doors, and gates, and with steady pressure they can pull down most  
human-made structures. This slow-motion destruction takes minutes for  
the simplest efforts and hours for major demolition.
