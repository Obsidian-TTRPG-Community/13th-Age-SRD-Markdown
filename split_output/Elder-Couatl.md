enemy)</strong>—90 damage of the following type (couatl’s choice): fire,
holy, or lightning</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit or miss:</em> The couatl can make a <em>forked
devastation</em> attack against a different enemy as a free action.</p>
<p><em>Cyclic salvation escalator:</em> When the escalation die is even,
the couatl adds the escalation die to its attack rolls and saves.</p>
<p><em>Flight:</em> Couatls fly and hover so smoothly on their
multi-colored wings that other flyers get jealous.</p>
<p><em>One or two icon-centric abilities:</em> Choose each appropriate
ability from the couatl’s Icon-centered Abilities list.</p>
<p><em>Resist holy and poison 16+:</em> When a holy or poison attack
targets this creature, the attacker must roll a natural 16+ on the
attack roll or it only deals half damage.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p><em>Ever-rippling:</em> The couatl can use more than one <em>rippling
scales</em> attack during its turn.</p>
<p><em>Flee:</em> Once per campaign, the couatl can take a “campaign
loss” similar to the PC-oriented flee special action to escape from
certain death, along with its allies.</p></td>

## Demon

Demons may or may not have a special demonic ability. Roll 1d10 for each  
non-mook normal-sized demon. If you roll less than or equal to the  
demon’s level, it has a random ability. Large or huge (or double- or  
triple-strength) demons automatically get one at least one random  
ability.

When a demon has an ability, roll 1d6 or 1d8 (GM’s choice) on the table  
below to determine what it is.

| d6 or d8 | Demonic Ability   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|----------|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1        | True seeing       | The demon is immune to invisibility and ignores any illusions.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 2        | Resist fire 18+   | You’ll see that the demon resists fire the first time you use fire against it.                                                                                                                                                              |
| 3        | Invisibility      | The first time the demon is staggered each battle, it becomes invisible until the end of its next turn.                                                                                                                                     |
| 4        | Resist energy 12+ | The demon's resistance to all energy types puts a damper on enemy spellcasters, but at least the resistance is only 12+.                                                                                                                    |
| 5        | Fear aura         | Enemies engaged with the demon who are below its fear hit point threshold are dazed and can’t use the escalation die. See Fear.                                                                                                             |
| 6        | Teleport          | 1d3 times per battle, as a move action, the demon can teleport anywhere it can see nearby.                                                                                                                                                  |
| 7        | Demonic speed     | The demon can take an extra action each turn while the escalation die is 4+.                                                                                                                                                                |
| 8        | Gate              | Once per battle as a standard action, if the demon is staggered, it can summon a single demon ally at least two levels below its own level. The allied demon rolls initiative and does not appear on the battlefield until its turn starts. |
