## Star-Masks

<u>Champion Tier: Star-Masks & Cultists</u>

To change things up, here are some additional nastier-special abilities  
to give to the star-mask cultists and puppets the PCs face. The  
abilities key off who the star-mask cultist was before they were taken  
by the mask.

<u>Dwarf (or maybe Half-Orc)</u>

*\[Group ability\] Stronger than stone:* Once per battle, a staggered  
dwarf heals to full health as a free action. No matter how many dwarves  
there are in the battle, only one can use this ability.

<u>Elf (or maybe Halfling)</u>

*\[Group ability\] Elf-like grace:* Once per battle, an elf can take a  
second standard action during its turn. No matter how many elves there  
are in the battle, only one can use this ability.

<u>Human (or maybe Half Orc)</u>

*\[Group ability\] Sudden cunning:* Once per battle, a human can turn  
one of its missed attacks into a hit, or a hit into a critical hit. No  
matter how many humans there are in the battle, only one can use this  
ability.

<u>Halfling or Gnome (or maybe Elf)</u>

*\[Group ability\] Quicker than that:* Once per battle, a halfling or  
gnome can turn a hit against it into a miss, or can ignore the miss  
effects of an attack against it. No matter how many halflings or gnomes  
there are in the battle, only one can use this ability.

<u>Epic Tier: Star-Mask Brains</u>

The epic tier star-mask creatures are all star-mask brains. Star mask  
brains warp the reality around them, creating odd effects that can  
surprise the unwary

<u>Star-Mask Brain Effects</u>

At the start of each round in a battle with one or more star-mask  
brains, roll a d10 to see what happens. Some effects are immediate,  
others last the entire round:

**1. Consumption.** One brain can consume any lower-level xombie,  
star-mask, or brain ally to heal back to half hit points if it’s  
staggered, or to full health if not staggered. If there are no allies  
present, 1d4 xombies or cultists show up (note, they may be too low  
level to have any effect except to be swiftly eliminated by the PCs or  
consumed in a later round).

**2. De-escalating illusion.** The star-mask brain blasts the minds of  
the adventurers with illusions—the escalation die decreases by 1 (to a  
minimum of 0).

**3. Delusions.** The star-mask brain messes with the adventurers’  
perceptions. Once this round as a free action, the brain can roll a save  
to avoid a ranged attack that hits it. If it succeeds, the attack misses  
instead. If it rolls 16+ on the save, the attack is redirected and  
automatically hits a nearby enemy other than the attacker of the brain’s  
choice.

**4. Mental empowerment.** Each star-mask brain or cultist in the battle  
gains a +2 bonus to saves and MD this round.

**5. Intrusive thoughts.** The star-mask brain is thinking hard about  
the characters—each PC takes 2d12 psychic damage.

**6. Magical flux.** When the PCs use spell attacks or other magic  
attacks, they must roll twice and use the lower result.

**7. Magical reflux.** When a PC casts a spell this round, they take  
2d20 force damage.

**8. Matter warp.** Everything shudders and twists for a moment, and  
each engaged creature pops free from engagement.

**9. Possession.** The hive mind possesses a PC, who is automatically  
confused until the end of their next turn. Each adventurer can be  
confused only once per battle from this effect.

**10. Steal the momentum.** The star-mask hive mind temporarily steals  
the escalation die; this round, so the monsters get the benefit of the  
die and the adventurers don’t.
