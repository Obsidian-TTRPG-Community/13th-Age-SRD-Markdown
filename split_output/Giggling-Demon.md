<p><em>Pinned down:</em> These demons torment with their tickling tails.
Enemies that disengage from them suffer a cumulative –1 penalty on all
checks and attacks until the end of the character’s turn (no maximum
penalty).</p>
<p><em>Weakling:</em> When building battles with this monster, it only
counts a half a normal mook.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Special</u></p>
<p><em>Invisibility:</em> Well, not invisibility pre-se, but more an
ability to hide from sight until they choose to reveal themselves.
Outside of combat giggling demons can fold themselves up into very small
spaces, slide under doors, even slip through cracks in floorboards. Of
course, you can still hear them giggling when you suffer a misfortune at
their hands.</p></td>
