<p><strong>Bite and trample +17 vs. AC</strong>—80 damage, 40 fire
damage, and the remorhaz grabs the target</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> The target and each other creature engaged with the
remorhaz takes 20 fire damage.</p>
<p><strong>R: Nova blast +16 vs. PD (1d3 nearby enemies)</strong>—100
fire damage</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> 25 fire damage.</p>
<p><em>Burrow:</em> As the standard monster ability, except the remorhaz
only needs to roll 6+ in snow and ice.</p>
<p><em>Furnace aura:</em> When a creature is engaged with the remorhaz
(or grabbed by it) at the start of its turn, it takes fire damage equal
to 10 × the escalation die.</p>
<p><em>Sluggish initiative:</em> The queen may be sluggish after eating
unsuccessful suitors, laying eggs, or moving across the ice like a
rushing avalanche. Roll 2d10 to determine her current initiative.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p><em>Bejeweled remorhaz:</em> The remorhaz has glowing “jewels” on its
armored plates. When a nearby or faraway enemy misses with an attack
against the remorhaz, that enemy chooses one: It takes 25 fire damage;
OR one piece of its non-magical equipment (something useful, GM’s
choice) melts or burns up. Adjust skill checks or stats accordingly.</p>
<p><em>Remorhaz steamer:</em> The remorhaz is melting the ice/snow all
the time and obscuring steam rises into the air. Ranged attacks against
the remorhaz take a –2 penalty, or a –4 penalty if the attacker is
faraway.</p>
<p><em>Spiney remorhaz:</em> The remorhaz is covered in red-hot spines.
When a nearby enemy rolls a natural 1–5 with an attack roll, it takes 30
fire damage unless it has somehow protected itself from the
heat.</p></td>
