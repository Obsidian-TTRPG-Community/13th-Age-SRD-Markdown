<p><em>Miss:</em> The nalfeshnee gains a +4 attack bonus until it hits.
Unlike most effects, let it stack.</p>
<p><strong>R: Accursed burst +15 vs. PD (1d3 nearby enemies)</strong>—50
cold/fire/lightning/negative energy damage (your choice), and the
nalfeshnee can make an <em>abyssal curse</em> attack as a free
action</p>
<p><em>[Special trigger]</em> <strong>Abyssal curse +15 vs. MD (each
creature hit by <em>accursed burst</em>)</strong>—The target is weakened
until the end of its next turn</p>
<p><em>Flight:</em> As the standard monster ability.</p>
<p><em>Unpredictable:</em> Nalfeshnee always have at least two random
demon abilities.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p><em>Hooked mooks:</em> Once per battle, if the nalfeshnee is
staggered, it can gate in 2d4 hooked demons as a quick action. Roll
initiative for the hooked demons; they do not appear in the battle and
take their turns until their next initiative count comes up.</p></td>
