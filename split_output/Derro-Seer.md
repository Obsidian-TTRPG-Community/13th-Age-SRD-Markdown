<p><em>Natural 16+:</em> The target is teleported to a nearby location
the seer can see. It can’t be moved directly into dangerous terrain,
over a cliff, etc.</p>
<p><em>Natural 1–5:</em> The seer is dazed until the end of its next
turn.</p>
<p><em>Not here but there:</em> As a quick action, the seer can teleport
a nearby ally it can see to any location that the seer can see.</p>
<p><em>Prophecy of death:</em> As a quick action once per turn, the seer
chooses an enemy it can see. The seer’s non-mook allies gain a +2 attack
bonus against that enemy. When an ally of the seer attacks that enemy
and staggers it or drops it to 0 hp or below, that ally heals 8 hp. The
effect lasts until the start of the seer’s next turn.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p><em>I did not see that:</em> Once per battle, as an interrupt action
when a critical hit is scored against the derro seer’s ally, the seer
can turn it into a normal hit instead.</p>
<p><em>Not how it should be:</em> The first time each turn that the seer
teleports an ally using <em>not here but there</em>, that ally heals 4
hp.</p></td>
