<p><strong>Terrible touch +7 vs. PD</strong>—4 negative energy

<p><em>Mob-based:</em> For every separate mob of lesser haunting mooks
in the battle (mobs start with at least four mooks), add a +1 bonus to
the lesser haunting’s attacks and damage.</p>
<p><em>Ghostly:</em> This creature has <em>resist damage 14+</em> to all
damage except holy damage. A ghost can move through solid objects, but
can’t end its turn inside them.</p>
<p><em>Fear-boosters:</em> While there are three or more lesser haunting
mooks in a battle, the fear abilities of their allies affect enemies
with half again as many hit points as usual. (For example, a
3<sup>rd</sup> level hungrymouth ghost normally has a fear threshold of
15 hit points. When there are three or more lesser haunting mooks in the
battle, the hungrymouth ghost’s fear threshold bumps up to 22 hit
points.)</p></td>
