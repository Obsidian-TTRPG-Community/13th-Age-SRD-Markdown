<p><em>Flight:</em> Efreet don’t fly as well or as quickly as djinn, but
they are able to get around okay.</p>
<p><em>Grant-a-wish:</em> A PC whose attack drops an efreet to 0 hp
gains the equivalent of an extremely favorable roll of 6 with an icon
relationship die with an icon of the PC’s choice that the PC already has
a positive or conflicted relationship with. Treat this advantage as if
it came from a positive relationship. The GM is encouraged to treat this
result with the utmost benevolence and compassion.</p>

the attacker must roll a natural 18+ on the attack roll or it only deals
half damage.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p>If you want an efreet to be even tougher, add a nastier special
depending on which icon or icons the efreet is presently working for.
The abilities represent the innate magic of the genie being channeled

## Ghost

<u>Abilities for Most Ghosts</u>

Most ghosts have several or all of the following abilities. Normally we  
use these sections to cover abilities possessed by all the monsters of a  
certain type, but there’s enough variation in ghost stories that we  
figure we should provide tools for you to choose from rather than try to  
force ghosts into one style of haunting.

For the record, all ghosts also have some version of the *ghostly*  
ability, but its strength varies so we’ve put it into each stat block.

*Bound hauntings:* Most ghosts are bound to an area, usually the area of  
their death. This ability won’t come up much in play, but it does make  
it seem likely that ghosts can be easier to get away from than other  
monsters. Move far enough fast enough and the ghost returns to the area  
it’s bound to. Occasionally festivals for the dead or other rituals can  
call bound ghosts from their hauntings, but those are unusual and  
temporary circumstances.

**Exceptions:** There may be ghosts that are bound to people, or events,  
or phenomena that travel. There might even be ghosts that aren’t bound  
to anything, but at that stage there are several other questions that  
surface and odd magical, iconic, or unique intervention seems likely.

*Flight:* Most ghosts fly, though some may be quite slow, seeming to  
drift or walking on air. Ghosts that fly in unusual ways will be flagged  
with their own abilities.

**Exceptions:** Not all ghosts fly. Some seem constrained to act much  
like they acted when they were alive, and flying wasn’t part of their  
life package.

*Unnatural touch:* Many ghosts can alter the temperature of their  
environment to more closely match the underworld or afterlife that  
they’ve so far evaded. Sometimes that’s icy cold, sometimes that’s  
burning hot, and sometimes it’s just kind of normal, which would go  
unnoticed unless the ghost is somewhere abnormal!

**Exceptions:** This is more of a special effect of ghost stories than  
part of a creature’s combat abilities, and you can safely ignore it  
unless you find telling moments when it adds to the game.
