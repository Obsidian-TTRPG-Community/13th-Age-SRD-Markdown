========
For dire animal abilities, see Dire Animals.

All bats have the following abilities:

- *Echolocation:* Bats rely on sound waves to sense their surroundings.  
  A bat can “see” in total darkness, and can detect creatures using  
  invisibility or visual illusions to hide.

- *Flight:* Small bats fly quickly and turn easily. Bigger bats fly more  
  awkwardly.

- *Wall-crawler:* A bat can climb on ceilings and walls as easily as it  
  moves on the ground.

### Battle Shade

Treat the battlefield effects that follow as a big nastier special.

<u>Against The Pcs</u>

Until all battle shades have been reduced to 0 hit points, select one of  
the following effects at the start of each round.

- Half-formed hands of mud and dirt reach out of the ground, grasping at  
  the legs and feet. Make the following attack against 1d3 non-flying  
  creatures.

  - **+7 vs PD**—The target is stuck until the start of their next turn.

- A literal fog of war (smoke, fog, blowing dust, etc.) covers the area.  
  Ranged attacks from non-battle shade creatures have a –4 penalty.

- Broken and shattered weapons erupt out of the ground. Choose up to  
  three characters in a group. Those players must roll a normal (11+)  
  saving throw or take 2d10 damage.

- Wild necromantic energy bursts like a geyser from the earth with a  
  scream of pain and fear from dozens of spectral throats. Target 1d3  
  characters with the following attack.

  - **+6 vs MD**—4 damage and the target is dazed until the end of their
    > next turn.

- Blood begets blood. As the characters are beaten and injured, the  
  accumulated pain and blood revitalizes the battlefield and the battle  
  shades. The first time a character becomes staggered or any time one  
  drops to 0 hit points, add a broken shade mook to the fight. Add it to  
  an existing mob if possible.

<u>Counteractions</u>

Player characters expecting to deal with battle shades can take  
precautions.

- Ritual casting certain spells like the cleric's *turn undead* or an  
  appropriate Terrain Caster spell from the druid could return the  
  battle area to normal for the duration of the battle.

  - Players may think to try this during combat instead of beforehand.
    > If they do so, they should make a normal (11+) saving throw at the  
    > beginning of each round. If they succeed, the battlefield effect  
    > is suppressed. If they fail, it activates like normal that turn.

- The obvious icon relationship advantages that could help are the  
  Religious and Undead Icons, but players may be able to justify others.  
  A six, along with a bit of a description should nullify the  
  battlefield effects. A five would nullify the effect but create some  
  other complication; for example, summoning the attention of the Undead  
  Icon’s servants!

### Briar Elf

<u>Environmental Effects</u>

Before the battle, roll a d4 to determine which environmental effect  
will show up during the fight. Then roll a d3 for the minimum escalation  
die value that triggers the effect at the start of the round and stays  
in effect the rest of the battle.

In the unlikely event that PCs have managed to find or lure briar elves  
outside the briar elf’s forested places of power, these effects probably  
wouldn’t apply.

<u>Humanoid Briar Elves</u>

**1. Snares**—Enemies who take more than two actions on their turn while  
on the ground must save (11+) or be whipped into mid-air by a snare trap  
and hung upside-down (stuck & –2 attack penalty), it is a standard  
action to free oneself or an ally. (GM: Choose how many snares you want  
set before the fight, probably the number of PCs plus or minus 1.)

**2. Pit traps**—The briar elves have created spike-lined pits disguised  
with forest-floor litter. If you roll a natural 1–5 on d20 roll you must  
save (11+) or become stuck (move action to end) and take your level × d6  
damage.

**3. Blowdarts**—More briar elves are lurking on the edge of the fight,  
just out of sight. If a PC rolls lower than the escalation die value on  
any natural d20 roll they take poison damage equal to their level.

**4. Gruesome display**—The whirl of battle has revealed some fresh  
corpses desecrated by the briar elves and impaled in the trees. Story  
consequences are best here: it can be someone the PCs cared about.

<u>Plant Briar Elves</u>

**1. Grasping grasses**—Disengage checks by non-plant creatures and  
non-briar elves take a –5 penalty.

**2. Cutting leaves**—Adventurers must save (11+) when they move or take  
damage equal to twice their level.

**3. Crushing vines**—Any adventurer who doesn’t move on their turn  
takes their level in damage.

**4. Thorny plants**—Each time an adventurer becomes staggered they also  
take damage equal to their level times the escalation die value.

<u>Undead Briar Elves</u>

**1. Whispers of the past**—PCs have a –2 penalty to MD and PD, as  
overlapping ghostly whispers cause pain and anxiety.

**2. Ghostly terrain**—On rounds when the escalation die is odd the PCs  
are stuck, unable to move due to ghost trees that suddenly block their  
paths.

**3. Spectral hands**—PCs take a –1 penalty to attack rolls, as ghostly  
thorn-pierced hands grab at them.

**4. Fearful destiny**—PCs who could normally resist fear effects cannot  
do so for the duration of this battle. PCs who cannot normally resist  
fear take a –2 penalty to their saves whenever they are affected by  
fear.

When slain it will yield 1d6 × 100 gp per adventurer in gems and
precious metals. At the GM’s say-so, knowledge of this bounty may grant
particularly mercenary characters a +1 attack bonus against the chimera
once it’s staggered.</p>
<p>Protector Icon</p>
<p><strong>(B)</strong> <em>Inferno belly:</em> When the chimera makes a
<em>fiery breath</em> attack, it can make another <em>fiery breath</em>
attack that turn as a quick action.</p>

a natural odd miss with <em>fiery breath</em>, it takes 20 fire
damage.</p>
<p>Nature Icon</p>
<p><strong>(B)</strong> <em>Wild heart:</em> The chimera is constantly
evolving and changing. When an enemy rolls a natural 1–5 on an attack
roll against it, the chimera adds the escalation die to its attack rolls
until the end of its next turn.</p>
<p><strong>(F)</strong> <em>Vulnerability, poison:</em> The crit range
of poison attacks against the chimera expands by 2.</p>
<p>Undead Icon</p>
<p><strong>(B)</strong> <em>Bone plates:</em> When an enemy rolls a
natural even miss with a melee attack against the chimera, the weapon
temporarily loses all its bonuses and powers and the wielder is weakened
(save ends both).</p>
<p><strong>(F)</strong> <em>Vulnerability, holy:</em> The crit range of
holy attacks against the chimera expands by 2.</p>
<p>Brute Icon</p>
<p><strong>(B)</strong> <em>Mighty tusks:</em> As a standard action, the
chimera can make a <em>tusk charge</em> attack. It can’t make any other
attacks the same turn.</p>
<p><strong>Tusk charge +20 vs. AC</strong>—100 damage</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Limited use:</em> Once the chimera has damaged an enemy with this
attack, it can’t use <em>tusk charge</em> again until it drops an enemy
to 0 hp or lower.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>(F)</strong> <em>Too many horns:</em> The horns and tusks of
the chimera lock together at inopportune moments. When it rolls a
natural 1–5 with an attack against multiple targets, it loses any
further attacks that turn.</p>
<p>Religious Icon</p>
<p><strong>(B)</strong> <em>Eagle wings:</em> The chimera can fly like
an eagle, swooping in and out of the battle.</p>
<p><strong>(F)</strong> <em>Vulnerability, negative energy:</em> The
crit range of negative energy attacks against the chimera expands by
2.</p>
<p>Trickster Icon</p>
<p><strong>(B)</strong> <em>Poison fangs:</em> When the chimera rolls a
natural 1–5 with an attack and misses, the target takes 20 ongoing
poison damage.</p>
<p><strong>(F)</strong> <em>Bickering heads:</em> The first time each
turn the chimera hits with an attack, it rerolls the attack and takes
the lower roll.</p>
<p>Draconic Icon</p>
<p><strong>(B)</strong> <em>Draconic sinews:</em> While not staggered,
the chimera rolls 2d20 with its melee attacks and uses the higher
roll.</p>
<p><strong>(F)</strong> <em>Too many wings:</em> Whenever the chimera
moves, it rolls an easy save (6+). On a failure, it provokes opportunity
attacks from each nearby enemy.</p></td>

### Couatl

In addition to their standard abilities, all elder couatls and some  
8<sup>th</sup> level couatls have another ability or attack—sometimes  
even two—that flows from the power of the icon or icons they are  
presently associated with. Memory keeper couatls who are associated with  
icons that no longer exist should be given whichever ability or attack  
that seems right. Alternatively, make up a new ability/attack that suits  
the former icon you’ve created.

Here are some Icon-centered abilities:

### Demon

Demons may or may not have a special demonic ability. Roll 1d10 for each  
non-mook normal-sized demon. If you roll less than or equal to the  
demon’s level, it has a random ability. Large or huge (or double- or  
triple-strength) demons automatically get one at least one random  
ability.

When a demon has an ability, roll 1d6 or 1d8 (GM’s choice) on the table  
below to determine what it is.

| d6 or d8 | Demonic Ability   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|----------|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1        | True seeing       | The demon is immune to invisibility and ignores any illusions.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 2        | Resist fire 18+   | You’ll see that the demon resists fire the first time you use fire against it.                                                                                                                                                              |
| 3        | Invisibility      | The first time the demon is staggered each battle, it becomes invisible until the end of its next turn.                                                                                                                                     |
| 4        | Resist energy 12+ | The demon's resistance to all energy types puts a damper on enemy spellcasters, but at least the resistance is only 12+.                                                                                                                    |
| 5        | Fear aura         | Enemies engaged with the demon who are below its fear hit point threshold are dazed and can’t use the escalation die. See Fear.                                                                                                             |
| 6        | Teleport          | 1d3 times per battle, as a move action, the demon can teleport anywhere it can see nearby.                                                                                                                                                  |
| 7        | Demonic speed     | The demon can take an extra action each turn while the escalation die is 4+.                                                                                                                                                                |
| 8        | Gate              | Once per battle as a standard action, if the demon is staggered, it can summon a single demon ally at least two levels below its own level. The allied demon rolls initiative and does not appear on the battlefield until its turn starts. |

create multiple images of itself that make it harder to target. The next
time an attack would hit the glabrezou, the attacker has to roll 11+
with another d20 roll: success indicates a hit; failure is a miss that
hits one of the mirror images instead, dealing no miss damage to the
glabrezou but dispelling all the images.</p>

uses mirror image, so movement or escape start registering as
alternatives.</p>

glabrezou can utter a word of power, canceling a single action just
taken by a nearby creature with fewer hit points than the
glabrezou—whether it was casting a spell, healing an ally, or whatever.
The GM can see the results of the action, such as a die roll, before
deciding whether to use the power word.</p></td>

its next attack.</p>
<p><strong>C: Liturgy of the Abyss +8 vs. MD (1d3 nearby
enemies)</strong>—12 damage</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit:</em> All nearby allies get a +1 AC bonus
(cumulative!) until the Demonic Icon priest drops to 0 hit points.</p>
<p><em>Limited use:</em> Every use of <em>liturgy of the Abyss</em>
reduces one random nearby Demonic Icon fanatic to 0 hp. If there are no
Demonic Icon fanatics nearby, the Demonic Icon priest cannot use
<em>liturgy of the Abyss</em>.</p>
<p><strong>R: Kill the soul +8 vs. MD (one nearby enemy)</strong>—10
damage. If an ally is engaged with the target, it can make a basic
attack against the target as a free action</p>
<p><em>The Demonic Icon’s mercy:</em> Once per battle as a standard
action, the Demonic Icon priest can heal a nearby ally or enemy for 40
hit points; the target also regains the use of one expended daily or
once-per-battle ability.</p>
<p>If the target of <em>the Demonic Icon’s mercy</em> is a player
character or other enemy, the target chooses whether to accept this
mercy; if not, the ability has no effect. A PC who accepts mercy and who
has a negative relationship with the Demonic Icon, it becomes
conflicted; if the relationship is conflicted, it becomes positive. If
the PC does not have an icon relationship with the Demonic Icon, the
character must shift one relationship point with another icon into a
conflicted relationship with the Demonic Icon.</p>
<p><em>Ye called in Their name, and I came hither:</em> As a standard
action, a player character in the Demonic Icon cult area (or some other
evil marsh or cursed area!) who has a 5 or 6 icon advantage with the
Demonic Icon can spend it to summon a Demonic Icon priest to their
location. The Demonic Icon priest teleports next to the summoner, and
acts on the turn immediately after the summoner’s to perform <em>the
Demonic Icon’s mercy</em> on the summoner or a nearby ally. After doing
so, it teleports away.</p>
<p><em>Limited use:</em> Once per campaign for all Demonic Icon priests
after the player characters’ first battle against a Demonic Icon priest.
And if used on a character who already has a positive relationship with
the Demonic Icon, the PC gets another such point, replacing one of their
other icon relationships.</p></td>

accept the blessing at any point this day, in this or another battle. If
the blessing is accepted, <em>the Demonic Icon’s blessing</em> affects
the target’s icon relationships the same as <em>the Demonic Icon’s

points than double your current hit points are dazed. If they could
normally use the escalation die, now they can’t.</p>
<p><em>3. Demonic speed</em>—You can take an extra standard action each
turn that the escalation die is even. You lose 2d6 hit points each time
you use the extra action.</p>
<p><em>4. Teleport 1d3 + 1 times this battle</em>—As a move action, you

<p><em>Ye called in Their name, and I came hither:</em> As a standard

### Devil

Although devils vary between campaigns, they need to retain certain key  
elements. Devils:

- Come from somewhere unearthly.

- Embody evil.

- Act through stealth, calculation, and guile.

- Covertly interfere in mortal affairs.

- Respect power and hierarchy—theirs, if no one else’s.

- Are clearly distinguishable from demons.

- Have horns.

Devils have a unique ability called *devil’s dues*. Player characters  
that attack a devil don’t automatically get to use the escalation die.  
If you want to add the escalation die to your attack, you have to decide  
before rolling the attack to give the devil its due. Each type of devil  
(except for those with the *weakling* ability) will specify what it gets  
when you give it its due. Note that an attack that targets more than one  
devil would require multiple devil’s due decisions and trade-offs.

Devils have other special abilities that can be picked randomly or  
purposely. Choose 0 to 2 abilities per devil. Some abilities may be  
conditional. For example, a devil may only get a special ability while a  
boss devil is commanding them.

Changing forms is a move action.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 3   | Devilish resilience        | The devil gains a +4 bonus to saves.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 4   | Fear                       | The devil gains fear aura. Players with fewer hit points than double the devil's current hit points are dazed. They cannot use the escalation die.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 5   | Final-gasp strike          | When the devil drops to 0 hp, it stays up until its turn, at which point it can take one last standard action before dropping. The devil will drop without getting that last action if it takes enough damage to reduce its hit points to negative 25% of its starting hp.                                                                                                                                                           |
| 6   | Humanoid form              | This rare special ability lets the heroes meet a pit fiend over dinner and not know it until too late. Changing forms is usually a move action.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 7   | Resist non-damage effects  | The devil resists the effects (but not the damage) of attacks with a natural attack roll of 12 or less. Ongoing damage isn’t affected by this ability. If the attack deals energy damage that the devil is resistant to (like fire), that damage is halved as normal. This ability is tied to a devil’s energy resistance number, so if you increase that number for a devil with this ability, the non-damage range also increases. |
| 8   | Summon other devils        | This ability is better used as a conditional feature of a particular battle than as a standard special ability. On the first round of battle, a group of devils keens eerily, and everyone knows they’re summoning something, but no one knows exactly what, or when it will show up.                                                                                                                                                |

| 10  | Unearthly toughness        | If a devil takes X damage or less, negate that damage. Bigger blows have full effect, but petty blows are beneath the devil’s notice. Set X at the devil’s level + 1. It will be immune to normal miss damage from enemies that are its level or lower. Or set X at 5% of its starting hit points to have the value scale up faster at higher levels.                                                                                |

<p><em>Free-form covert ability—Unnoticed:</em> The skin devil is
routinely able to pass through civilized areas without alerting dogs,
bouncers, city guards, or passersby. If the thing attacks, that’s when
you notice that it’s not a human but a monstrous pile of flesh. In
addition to passing unnoticed in crowds, it uses its fluid shape to
sneak through hidden places, and it doesn’t make much noise unless it
wants to. PCs looking for the devil won’t find it unless they have some
special information or advantage, and even then it’s a ridiculously hard
check (DC 25). Normally when PCs think they have the devil cornered, it
escapes through a tight exit that it had previously identified.</p></td>

<p><em>Devil’s due (Squirm):</em> When you choose to add the escalation
die to an attack against a lemure, another lemure in the mob somehow
ends up in an unwanted place in the battle, though it’s hard to say how
exactly. They don’t seem to teleport, but there are so many of the
things squirming around it just happens.</p>
<p><em>Living wave:</em> When three or more lemures engage an enemy,
they can pick it up and move it along with them as they please without
taking opportunity attacks. The enemy getting moved around pops free of
any other enemies engaged with it.</p>
<p><em>Nobody home:</em> When a lemure is targeted by an attack against
MD, it ignores any effects of the attack and only takes damage from it.
In addition, lemures fight in a straightforward way, without tactics.
They never disengage willingly, and they’re not coordinated enough to
concentrate attacks on a vulnerable target.</p>
<p><em>Resist fire 13+:</em> When a fire attack targets this creature,
the attacker must roll a natural 13+ on the attack roll or it only deals

their own, lemures use sheer numbers to press through locked doors,
climb walls, or dog pile on defenders.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p><em>Too dumb to die:</em> At the start of the lemure mob’s turn, roll
a d6 for each lemure in the mob that’s dropped this battle. For each 6,
one of them reassembles its horrid self and stumbles back into the melee
that turn (add 13 hit points to the mob’s hp total). To make sure a
downed lemure is truly dead, an attacker can spend an additional 7
damage of the total dealt to finish the job instead of carrying that
damage over to another lemure in the mob. Expending the right sort of
limited-use power, such as a daily spell, might also keep a number of
downed lemures totally dead. Once the last member of the mob drops, stop
rolling to see if lemures rise up.</p></td>

<p><em>Free-form covert ability—Slimy:</em> In any non-combat struggles

personally and through its underground network of minions. In an
indirect contest, the PCs might try to talk sense to one of the devil’s
dupes or to discern suspicious activity while staking out the devil’s
secret network. The honey devil is an expert at what it does, so use DC
25 for any such skill checks. Assume that the devil is competent at
slipping its influence through the network unnoticed. Failure might mean
that the PC has succeeded in gaining information, which in turn sends
them down a dead end or into a trap. In a direct confrontation, the
devil is likewise hard to pin down, see through, or otherwise get the
better of.</p>
<p>A slime devil seems unremarkable and innocuous, so downplay its
significance whenever describing it, especially when it has company.
When mortals actually decide to attack or capture a honey devil, it’s
probably slippery enough to escape at the last minute, maybe through a
hidden exit.</p></td>

#### Fury Devil (Erinyes)

<u>Hellbent</u>

Fury devils become hellbent against a creature for story reasons outside  
the scope of a single battle. PCs could give devils ample reason to hate  
them. Or a succession of 5s as relationship dice with icon interactions  
that involve the devils might suffice to make the fury devil hellbent.  
More often than not, it won’t be one of the PCs who is the target, but  
getting in the way of hellbent furies is a problem. They will try to  
bypass defenders, however, to concentrate on killing their target or  
targets.

Typically, a single fury devil leaves the Pit to exact retribution. If  
heroes manage to beat that erinyes back, then three new fury devils rise  
up to try to finish the mission that the first one failed at, and  
whoever killed the first erinyes is on their hit list, too. If those  
devils fail, five erinyes come next, with another hero added to their  
list. If stout-hearted heroes defeat all five fury devils, they’re safe.  
Maybe.

### Devil, Fang

Fang Devil is a singular river creature. The first time the heroes  
encounter the devil, it should be a 7<sup>th</sup> level monster. If the  
PCs slay the devil near water, you may foreshadow that the devil will be  
back as a multiplicity of 10<sup>th</sup> level river devils. In  
13<sup>th</sup> Age, threats don’t necessarily die the first time you  
deal with them. In the case of Fang Devil, it’s a localized threat  
within one river at a time at 7<sup>th</sup> level. When it becomes a  
multiplying group of 10<sup>th</sup> level creatures, it could spread  
out wherever the campaign requires it.

### Devil, Hubris

<u>Nastier Specials for all hubris devils</u>

*Friend or enemy?:* A hubris devil using NPCs to attack the heroes makes  
it tough for them to know if there are friends or allies among the  
attackers, forcing the characters to be more careful with their attacks.  
Any natural 1–5 attack roll against the devil is an automatic miss with  
no miss damage.

*Surprise!:* When the hubris devil attacks, it gains a surprise round  
unless the PCs were extremely perceptive (by making a ridiculously hard  
skill check for tier).

*Final-gasp soul snatch & escape:* When the devil drops to 0 hp, it  
appears dead until the start of its next turn, at which point it will  
attempt to steal a piece of the soul of the closest character before it  
escapes into a supernatural bolt hole. That character must roll a save.  
If they fail, they lose a chunk of their soul—see below for possible  
effects. Anyone who uses a coup de grace on the devil before its next  
turn will slay it before it can claim a chunk of a soul and escape (but  
the PCs might not be aware of this).

**Effects:** What does it mean to have a chunk of your soul stolen.  
You’re free to come up with complications that suit your campaign’s  
metaphysics or take the suggestions that follow as a starting point. Use  
one or more, as you choose.

- Magic items no longer work for the affected character, even ones  
  already attuned to them, and in a similar vein, no new items can be  
  attuned by that PC.

- The PC loses access to their highest level of spells or powers. For  
  example, a cleric who normally casts 7<sup>th</sup> level spells could  
  only cast them at 5<sup>th</sup> level.

- The PC takes a –2 penalty to saves.

- The PC must roll 2d20 for attack rolls and take the lowest result for  
  the first two rounds of each battle.

- The PC’s appearance changes in some disturbing, hollow way and they  
  take a –4 penalty to skill checks.

- PC loses one to three recoveries; not temporarily, their ability to  
  heal decreases.

- One icon relationship changes to become a sign of complications with  
  devils, not advantages.

- Devils gets some huge combat advantage against the PC.

**Restoration:** Similarly, you can choose how the missing piece of soul  
might be restored. Some examples:

- No big deal: the PC rolls a normal save each time they gain a level.  
  If the save succeeds, they get their soul back.

- The party must find and kill the escaped hubris devil. Luckily, the  
  PC’s ‘link’ to the devil means that each day the PC can roll a normal  
  save; on an 11+, they have a good idea of which direction the devil is  
  in. And hubris devils don’t move all that much.

- Instead, the party must travel to the center of the devils’ power and  
  steal back their friend’s soul shard. Or whatever it is that you think  
  their particular soul piece is gonna look like.

- The devils immediately barter the soul shard to an enemy icon, leading  
  to an entirely new set of quests and complications.

### Dragon

All dragons have two standard abilities: *escalator* and *flight*. The
escalator ability allows the dragon to add the escalation die to its
attack rolls. The flight ability allows the dragon to fly—fairly well,
and quickly in a straight line, though not as maneuverable as more agile
fliers.

Dragons have a breath attack. Unlike most close attacks that target a
number of enemies, dragon breath attacks don’t care about whether the
targets are in a group.

Young dragons are medium-sized. Adult dragons are usually large sized.
Huge-sized dragons are the exception, and have usually outgrown the
vulnerabilities of their weaker kin.

Some metallic dragons inspire debilitating awe in their enemies. The
*inspire awe* ability is similar to *fear*, but it’s not fear, so its
effect can combine with the dazed condition. Enemies at a hit point
threshold or lower take a –4 penalty to limited attacks (attacks that
aren’t basic or at-will) against the dragon—the enemy’s confidence in
their own heroism/puissance is shaken.

Each metallic dragon has an at-will breath weapon attack that uses the
natural result of the first attack roll to determine how long the dragon
must wait before it can use the breath weapon again.

| 6-10                | The dragon must wait one turn before it can use its breath weapon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 11+                 | After waiting one turn, the dragon rolls a normal save at the start of its next turn. If it succeeds, it can use its breath weapon that turn. Otherwise, it keeps rolling a save at the start of each turn until it regains its breath weapon attack. Once it uses its breath again, use the attack roll again to determine its next *breath weapon* attack. |

All dragons have distinct personalities. A few have unique features.
They are smart enough not to fight to their own death.

Dragons may have random abilities. This table is for chromatic dragons.
For GMs who are uncertain whether a medium dragon should have a random
ability, roll a d8. Otherwise, roll a d12. If the roll is less than or
equal to the dragon’s level, it gets a random ability according to the
table below. Some huge dragons have two abilities. If you want to give
the dragon a chance of having one of the abilities that has campaign
implications, add +2 to the roll.

| d8 or d12 or d12 + 2 | Dragon Ability        | Description (for Chromatic Dragons)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| 1                    | True seeing           | The dragon is immune to invisibility and ignores any illusions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 2                    | Whipping tail         | When an enemy engaged with the dragon rolls a natural 1 or 2 with an attack roll, the dragon can make an opportunity attack against that creature as a free action. The attack is set up by the dragon’s whipping tail but delivered by the dragon’s usual melee attack.                               |
| 3                    | Tough Hide            | The dragon has a +1 bonus to AC.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| 5                    | Nimble                | The dragon has a +2 bonus to PD.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 6                    | No vulnerability      | Unlike other dragons of its color, this dragon has no vulnerability. The PCs will figure that out the first time they try to use its supposed vulnerability against it.                                                                                                                                |
| 7                    | Now I’m mad!          | The first time the dragon is staggered each battle, it uses its breath weapon attack as a free action that does not count against the normal uses of its breath.                                                                                                                                       |
| 8                    | Serious threat        | Disengage checks against the dragon take a –5 penalty. When a creature fails to disengage from the dragon, it takes damage equal to double the dragon’s level.                                                                                                                                         |
| 9                    | PC-style racial power | The dragon has one of the racial powers of a player character race. The most common expressions per color are: white (halfling); black (halfling, half-orc, human, wood elf); green (dwarf, dark elf); blue (high elf, half-orc); red (half-orc, human, wood elf).                                     |
| 10                   | Raw power             | Until it is staggered, the dragon rolls 2d20 with its melee attacks and uses the higher roll.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 11                   | Damage aura           | When an enemy starts its turn engaged with the dragon, it takes damage equal to the dragon’s level (adventurer tier), double the level (champion tier), or triple the level (epic tier). The damage type is the same as the dragon’s breath weapon.                                                    |
| 12                   | More breath           | The dragon can use its intermittent breath 1d4 more times each battle. If its breath weapon isn’t intermittent (white and green dragons), the dragon gains the extra uses anyway, making it more dangerous than lesser specimens of its color.                                                         |
| 13                   | Humanoid form         | The dragon is capable of shapechanging into a humanoid form, usually of a warrior or spellcaster appropriate to its nature and usually not obviously draconic, registering as a normal humanoid. The dragon has the PC-style racial power of their humanoid form, but only while in shapechanged form. |
| 14                   | Some Unique Thing     | The dragon has an entirely unique characteristic, something akin to a player character’s one unique thing except that the dragon’s version may be relevant to combat. GM, if you don’t feel like making something up, choose an ability from the list above.                                           |

Metallic dragons also have special abilities, though they differ
slightly from the chromatic dragons’ abilities.

| 7   | Now I’m mad!          | The first time the dragon is staggered each battle, it uses its breath weapon attack as a free action that does not count against the normal uses of its breath.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 8   | Serious threat        | Disengage checks against the dragon take a –5 penalty. When a creature fails to disengage from the dragon, it takes damage equal to double the dragon’s level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 9   | PC-style racial power | The dragon has one of the racial powers of a player character race. If the dragon’s story suggests a specific power, choose that. Otherwise, use the most common expression per color: brass (gnome, halfling); bronze (dark elf, dwarf, half-orc, human); copper (dwarf, human, wood elf); silver (forgeborn, wood elf); gold (high elf, holy one, human, wood elf).                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 10  | Raw power             | Until it’s staggered, the dragon rolls 2d20 with its melee attacks and uses the higher roll.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 11  | Damage aura           | When an enemy starts its turn engaged with the dragon, it takes damage equal to the dragon’s level (adventurer tier), double the level (champion tier), or triple the level (epic tier). The damage type is the same as the dragon’s breath weapon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 12  | More breath           | The dragon gains a +5 bonus to saves to regain its breath weapon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 13  | Spellbreaker          | When the dragon hits a creature with an attack, one spell effect that creature created is negated (hard save ends, 16+). Once the creature saves, the effect returns.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 14  | Shake off             | At the start of each of its turns, the dragon can roll a save against one save ends effect on it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 15  | Free to flee          | Like the PCs, the dragon can escape at any time by giving up what amounts for it to a campaign loss. If the PCs are the ones to benefit from this, they should experience this as a major victory. But the dragon is still out there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 16  | Air supremacy         | The crit range of the dragon’s attacks against flying creatures expands by an amount equal to the escalation die.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 17  | Denial                | If a PC or other creature uses an attack against the dragon that is related to an icon that the dragon also has a relationship with, the dragon gains a +5 bonus to all defenses against that attack, and it only takes damage from the attack without suffering any of its effects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 18  | Survivor              | Each time the dragon drops to 0 hit points, it can roll a save. The first save in a battle is easy (6+), the second normal, the third and subsequent saves are hard (16+). If it succeeds, the dragon stays conscious and takes no damage from the attack or effect that would have dropped it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 19  | Humanoid form         | The dragon is capable of shapechanging into a humanoid form, usually of a warrior or spellcaster appropriate to its nature and usually not obviously draconic, registering as a normal human or elf or whatever. This ability is best used for long-term dragon characters that make it worth the GM’s time to create a double- or triple-strength humanoid monster to represent the shapechanged form. The dragon has the PC-style racial power of their humanoid form, but only while in shapechanged form. Shapechanging is a move action. |
| 20  | Some unique thing     | The dragon has an entirely unique characteristic, something akin to a player character’s one unique thing except that the dragon’s version may be relevant to combat. GM, if you don’t feel like making something up, choose an ability from the list above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

<p><em>Acidic haze:</em> The haze is magical, semi-aware, and remains
around the target until the end of the battle or until removed
magically. A spellcaster can cast a spell that targets AC or PD to
attack the haze and destroy it—the haze has 1 HP and an AC/PD of 22. The
GM is encouraged to play fast and loose with physics here: the mist can
be burned, condensed/frozen, blown away, absorbed, transmuted, etc. At
the GM’s discretion, there may be physical ways to remove the haze, but
it should require a hard DC.</p>

<p><em>All-terrain terror:</em> A catacomb dragon flies reasonably well,
powerful and fast in a straight line though it’s not as maneuverable as
more agile flyers. It can also burrow quickly and effectively due to the
acidic coating on its skin.</p>
<p><em>Corrosive contact:</em> When an enemy is engaged with the
catacomb dragon at the start of its turn, it takes 3 acid damage.</p>
<p><em>Resist acid 14+:</em> When an acid attack targets this creature,
the attacker must roll a natural 14+ on the attack roll or it only deals

<p><strong>C: Nightmare breath +12 vs. MD (1d3 nearby or faraway

living shadow (hard save ends, 16+)</p>
<p><em>Living shadow:</em> While a living shadow, the target can’t
physically interact with or gain aid from companions or aid them
(including healing, bonuses, and effects) but is otherwise “normal”.</p>
<p><em>Limited use:</em> 1/battle, but the ability recharges when the
dragon is staggered. If it hasn’t already made a <em>nightmare
breath</em> attack when it becomes staggered, the dragon makes the
attack as a free action and then the breath recharges.</p>
<p><em>Made of shadow:</em> The shadow dragon perceives the invisible,
is unaffected by the <em>blur</em> spell, and ignores illusions. Rogues
attempting to <em>shadow walk</em> near a shadow dragon end up in the
dragon’s belly (save ends). While there, they are helpless and take 2d12
damage at the start of each of their turns until they save and fall back
out of shadow.</p>
<p><em>Shadowy escalation:</em> When in poorly lit areas of shadow, the
dragon adds the escalation die to its attack rolls. Complete darkness or
bright daylight negates the ability.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p><em>Shadow illusions:</em> As a standard action, the dragon can
appear to be humanoid, usually disguising itself as an unthreatening old
man in a cloak (DC 35 to detect). Daylight will show the illusion for
what it is—an insubstantial dragon. Dragons with a <em>Book of Many
Faces</em> will have perfect humanoid disguises. Dropping the illusion
is a free action.</p>
<p><em>Shadowy phasing:</em> When the escalation die is even, natural
odd attack rolls against the dragon automatically miss. When the
escalation die is odd, natural even attack rolls against the dragon
automatically miss. Attacks that deal holy damage ignore this
ability.</p>
<p><u>On Holy Ground</u></p>
<p>While on “holy ground” such as a temple or consecrated shrine, all
hard saves against shadow dragon effects become normal saves. As a
standard action, a cleric who invokes the gods can produce a similar
anti-shadow effect in the nearby area until the start of their next
turn, or they can turn hard saves against shadow dragon abilities to
easy saves if that area is already on holy ground. Shadow dragons try to
avoid holy ground, and shadow thieves can only enter it while possessing
victims and will flee once the possession ends. It’s up to the GM what
counts as “holy ground” in their game.</p></td>

action (but see <em>group ability</em>).</p>
<p><em>[Group ability]</em> <strong>C: Shadow possession +13 vs. MD (one
enemy hit by <em>shadow strangulation</em>)</strong>—The shadow thief
“crawls inside” the target. The target is confused (save ends), and the
shadow thief can’t be the target of an attack or effect until it’s
forced from the target’s body when that creature saves against the
confusion effect.</p>
<p><em>Group ability:</em> For every four shadow thieves in the battle
(round up), one of them can use <em>shadow possession</em> during the
battle.</p>
<p><em>Shadow thievery:</em> The shadow thief is an extension of the
shadow dragon, not really a separate entity. When it drops to 0 hp, it
flees back to the shadow dragon and merges with it. When this happens,
if there is at least one enemy engaged with that shadow thief, the thief
chooses one enemy engaged with it. Roll a d20; on a 16+, the shadow
thief steals a random magic item from the chosen enemy as it flees back
to the dragon (but see <em>stop…thief</em> below). Stolen items are
replaced with shadowy duplicates that work until the end of the battle
then fade to nothingness. The items can be recovered if the dragon is
slain in the same battle.</p>
<p><em>Stop…thief!</em> When a shadow thief steals an item, the creature
it steals from can choose to prevent the theft, but at a cost. If the
natural d20 thievery roll was odd, the target of the thievery attempt
can choose to keep the item but become hampered (save ends) as they
wrestle with the shadow. If the natural thievery roll was even, the
target has the same choice, but it’s a hard save (16+) to end the
hampered effect.</p></td>

<p><em>Swarming motes:</em> Each time the dragon uses this attack, a

swirl around the targets. The swarm harasses each targeted enemy, hit or
miss. During its next turn, any enemy being swarmed this way must choose
one: Take 25 damage; OR roll twice for each attack roll it makes that
turn, taking the lower result.</p>
<p><em>[Special trigger]</em> <strong>C: Crying heavens +13 vs. MD (each

<p><em>Miss:</em> 10 ongoing damage.</p>
<p><em>Temporal manastorm:</em> The empyrean dragon’s connection to the
overworld falters, creating a storm of distorted time and magic in the
area. The dragon’s critical hit range for all attacks expands by 2 until
the end of the battle. In addition, when a target saves against the
ongoing damage from this attack, the crit range of its attacks against
the dragon expands by 1 until the end of the battle.</p>
<p><em>Limited use:</em> 1/battle, as a free action when first
staggered.</p>
<p><em>Three heads are better than one:</em> The empyrean dragon can
make two <em>gleaming bite</em> attacks as a single standard action, one
each from two heads. The third head is assumed to be maneuvering the
body around. It can choose not to make one of those attacks to end any
condition affecting it except for ongoing damage (this includes the
stunned condition, even though it technically doesn’t get an action when
stunned).</p>
<p>An enemy who scores a critical hit against an empyrean dragon can
forego the extra damage to lop off one of the dragon’s heads. If an
enemy deals 150 damage with a single attack against the dragon, the
attack will also remove a head. An empyrean dragon with two remaining
heads can make only one <em>gleaming bite</em> attack as a standard
action and can’t sacrifice that attack to remove conditions. The dragon

<p><em>Known to an ounce:</em> The dragon knows where every treasure in
its hoard is located, allowing it to detect any movement or shifting of
the coins and valuables. While in its lair with its hoard, the hoardsong
dragon is immune to invisibility and ignores illusions, and creatures
attempting to hide from it take a –5 penalty to their checks.</p>

<p><em>Hoard minions:</em> The dragon’s connection to its hoard is so
strong that it has some control over the souls of those it previously
killed who owned the treasures. Once per round as a quick action, the
hoardsong dragon can summon 1d4 hoard spirits that take form by
surrounding themselves in coins, wear empty suits of armor, etc., and
defend the dragon’s hoard. Roll initiative for the minions once and use
that count for all additional minions.</p>
<p><em>The call of the hoard:</em> The connection of a hoardsong dragon
to its hoard imparts the dragon’s magic upon the hoard. Before battle,
if the PCs are able to see the hoard while the dragon speaks to them,
each PC that can hear the dragon must roll a Wisdom check. On a result
of 24 or less, that PC is charmed as per the <em>charm person</em> spell
and considers the dragon a friend. On a result of 25–29, the PC is
lulled by the dragon’s words and the sight of the hoard; if combat
occurs, the PC will be stunned during their first round. The dragon will
make a suggestion to charmed PCs to leave and bring it more treasure for
its hoard (while it prepares surprises for their return). Charmed PCs
won’t attack the dragon, but can make a normal save each round in battle
to break the charm effect (or every day outside of combat).</p></td>

### Dragon, The Purple

<u>Standard Abilities</u>

Rather than repeat these for each entry the following abilities are  
standard for the Purple Dragon.

*Escalator:* The Purple Dragon adds the escalation die to their attacks.

*Shape-shifter supreme:* The Purple Dragon can choose to be in its human  
form or its dragon form. Switching forms is a move action. Though their  
dragon form is huge, their human form is regular size, and other forms  
are whatever size is appropriate to that form. By epic tier the Purple  
Dragon can conceivably take any form, but regardless of tier their  
vanity limits her to forms that feature purple and magenta (purple  
clothes and magenta hair, purple scales and magenta wing membranes,  
etc.).

*\[Adventurer and champion tier non-ally only\] Cunning escapes:* When  
the Purple Dragon drops to 0 hp or fewer (or would otherwise die) they  
are not slain, but instead escapes leaving an illusion in their place.  
When they escape it is a campaign win for the party, as though they had  
been killed, and their plans crumble. The Purple Dragon cannot return  
until the next tier (if defeated at adventurer tier they cannot return  
until champion tier, if defeated at champion tier they return at epic  
tier).

*\[Once per battle, in human form only\] “No, they’re the real Purple  
Dragon, shoot them!”:* As a quick action at the end of one of their  
turns, the Purple Dragon uses their powers of illusion and mind-control  
to make one of their attackers (usually the closest one to them) look  
and sound like them; the next attack against the Purple Dragon has a 50%  
chance of being targeted against the wrong target. Once the next attack  
is made, the illusion vanishes.

*Flight:* In their dragon form the Purple Dragon can fly. The Purple  
Dragon can also fly using magic, but prefers to not do so unless they  
need to fight a flying enemy.

*Illusionary soiree:* Each round roll a d6 (or a d4 if the fight is at a  
party or a luxurious lair), if it is equal to or less than the  
escalation die it has the following effect.

**1: Sparkling lights**—Ranged attacks against the Purple Dragon or  
their allies have a -2 penalty.

**2-3: Kaleidoscopic kinescope**—Any attacks against the Purple Dragon  
this round that are natural 1s are rerolled against the nearest ally of  
the attacker (or against the attacker themselves if there is no other  
possible target).

**4+: Illusionary terrain**—Any of the Purple Dragon’s enemies that move  
this round must roll a save, on a failure they end up in a place they  
did not intend.

<u>Nastier Specials</u>

*“You’ve got the wrong person”:* The Purple Dragon’s *“No, they’re the  
real Purple Dragon, shoot them!”* ability lingers long after the battle,  
maybe for days. This is probably deliberate magic on their part, because  
when they skip town the party member that looks and sounds like them  
will take the fall (or at least create enough confusion for them to make  
good their escape).

*\[Epic tier only\] Not dead yet:* The Purple Dragon gets one last  
*cunning escape* at epic tier, and though their plans are ruined by  
their defeat they’ll return one last time to exact their vengeance upon  
the party.

### Drow

Drow may optionally include one of these abilities as nastier specials:  
*Drow Cruelty* or *Poisons and Potions*.

<u>Drow Cruelty</u>

Choose one of the following abilities for all non-mook drow in a battle  
to have:

*Poisoner:* When the drow scores a critical hit, it can forego damage to  
force the target to start making last gasp saves. On the fourth failure,  
the target falls unconscious (and can’t be woken normally) for 2d4  
minutes.

*Take advantage of weakness:* Whenever an enemy nearby a drow rolls a  
save, it takes its level in damage.

*Umbral caul:* As long as at least one drow uses a standard action each  
round to maintain the supernatural darkness, each non-drow creature in  
the battle becomes dazed (save ends) whenever it rolls a natural 1–5  
with an attack roll.

*Venomous:* The first time each battle a drow hits with a weapon attack,  
the target also takes 5 ongoing poison damage.

<u>Poisons and Potions</u>

Drinking a potion, applying a poison, or using a substance requires only  
a quick action for a drow with one of these options. Characters who  
acquire any of these drow items must use a standard action to  
drink/apply them.

*Draft of Eschaton* (potion): When drunk it immediately purges the body  
of all poisons and toxins and ends any ongoing conditions. All the  
drinker’s saves (including last gasp saves and death saves)  
automatically succeed for the rest of the battle or for five minutes.  
Immediately after the battle, the drinker must make a DC 30 Constitution  
check or be completely debilitated and unable to travel far or to fight  
for a day.

*Dragon Apples:* Small ceramic spheres that explode. Make a basic ranged  
attack against a nearby enemy (or level + 5 for drow); on a hit, the  
target takes 10 ongoing fire damage.

*Midnight Tincture:* When this glass vial is broken, the nearby area is  
shrouded in clinging darkness. The darkness lasts 3 rounds. Each  
creature in the darkness except drow takes a –4 attack penalty. The  
tincture can be attached to an arrow or bolt.

*Potion of Spider Climbing:* For one battle or five minutes the drinker  
can climb on ceilings and walls as easily as it moves on the ground.

*Spider Venom:* A creature hit by a melee weapon coated in the venom  
takes 5 ongoing poison damage when the attack roll is a natural 16+.

*Web Dust:* Made from desiccated spiders, this dust can hold a door shut  
or stick an object to a wall for five minutes. Champion-tier creatures  
can make a DC 20 skill check to rip through something held by *web dust*  
before it fully dissolves, and epic-tier creatures can rip through such  
objects in a round. Further applications increase the effectiveness:  
three applications lasts for fifteen minutes, requires 3 successful  
checks, and takes 3 rounds for epic-tier characters to get through.

### Eidolon

As a free action each round, an eidolon can use one of the three  
following abilities, which to them are as natural as breathing is to  
mortals. (GMs, due to these special abilities, eidolons are especially  
deadly when they have allies.) When including eidolons in battles, you  
don’t need to (and probably shouldn’t!) use these abilities all the  
time; they’re better as a nasty surprise.

*Split reality:* The eidolon splits the party into different realities.  
Each player rolls a d4 for their character. That PC can only perceive  
and interact with the eidolon and with other characters who rolled the  
same number. That means PCs in different realities can’t communicate or  
affect each other in any way. For the rest of the battle, each player  
rolls a d4 at the start of the round to see which reality their  
character is now in. At the start of each round, the eidolon can choose  
which version(s) of reality its allies are in.

*Warp time:* At the start of each round two combatants swap places in  
the initiative order as determined by the eidolon. Alternately, the  
eidolon warps the momentum of the battle and the escalation die value is  
determined at the start of the round with a d6 roll.

*Reshuffle space:* The eidolon swaps the position of two creatures in  
the battle at the start of the round. Alternately, if you are using  
minis and some sort of map tiles you can rearrange the tiles with the  
minis still on them.

Finally, all eidolons have the following ability, which plays well with  
the “recurring enemy” story.

*Undying:* When an eidolon drops to 0 hp it becomes discorporate. The  
eidolon isn’t dead, just gone. It has lost its link to or focus upon the  
time and place where the adventurers are. If adventurers drive off an  
eidolon repeatedly it will probably just stay away. Eidolons can be  
vindictive and hold grudges, but they have many possible worlds to  
interact with and if a mortal proves too troublesome the eidolon will  
move on. In general eidolons need defeating on three separate occasions  
to convince them to stay away forever.

#### Iconic Eidolon

While guardian-form eidolons seem attracted to the service of the  
Religious Icon, eidolons can end up allied with any icon that serves the  
same interests as they do.

Eidolons who act in the interests of an icon have unusual weaknesses and  
strengths related to that icon, eidolons usually call icon-related  
oddities ‘iconic tests’. How much of these icon-related ‘tests’ are due  
to the eidolons being mythically linked to an icon and how much is a  
role that the eidolon is playing is left to you as the GM to decide.

Eidolons usually go out of their way to reveal any weaknesses they have  
as part of their ‘test’ of mortals.

**Magic Icon**—Wizard spells do double damage against the eidolon (crits  
do triple). Wizard spells used creatively against the eidolon have  
additional effects depending on the whim of the GM.

**Zealous Icon**—The eidolons’ attacks do double damage against those  
who have positive relationships with the Demonic Icon and sorcerers with  
the infernal heritage talent.

**Demonic Icon**—If you are willing to owe a mystically-enforced favor  
to the Demonic Icon, you can make this eidolon weakened (–4 attack and  
defenses) until the end of your turn.

**Underground Icon**—The eidolon does double damage against those using  
magical items, unless they have recently tithed to the Underground Icon.

**Graceful Icon**—The eidolon takes double damage from attacks made by  
bards, and attacks made using bows (but not from crossbows, which do  
their normal damage).

**Leader Icon**—Adventurers who fight side-by-side with each other (or  
back-to-back) gain +2 to all their defenses while doing so.

**Protector Icon**—Attacks by dragonics, breath weapons, and attacks  
from sorcerers with the metallic protector heritage talent deal double  
damage to this eidolon.

**Nature Icon**—The eidolon takes double damage from animal companions,  
and from druids in beast form. Plants near this eidolon grow more  
verdantly, flowers blooming in its presence.

**Undead Icon**—Spend a recovery to weaken (–4 attack and defense) the  
eidolon until the end of your turn. Well, we say ‘spend’ but what you  
are actually doing is sacrificing a sliver of your life-energy to the  
Undead Icon.

**Brute Icon**—If the attacker subtracts a die from their damage dice  
before rolling them, it takes double damage. The extra die of damage  
must be used to harm something or somebody relating to cities or  
civilization (instead of rolling 3d8 damage you’d roll 2d8x2 damage, and  
deal 1d8 damage to a window, book, mayor, etc.). The GM and player  
should work together to determine what a ‘die of damage’ means to  
whatever is getting smashed or slashed as part of the attack.

**Religious Icon**—If since the start of the Eidolon’s last turn, any  
adventurer has received healing from somebody who has a positive or  
conflicted relationship with the Religious Icon, then the Eidolon is  
dazed (–4 attack) until the end of its next turn.

**Trickster Icon**—Sneak attack damage dice for attacks against this  
eidolon are two die types higher (1d4 becomes 1d8, 2d6 becomes 2d10,  
etc.). Rogues can shadow walk without needing to make a roll first.

**Draconic Icon**—This eidolon takes double damage from poison,  
lightning, or fire attacks, as well as from attacks from sorcerers with  
the chromatic destroyer heritage talent deal double damage to this  
eidolon.

### Elemental Beast

<u>Making Elemental Beasts</u>

Any creature with the \[BEAST\] type can become an elemental beast, just  
follow these guidelines.

The base creature loses whatever resistances and vulnerabilities it had  
and gains those listed for its elemental affinity. It also gains between  
one and three elemental abilities for that affinity from the options  
below.

With just one ability, as well as a new vulnerability and resistance,  
creatures that become elemental beasts aren’t powerful or changed enough  
to warrant adjusting their level for purposes of creating encounters.  
However, you may want to up-level beasts with two or three abilities  
depending on those abilities and your desired level of difficulty,  
especially if you’re creating a battle with several elemental beasts.

For balance, simplicity, pacing, and playability, don’t use more than  
three abilities for an elemental beast.

<u>Powers of Air</u>

All elemental beasts with an affinity for air gain the following three  
abilities:

- *Flight:* This creature can fly.

- *Resist thunder 16+*

- *Resist lightning 16+*

All air elemental beasts have *vulnerability: force*.

In addition, choose at least one and no more than three additional  
abilities from the following list.

- *Swirling winds:* When a ranged attack targets this creature, the  
  attacker must roll 2d20 and take the lowest result.

- *D*ust devil: Make the following attack as a standard action.

  - **C: Swirling dust devil +5 + level vs. PD (1d3 nearby enemies in a  
    group)**—The target is dazed (save ends)

- *Gust front:* When this creature rolls a natural even hit with an  
  attack, it can pop free from the target of that attack.

- *Static field:* Each enemy engaged with this creature at the start of  
  its turn takes lightning damage equal to this creature’s level × 3.

- *Lightning rod:* Any attack against this creature’s nearby ally that  
  deals lightning damage instead targets this creature.

<u>Powers of Earth</u>

All elemental beasts with an affinity for earth gain the following three  
abilities.

- *Roots of earth:* When an effect would move this creature, roll a  
  save. On a success, the creature doesn’t move.

- *Resist force 16+*

- *Resist poison 16+*

All earth elemental beasts have *vulnerability: thunder*.

In addition, choose at least one and no more than three additional  
abilities from the following list.

- *Indomitable:* This creature gains a +2 bonus to MD.

- *Skin of stone:* This creature takes normal damage from critical hits.  
  In addition, once per battle as a free action, it can take only half  
  damage from an attack that hits.

- *Earthsea:* The creature gains the *burrower* trait if it does not  
  already have it.

- *Rockslide:* When this creature moves before making an attack, it  
  deals additional damage equal to twice its level on a hit.

- *Mending earth:* Once per battle as a standard action, this creature  
  can heal 15 hp or 20% of its maximum health, whichever is higher. It  
  can only use this ability while it is in contact with the ground.

<u>Powers of Fire</u>

All elemental beasts with an affinity for fire gain the following  
abilities.

- *Blazing brighter:* When this creature is targeted by fire or  
  lightning attacks, it gains a cumulative +1 bonus to attack rolls  
  until the end of the battle (max: +4)

- *Resist fire 16+*

- *Resist lightning 16+*

All fire elemental beasts have *vulnerability: cold*.

In addition, choose at least one and no more than three additional  
abilities from the following list.

- *Ashen earth:* Each enemy engaged with this creature at the start of  
  its turn takes ongoing fire damage equal to this creature’s level × 2.

- *Magma skin:* When an enemy hits this creature with a melee attack, it  
  takes damage equal to this creature’s level × 3.

- *Burning breath:* This creature can make the following attack as a  
  standard action.

  - **C: Burning breath +5 + level vs. PD (1d3 nearby enemies in a  
    group)**—d6 × level fire damage

- *Obsidian shards:* When this creature is hit with cold damage, it  
  gains temporary hit points equal to its level × 4.

- *Heat exhaustion:* When an enemy engaged with this creature heals  
  using a recovery, it gains only half the normal healing.

<u>Powers of Water</u>

All elemental beasts with an affinity for water gain the following  
abilities.

- *Fluid motion:* This creature rerolls all natural 2 attack rolls.

- *Resist cold 16+*

- *Resist acid 16+*

All water elemental beasts have *vulnerability: fire*.

abilities from the following list.

  damage equal to this creature’s level × 3.

  to roll a disengage check.

- *Blood streams freely:* While this creature is staggered, its crit  
  range expands by 2.

  environment (heavy rain, knee-deep swamp), this creature gains a +1  
  bonus to all defenses and to saving throws.

- *Splashback:* This creature gains a +2 bonus to attack rolls against  
  creatures that attacked it during the last round.

<p><strong>Barrier breaker (1 target, or adjusted targets equal to the

<p><em>Natural even hit or miss:</em> One normal structure of house or
ship size that the barrier beast is next to is destroyed.</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit:</em> 20 extra damage and the target stuck and
weakened until the start of the barrier beast’s next turn, until the
beast moves, or until it uses <em>beast surge</em>.</p>
<p><em>Natural 16+:</em> A non-druidic spell cast on the barrier beast
ends. If there are none, a non-druidic spell cast on the target
ends.</p>
<p><em>Natural 20:</em> All non-druidic spells cast on the barrier beast
or the target end.</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> 50 damage</p>
<p><em>Melee breaker:</em> The barrier beast’s <em>barrier breaker</em>
attack can target 1 engaged enemy, or engaged enemies equal to the
escalation die; or the attack can target a nearby enemy for a ‘cost’ of
two points on the escalation die. For example, if the escalation die is
6, the attack could target two engaged enemies and two nearby
enemies.</p>
<p><em>Wild Ability:</em> Each barrier beasts has one of the following
wild abilities.</p>
<p><em>Amphibious:</em> The barrier beast can swim underwater swiftly
and indefinitely.</p>
<p><em>Burrowing:</em> As amphibious, but instead of travelling
underwater the barrier beast can “swim” through the earth.</p>
<p><em>Flight:</em> The barrier beast can fly very quickly, if not very
gracefully.</p>
<p><em>Mountain Shell:</em> Twice per battle as a standard action, the
barrier beast can gain a +4 to all defenses until it makes an
attack.</p>
<p><em>Regrowth:</em> Twice per battle as a standard action, the barrier
beast can regain 100 hit points.</p>
<p><em>Beast surge:</em> Once per round when a barrier beast takes more
than 100 damage from an attack, all enemy-caused conditions affecting
the barrier beast end. Then the barrier beast rolls a normal save; if
the save succeeds, the barrier beast gets an additional free action that
depends on its <em>wild ability</em> (see below):</p>
<p>If the barrier beast has <em>amphibious, burrowing, or flight</em>,
it can choose to swim/burrow/ or fly someplace faraway without taking
opportunity attacks as a free action. At the start of its next turn, the
barrier beast gains a free move action.</p>
<p>If the barrier beasts has <em>mountain shell</em>, it uses it as a
free action that does not count against its uses of the ability.</p>
<p>If the barrier beast has <em>regrowth</em>, it can use that ability
as a free action as a free action that does not count against its uses
of the ability.</p>
<p><em>Beast resilience:</em> At-will and basic attacks do not deal miss
damage to a barrier beast, and when an attack against AC or PD targets
this creature it deals half damage unless the natural attack roll is
16+.</p>
<p>This ability does not work against attacks it is vulnerable to, and
ends when the escalation die is 6+.</p>
<p><em>Shrug:</em> The barrier beast ignores damage that’s less than
10.</p>
<p><em>If it bleeds:</em> Each barrier beast is vulnerable to one damage
type (chosen by the GM or determined randomly). When a barrier beast is
hit by an attack it is vulnerable to, it cannot use <em>beast surge</em>
until the end of its next turn.</p>
<p><em>Big enough:</em> A barrier beast is immune to opportunity attacks
from any creature that is not huge size or larger (like a barrier
beast). Normal sized enemies can disengage from a barrier beast by
rolling 6+ instead of the normal 11+.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p><em>Wilder beast:</em> The barrier beast has two (or even three!)
<em>wild abilities</em> instead of one. Choose which additional effect
is used each time beast surge is triggered.</p>
<p><em>Breath weapon:</em> When the escalation die is even the barrier
beast can make a <em>breath weapon</em> attack as a quick action once
per round, or use it as the additional effect when <em>beast surge</em>
is triggered. Pick or roll a random energy type that is different from
the vulnerability of the barrier beast. <em>Breath weapon</em> does that
type of damage</p>

the Fallen Icon, though it cannot be otherwise targeted or damaged by
the Fallen Icon (which does nothing to prevent the Fallen Icon’s allies
from piling on!). If the target attacks and hits the Fallen Icon for
more than 100 damage, their next save against the <em>wrathful
earth</em> effect is an easy one (6+).</p>
<p><strong>C: Angry Sky + 19 vs. PD (all nearby flying enemies, and a

(save ends)</p>
<p><em>Natural even miss:</em> 30 thunder damage.</p>
<p><em>Natural odd miss:</em> 15 cold damage.</p>
<p><em>Special trigger:</em> Use as a free action once per turn at the

<p><em>Ambulatory landscape:</em> When the Fallen Icon uses its first
move action each turn, each creature of less than huge size that is
engaged with or next to it before or after the movement takes 60 damage.
In addition, the Fallen Icon is immune to opportunity attacks. Enemies
of less than huge size can disengage from it with an easy save (6+).</p>
<p><em>Wildest shape:</em> At the start of its turn, the Fallen Icon can
change its creature type to beast, elemental, or plant. This ends all
conditions affecting it.</p>
<p><em>Natural resistance:</em> The Fallen Icon has <em>resist poison
16+</em>. In addition, as a beast it has <em>resist cold 16+</em>. As a
plant it has <em>resist lightning 16+</em>. As an elemental it has
<em>resist fire 16+</em>.</p>
<p><em>Earth and sea and sky:</em> The Fallen Icon can sprout wings to
clumsily fly, and can swim indefinitely at any depth.</p>
<p><em>Natural supremacy:</em> The Fallen Icon’s existence disrupts
arcane magic and divine magic (but not druidic magic): natural odd hits
by arcane and divine spells miss the Fallen Icon, while odd misses are
rerolled against an enemy engaged with the Fallen Icon. Natural 1s
target the caster.</p>
<p><em>Enemy of civilization:</em> As a move action, the Fallen Icon can
destroy one ordinary structure it can reach, such as a house, castle
wall, temple, or ship. The structure is automatically rendered useless,
and each creature inside or on the structure is subject to a
<em>collapse</em> attack</p>
<p><strong>Collapse +16 vs. PD (each creature in/on
structure)</strong>—90 damage and the target is stuck and takes 20
ongoing damage (hard save ends both, 16+)</p>
<p><em>Those that walk the forest:</em> Whenever the Fallen Icon becomes
staggered, suffers more than 120 damage from a single attack, or is
critically hit, a mob of Fallen Icon mooks will join the battle nearby
the triggering enemy. While these creatures are in play, the Fallen Icon
has a bonus to all defenses equal to the number of Fallen Icon mobs in
the battle.</p>
<p><em>Seeds on the wind:</em> If the Fallen Icon is slain, the GM
secretly rolls a normal save (11+) at the end of <em>each session</em>,
including this one. If the save succeeds, the Fallen Icon returns to
life near where it fell or in some distant wilderness. If the campaign
somehow ends while the Fallen Icon is still dead, it’s the GM’s call
whether the Fallen Icon stays dead or rises after the events of the
campaign.</p>

Third PC campaign victory: Remove the *seeds on the wind* ability.

<u>Mook Squads</u>

When *those that walk the forest* is triggered, roll 1d4+2 for the

the battle; 1–2: fanatical druid circle; 3: frenzied wolf pack; 4:

Remember that starting a battle with these mooks in play makes the

<p><strong>Hammer of golden sovereignty +18 vs. AC (up to 3

<p><em>Natural even hit:</em> The target pops free and takes extra
damage equal to the attack roll.</p>
<p><em>First natural even miss each round if targeting one or two

sovereignty</em> attack against the enemy it missed.</p>

<p><em>[Special trigger]</em> <strong>C: Golden greed +18 vs. MD (one
nearby enemy)</strong>—The target is confused (save ends)</p>
<p><em>Limited use:</em> When a nearby enemy uses the magic item power
of an epic tier item, the Fallen Icon may make a <em>golden greed</em>
attack against 1d4 other nearby enemies as a free action. (It’s possible
the PCs should have some warning, for example, a magic item might be
too-eagerly wheedling to be used. Or maybe you’d rather teach lessons
the hard way.)</p>
<p><em>The mask slips:</em> When first staggered, the Fallen Icon makes
a <em>behind the mask</em> attack against the enemy that caused the
triggering damage as a free action.</p>
<p><em>The wandering king:</em> The Fallen Icon can deal 4d6 damage to
itself and teleport someplace it can see nearby as a move action.</p>
<p><em>Sticks and rags:</em> The Fallen Icon has <em>resist damage
16+</em> to attacks not made with epic-tier magical weapons, implements,
or bracers. Enemies not wearing epic-tier magical armor are vulnerable
to its <em>hammer of golden sovereignty</em> attacks (that’s
right—eschewing magic items makes it easier to defeat the minions of the
Fallen Icon, but harder to beat the Fallen Icon itself).</p>
<p><em>Even worse:</em> When the escalation die is even, the Fallen Icon
rolls 2d20 instead of 1d20 and uses the higher result whenever it
attacks or rolls a save.</p>
<p>Fallen icon: The Fallen Icon is no longer an icon, but it still
possesses magical bonds with reality that make it difficult to destroy.
See the Campaign Impact section immediately following the Fallen Icon’s
stat block for ways in which significant campaign victories can make the
Fallen Icon easier to defeat. (To be clear: if the PCs don’t achieve any
of these campaign victories, the Fallen Icon will be difficult or
perhaps even impossible to destroy.)</p>
<p><em>Compel fealty:</em> An epic-tier dwarf, forgeborn, or human slain
by the Fallen Icon will arise at the end of the battle as a bronze
kingsguard, loyal gatherer, or royal bearer—whichever seems most
appropriate.</p>
<p><em>Eternal kingdom:</em> If the Fallen Icon King is slain, the GM
secretly rolls a normal save (11+) at the end of <em>each session</em>,
including this one. If the save succeeds, the Fallen Icon returns to
life in one of its secret treasure rooms deep in the underworld. If the
campaign somehow ends while the Fallen Icon is still dead, it’s the GM’s
call whether the Fallen Icon stays dead or rises after the events of the
campaign.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p><em>Fealty owed:</em> Human, dwarf, and forgeborn characters may not
use their racial power until the escalation die reaches 4 or higher, and
not when engaged with the Fallen Icon (so standard humans are simply out
of luck).</p>
<p><em>Fealty shown:</em> The first time each round an attack would
reduce the Fallen Icon to zero hit points or less, it instead damages
the closest nearby loyal gatherer. If these have all been destroyed, the
attack damages the closest nearby royal bearer, then finally the closest
bronze kingsguard. If these have all been destroyed, the Fallen Icon is
reduced to zero hit points—but see <em>long live the icon</em>
below.</p>
<p><em>Long Live the Icon:</em> When the Fallen Icon is finally
defeated, nothing remains but a featureless gold mask that wants to be
picked up. This mask makes a <em>golden greed</em> attack against each
enemy in the battle as a free action. The save to end the confusion from
this attack is a hard save, with confused targets violently fighting
over the mask. When no targets are confused, the mask crumbles into
dust. (If one PC slays the others while confused, they’re probably going
to put on the mask.)</p></td>

### Faun

<u>Ability for all fauns: destiny</u>

Fauns who are likely to end up in a fight choose one of two paths. The  
paths determine which of their defenses will be higher, and in some  
cases determine an additional ability or two.

*Path of the Sword:* More martial-minded, these fauns are usually  
warriors, thieves, and hunters. They have a higher Physical Defense  
(PD).

*Path of Song:* Magically-inclined, these fauns are usually bards,  
magicians, priests, or druids. They have a higher Mental Defense (MD).

### Flower of Unlife

All flowers of unlife have a nastier special available called *Iconic  
energy drain*. When a PC is associated with an icon that is also  
associated with the flower of unlife (e.g. undead or nature icons), and  
they roll a natural 1–5 with an attack against the flower, the attacker  
takes 2d6 damage and the flower heals that many hit points.

### The Fomori

<u>Unclean-One Abilities</u>

Add one or two of the following abilities to humanoids to create  
cultists who worship the true-fomori (or to beasts to create corrupted  
animals).

1.  *Ugly physique:* The cultist is repulsive almost beyond  
    comprehension, but its twisted form grants it the ability to  
    withstand blows. It gains +2 to AC and +1 to PD.

2.  *Uncanny speed:* The unclean-one gains a +1d10 bonus to its  
    initiative. It has a +2 attack bonus against enemies that started  
    the battle with lower initiative scores.

3.  *Unearthly beauty:* The cultist has a perfect and unaging physical  
    body, a counterpoint to its increasingly corrupted soul. It gains +2  
    to PD and MD.

4.  *Unhealthy vigor:* When a melee attack hits the unclean-one, sores  
    and pustules on its body burst, and the attacker takes 5 acid damage  
    (champion: 10 damage; epic 15 damage).

5.  *Unhinged joints:* The unclean-one cultist can move in strange ways,  
    crawling up walls like a giant bug, skittering along the ground, and  
    so forth. It gains a +2 bonus to disengage checks.

6.  *Unholy regeneration:* When the escalation die is odd, the  
    unclean-one heals hit points equal to its level times the escalation  
    die value at the start of its turn.

7.  *Unnatural strength:* Once per battle, when the unclean-one misses  
    with an attack (but not when it fumbles), it can change it to a hit  
    and increase the damage by 2 for every point in the difference  
    between the missed result and what it needed to hit as a free  
    action. When it does, it takes 1d6 damage for every 2 extra damage  
    it deals this way. (It must deal the extra damage if it changes a  
    miss into a hit.)

8.  *Unreal scent:* Humanoid enemies that move into engagement with the  
    unclean-one must immediately roll a save or take 5 poison damage  
    (champion: 10 damage, epic 15: damage). Non-humanoid enemies  
    (including druids in beast form, those who have taken undead form  
    with the aid of necromantic spells, construct races, ooze races,  
    etc.) might be more susceptible (hard save, 16+), or less  
    susceptible (easy save, 6+), GM’s call.

All unclean-ones get the following ability

*Unreasonable master:* The true-fomori can reach into the unclean-one’s  
mind to give them visions and look through their memories. In this way  
the fomori keeps an eye on its far-flung cults, and gives guidance to  
its heralds, even speaking directly through them if it desires. Oh, and  
those visions can be instructive religious apparitions, pleasing dreams  
sent as rewards, or terrifying and painful hallucinations sent as  
punishment (or because the fomori felt like inflicting suffering).

<u>Fomorian Mutation Nastier Specials</u>

Roll on the table below if you wish. You can also give fomorians some  
unclean-one abilities (though never unearthly beauty).

1.  *Extra arm:* When the escalation die is odd, the fomorian can make  
    one extra melee attack per round as a quick action.

2.  *Extra eyes:* The fomorian has a cluster of small eyes in the back  
    of its head, a huge eye on a shoulder, a slug-like eye stalk, etc.  
    The fomorian can’t be surprised or ambushed, and it has *true sight*  
    (spells like *blur*, *invisibility*, etc. don’t work on it).

3.  *Fair is foul:* Once per turn as a free action, the fomorian can  
    make the following attack:

> **C: Evil eye +11 vs. PD (one nearby or faraway enemy, but not one  
> that has been targeted by this attack since the start of the last  
> round)**—10 ongoing damage, and the target’s skin and bones painfully  
> twist to make them hideous to behold. At the start of each day,  
> provided they receive some form of magical healing, the twisted victim  
> rolls a save with a bonus equal to their Charisma or Constitution  
> modifier (whichever is lower) to recover their original appearance.
>
> *Limited use:* Once one target has been hit by this attack, no further  
> *evil eye* attacks can be made by any fomorian this battle.

4.  *Thick skin:* +1 AC and +2 PD.

<u>True-Fomori Houses Nastier Specials</u>

Each of the greater fomori had many offspring, the true-fomori. While  
true-fomori are each unique you can usually tell which calde a  
true-fomori originated in.

Use the following nastier special groups when you want to summon on the  
offspring of a specific greater fomori. You can also add in some  
fomorian mutations and unclean-one abilities if you like.

<u>House of Songs</u>

These fomori sing songs that drive listeners to insanity.

*Song of the House:* When the escalation die is odd, the enemy with the  
highest MD must roll a save at the start of the round. If it fails, it’s  
confused until the end of its next turn. When the escalation die is  
even, the same effect applies to the enemy with the lowest MD. The  
fomori chooses if enemies are tied for highest or lowest MD.

*Ear-bleed:* The ears of all non-fomori creatures in the battle begin to  
bleed, and continue to do so until the end of the day. Until the next  
full heal-up, those creatures take a –4 penalty to skill checks  
involving social situations or detecting sounds.

*Discordancy:* The first time each battle the true fomori is staggered,  
each of its enemies in the battle is hampered until the end of its next  
turn.

<u>House of Eyes</u>

These fomori usually have lots of eyes, or a single prominent eye, and  
fly by hovering.

*Hovering flight:* This creature flies, its host’s unwashed and diseased  
feet hovering inches above the ground.

*Eye beam:* Once per turn as a quick action, the fomori can fire a  
powerful ray from one or more of its eyes.

**R: Eye beam +5 +fomori’s level vs. PD**—7 ongoing force damage  
(champion: 14 damage; epic: 21 damage)

*Natural 16+:* The target pops free from enemies it’s engaged with and  
can’t engage any enemies until it saves against the ongoing force  
damage.

*Eye theft:* When a creature is staggered, it begins to feel as if its  
eyes are being pulled out by an invisible force. It takes a –1 penalty  
to hit and damage. Enemies that die in the presence of this fomori do  
indeed have their eyes sucked out as the fomori absorbs the eyeballs.

<u>House of Nightmares</u>

These fomori shift their forms instinctually, constantly devolving into  
ever-more horrible creatures.

*Shifting from Nightmares:* When the true-fomori is hit by an attack  
that targets PD or MD, until the start of its next turn, the values of  
its PD and MD switch and it gains a bonus to AC equal to the escalation  
die.

*Nightmares:* After a battle with the fomori, the character with the  
lowest MD (randomly choose on a tie) has a nightmare during the  
following night, with a 50% chance that the nightmare somehow comes true  
the next day.

*Skin theft:* You know that trick with the tablecloth? When the  
true-fomori scores a critical hit, it does that to some of its target’s  
skin, and the target is stunned (save ends). Replacing the skin might  
take more than normal healing, too, and it might take a while to look  
right on a creature again.

<u>House of Spiders</u>

These true-fomori tend to have lots of legs and can control spiders,  
scorpions, ticks, and other arachnids.

*Scuttle:* The true-fomori can climb like a spider and squeeze its body  
down to scuttle swiftly under low openings.

*Bite:* Once per turn as a quick action, the true-fomori can make the  
following attack to inject acid into its victim and drink its innards.

**Draining bite +5 + fomori’s level vs. AC**—7 acid damage (champion: 14  
damage; epic: 21 damage)

*Natural 16+:* The target heals using a recovery, but the true-fomori  
gains the hit points.

*Sun-eating:* A creature staggered by this fomori can no longer see the  
sun the following day and must rely on lantern light or magical  
illumination. There is a 50% chance each day thereafter that the  
adventurer recovers and can once again see sunlight and feels its  
warmth. While a creature is unable to see or feel the healing sun,  
whenever it rolls recovery dice, it must reroll any die that has the  
maximum result (for example, a 10 on a d10).

<u>House of Colors</u>

These true-fomori have plumage or fur in unnatural madness-causing  
colors.

*Color out of time:* An enemy making a ranged attack against the  
true-fomori takes a penalty to the attack equal to the escalation die  
and can’t use the escalation die for that attack.

*Color drain:* When the true-fomori drops a creature to 0 hp or lower,  
that creature is drained of all color and can no longer perceive color.  
While under this effect, the creature takes a –4 penalty to social skill  
checks and a –1 penalty to saves. Restoring color to the creature  
requires a quest involving walking a sacred labyrinth.

### Frogfolk

<u>Special Abilities for All Frogspawn</u>

You should certainly use one ability per frogspawn, occasionally two.  
For frogspawn mooks, treat the abilities as usable once per battle.

*Disgusting tongue:* The frogspawn deals poison damage equal to its  
level to any character that pops free of it or successfully disengages  
from it. (Teleporting away is probably tongue-free unless the GM is  
hopping mad.)

*Dunk and cover:* If the battle is taking place in a swamp, lake, or  
river, whenever the frogspawn misses with a natural even attack roll, it  
can duck out of sight. Remove the frogspawn from the table until the  
start of its next turn. At the start of its next turn, place it anywhere  
nearby its previous location, but not engaged with an enemy.

*Erratic leap (move action):* If the frogspawn is unengaged at the start  
of its turn, choose a random nearby enemy the frogspawn can see. The  
frogspawn leaps into engagement with that enemy and its crit range with  
melee attacks expands by 3 until the end of the turn.

*Paranoid destroyer:* This frogspawn can’t be surprised. If there’s a  
surprise round, it gets to act. If there isn’t a surprise round at the  
start of combat, the frogspawn gets a surprise round if its natural  
initiative roll is 16+. On the down side, subtract 2 from this  
frogspawn’s MD, because it’s always sure it’s going to die. (Gamemaster:  
Don’t give this ability to all the frogspawn in a battle. Just one or  
two.)

<p><strong>C: Eruption of Frogs +9 vs. PD (all engaged

the spellcroaker</p>
<p><em>Limited use:</em> 1/battle</p>
<p><em>Croaking chorus:</em> At the start of each round, all
spellcroakers in a battle start to croak together in chorus. This
imposes a special bonus or penalty depending on the croak generated by
the chorus that round (roll 1d6).</p>
<p><em>1-2: Croak of Dismay:</em> If the number of spellcroakers is
equal to or greater than the value of the escalation die, then the
player characters do not get the benefit of the escalation die, but all
frogs and frogfolk may add the value of the escalation die to their
attack rolls instead.</p>
<p><em>3–4: Croak of Victory:</em> All attacks by frogfolk gain a bonus
to damage equal to the number of croakers.</p>
<p><em>5-6: Croak of Choking:</em> Over the course of the round, you may
force the player characters to reroll a number of d20 rolls (attack
rolls, saving throws, skill checks, death saves) equal to the number of
croakers.</p>
<p>When a spellcroaker drops to 0 hit points, roll a d20—on a 11+, the
remaining spellcroakers maintain the <em>croaking chorus</em> for the
rest of the round. Otherwise, the chorus effect is cancelled for the

for the purposes of the <em>croaking chorus</em>.</p>
<p><em>Frog Curse:</em> If a spellcroaker rolls a natural 18+ when using
a curse, the target is transformed into a steadily shrinking frog-like
humanoid and is hampered and weakened (save ends all effects). If the
curse somehow ran its full course, the target would no doubt shrink down
into a frog, but PCs are made of strong stuff and should be able to
evade a fate that might affect common folk.</p></td>

it’s smaller than the dodecahedron</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> The cube can make a <em>spasms</em> attack as a free
action.</p>
<p><em>[Special trigger]</em> <strong>C: Spasms +10 vs. AC (up to 2
attacks, each against a different nearby enemy)</strong>—15 damage</p>
<p><em>Engulf and dissolve:</em> Targets engulfed/grabbed by the cube
take 30 acid damage at the start of the cube’s turn but are not viable
targets for additional attacks by the cube. Multiple targets can be held
within the cube simultaneously.</p>
<p>Any engulfed creature that is also staggered must begin making last
gasp saves or become paralyzed as the cube’s toxins overwhelm it.</p>
<p><em>Instinctive actions:</em> Gelatinous creatures have no brains,
sometimes they just <em>do things</em>. When the escalation die is odd,
instead of making an attack or moving, roll a d12 to see what the
dodecahedron does. If an option is not available (you roll a 1 but there
are no nearby enemies), reroll until you get a valid option.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> The dodecahedron makes a <em>squash</em> attack
against 1d4 nearby enemies as it rolls and shlorps around the area. Any
enemies already engulfed by the dodecahedron take 10 thunder damage.</p>
<p><strong>C: Squash +10 vs. PD (1d4 nearby enemies)</strong>—20 damage,
and the target is stunned (easy save ends, 6+)</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> The dodecahedron throws out whip-like tendrils
and makes a <em>sudden orifice</em> attack against each enemy engaged
with it. Then it pulls each nearby enemy next to it and engages that
creature.</p>
<p><strong>Sudden orifice +12 vs. PD (each enemy engaged with
it)</strong>—The dodecahedron engulfs the target if it’s smaller than
the dodecahedron</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Hundreds of finger-size slimes slither out from
the interior of the dodecahedron and begin worming their way across the
bodies of each of its enemies in the battle. Until the end of the
battle, when a non-ooze creature takes any damage besides ongoing acid
damage, it also takes 10 acid damage.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> The dodecahedron bounces and thrums. Each enemy
engaged with it or engulfed by it must roll a save; on a failure, that
enemy takes 30 thunder damage. On a success, it takes 15 thunder damage
and pops free from the dodecahedron.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> The dodecahedron hunkers down and produces acidic
spikes. It gains a +4 bonus to all defenses until the end of the battle,
and each enemy who makes a melee attack against it with a non-magical
weapon must roll a save; on a failure the weapon dissolves. When a
creature’s weapon dissolves, that creature is hampered and weakened
(save ends both). Magical weapons lose their bonuses to hit and damage
until the end of the battle instead of being dissolved (but the owner is
still hampered and weakened). They can be “restored” after the battle by
taking a few minutes during a rest to re-attune them.</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> The dodecahedron moves, rolling around the
battlefield, then makes a <em>shlup’n’schlorp</em> attack at the end of
its movement with a +5 bonus. If the attack misses, instead of making a
<em>spasms</em> attack the dodecahedron rolls about the area again and
makes a second <em>shlup’n’schlorp</em> attack with a +10 bonus. If the
second attack misses, it doesn’t get a spasms attack and the
dodecahedron’s turn ends.</p>
<p><strong>7.</strong> The dodecahedron makes a <em>spasms</em> attack.
If it misses with either attack roll, after the attacks, it can make a
<em>stretch and engulf</em> attack as a free action.</p>
<p><strong>C: Stretch and engulf +12 vs. PD (one nearby or faraway
enemy)</strong>—30 acid damage, and the dodecahedron engulfs the target
if it’s smaller than the dodecahedron</p>
<p><strong>8. C: Pseudopod slaps +10 vs. AC (one nearby
enemy)</strong>—25 thunder damage</p>
<p><em>Natural odd hit:</em> The target pops free from the dodecahedron
and is knocked faraway, and the ooze makes the attack again against a
different nearby enemy as a free action.</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit:</em> The dodecahedron engulfs the target if
it’s smaller than the dodecahedron.</p>
<p><strong>9.</strong> Each enemy engulfed by the dodecahedron takes 40
acid damage, and the dodecahedron heals 40 hp for each enemy it has
engulfed.</p>
<p><strong>10.</strong> The dodecahedron splits into an octahedron and a
tetrahedron, and each one can act this turn (roll a d8 and d4 for the
<em>instinctive actions</em> of each one). Divide the dodecahedron’s
current hit points into thirds, and give one third to the tetrahedron
and two thirds to the octahedron.</p>
<p><strong>11.</strong> The dodecahedron splits into three tetrahedrons,
and each one can act this turn (roll a d4 for the <em>instinctive
actions</em> of each one). Divide the dodecahedron’s current hit points
equally between the three new creatures.</p>
<p><strong>12.</strong> The dodecahedron splits into two cubahedrons,
and each one can act this turn (roll a d6 for the <em>instinctive
actions</em> of each one). Divide the dodecahedron’s current hit points
equally between the two new creatures.</p></td>

### Ghost

<u>Abilities for Most Ghosts</u>

Most ghosts have several or all of the following abilities. Normally we  
use these sections to cover abilities possessed by all the monsters of a  
certain type, but there’s enough variation in ghost stories that we  
figure we should provide tools for you to choose from rather than try to  
force ghosts into one style of haunting.

For the record, all ghosts also have some version of the *ghostly*  
ability, but its strength varies so we’ve put it into each stat block.

*Bound hauntings:* Most ghosts are bound to an area, usually the area of  
their death. This ability won’t come up much in play, but it does make  
it seem likely that ghosts can be easier to get away from than other  
monsters. Move far enough fast enough and the ghost returns to the area  
it’s bound to. Occasionally festivals for the dead or other rituals can  
call bound ghosts from their hauntings, but those are unusual and  
temporary circumstances.

**Exceptions:** There may be ghosts that are bound to people, or events,  
or phenomena that travel. There might even be ghosts that aren’t bound  
to anything, but at that stage there are several other questions that  
surface and odd magical, iconic, or unique intervention seems likely.

*Flight:* Most ghosts fly, though some may be quite slow, seeming to  
drift or walking on air. Ghosts that fly in unusual ways will be flagged  
with their own abilities.

**Exceptions:** Not all ghosts fly. Some seem constrained to act much  
like they acted when they were alive, and flying wasn’t part of their  
life package.

*Unnatural touch:* Many ghosts can alter the temperature of their  
environment to more closely match the underworld or afterlife that  
they’ve so far evaded. Sometimes that’s icy cold, sometimes that’s  
burning hot, and sometimes it’s just kind of normal, which would go  
unnoticed unless the ghost is somewhere abnormal!

**Exceptions:** This is more of a special effect of ghost stories than  
part of a creature’s combat abilities, and you can safely ignore it  
unless you find telling moments when it adds to the game.

weapon or attack that ended their lives. Interpret this liberally,
GM.</p>

staggered. When they’re staggered, they sink to the ground and stay
there.</p></td>

### Ghoul

For nastier specials, instead of a slow, poisonous bite, a more deadly  
bite can also make things challenging for adventurers. Each time a ghoul  
bites a character, that PC immediately loses a recovery. If they run out  
of recoveries before their next full heal-up, that character must start  
making last gasp saves at the start of each battle. If the character  
fails their fourth last gasp save this way, they turn into a ghoul.

### Gibbering Mouther

<u>Abilities for All Gibbering Mouthers</u>

Gibbering mouthers have the following abilities:

*Eyes everywhere:* Gibbering mouthers can’t be ambushed or sneaked up  
on.

In addition, though gibbering mouthers are aberrations they are  
ooze-like enough that they use the ooze abilities flows where it likes  
and ooze.

*Flows where it likes:* The gibbering mouther is immune to opportunity  
attacks.

*Ooze:* The gibbering mouther is immune to effects. When an attack  
applies a condition to a gibbering mouther (dazed, hampered, weakened,  
ongoing damage, etc.), that condition doesn’t affect it.

<p><em>Awe (fear effect):</em> While nearby the golem, enemies with 40
hp or fewer are dazed (–4 attack) and do not add the escalation die to
their attacks.</p>
<p><em>Beauty:</em> The first time each enemy attacks the marble golem
this battle, it must roll a normal save; on a failure, the attack takes
a –6 penalty.</p>
<p><em>Courage:</em> While staggered, the marble golem adds the
escalation die to its attack rolls.</p>
<p><em>Endurance:</em> When the marble golem rolls a natural 1–5 with an
attack roll, it heals 1d10 hit points per point on the escalation die.
(It was checking for damage and got distracted.)</p>
<p><em>Hatred:</em> When an enemy is staggered by the marble golem’s
attack, that enemy takes 4d10 extra damage.</p>
<p><em>Patience:</em> Each turn, the marble golem can use one standard
action to gain a +2 bonus to all defenses until the start of its next
turn. If it does, it gains an extra standard action during its next
turn.</p>
<p><em>Protection:</em> When the marble golem rolls a natural 16+ with
an attack, decrease the escalation die by 1.</p>
<p><em>Strength:</em> The marble golem’s melee attacks now deal half
damage on a miss.</p>

### Hag

Hags get two of the following abilities, and a single death curse.

<u>Hag Abilities: Choose TWO</u>

**Adept Illusionist:** The hag gains a +5 bonus to initiative checks due  
to being not quite where she seems.

*Hag ability:* As a distraction, the hag creates an illusion of her  
doing one thing, when she is in fact setting a trap. The hag throws out  
a bear-trap or other impediment and one nearby enemy becomes stuck (save  
ends). While stuck this way, the target takes 6 damage at the start of  
each of its turns.

**Another skin:** On the hag’s first round of combat each battle, she  
gains a +2 attack bonus due to her victims being shocked as she bursts  
out of her false outer skin.

*Hag ability:* The hag coughs up a glob of liquid pseudo-flesh that  
globs onto a nearby enemy (no attack roll). The glob solidifies causing  
an effect of the hag’s choice: the target is stuck (save ends); OR the  
target is unable to cast spells during its next turn (the pseudo-flesh  
covers their mouth and face).

**Blood pact:** Each creature allied to the hag through a pact gains a  
+2 bonus with their first attack each battle if the hag is present.

*Hag ability:* The hag spits blood in the face of the target and makes a  
command. The target must roll an immediate save; on a failure, as a free  
action it makes basic attack against an ally or against itself (target’s  
choice).

**Breath stealing:** The hag starts combat with 10 temporary hit points.

*Hag ability:* The hag steals a recovery from the target and heals 20  
hp.

**Death shriek:** When a melee attack hits the hag, she lets out a  
shriek as a free action and the attacker takes 2d4 thunder damage.

*Hag ability:* The hag begins to shriek, and each enemy in the battle  
takes a –4 attack penalty with spells until the start of her next turn.

**Dusk walk:** Once per day the hag can implant a suggestion in the mind  
of a target sleeping within a day’s travel of her. The hag rolls an  
attack: **+10 vs. MD**; on a hit, she implants a suggestion in the  
target that they must obey when a condition she chooses is met.  
Suggested actions can’t cause direct harm (the target can’t be forced to  
fight another or harm themselves), can be no longer than 12 words, and  
affects the target for a week or until triggered. GM keeps the roll  
hidden.

*Hag ability:* The hag becomes immaterial, pops free from all enemies  
engaged with her, and enters the land of dreams, re-appearing next to  
any nearby conscious creature (or a nearby or faraway creature that is  
unconscious). The hag then makes the following attack: **C: +10 vs. MD  
(each nearby unconscious enemy)**—The hag implants a suggestion in the  
target that they must obey when they become conscious (usually “When you  
awake, flee this fight and discard your equipment.”) Suggested actions  
can’t cause direct harm. The round after the target acts on the  
implanted suggestion it can start rolling normal saves to throw off the  
effect.

**Fateful visions:** The hag uses a +2 magical weapon traded to her for  
her services (she gains a +2 bonus to attack and damage with melee  
attacks).

*Hag ability:* The hag has seen this fight in a vision. Her crit range  
expands by 2 until the end of the battle. Each increase is cumulative.

**Foul-touched:** When an enemy is battling the hag, at the start of  
each of its turns, it takes 2d6 psychic damage from the horror of the  
hag’s visage unless it takes precautions to avoid directly glancing at  
her terrible face (mirror, blindfold, etc., which might cause attack  
penalties).

*Hag ability:* The hag chooses a nearby enemy and glares at it. That  
target must roll an immediate save; on a failure, the target is stricken  
blind by her ugliness. While blinded this way, the target is hampered,  
weakened, and can’t make ranged attacks. The target can end the effect  
by splashing liquid into their eyes or using a similar act to clear the  
ugly out as a standard action.

**Song of dreams:** Enemies take a –4 penalty to their initiative rolls  
in battles with the hag.

*Hag ability:* The hag begins to sing and the two enemies closest to her  
(even if faraway) must roll an immediate save; on a failure, the target  
is dazed (save ends). If the dazed target fails its first save, instead  
it’s weakened (save ends). If the weakened target fails its second save,  
instead it’s helpless (save ends).

**Thief of mist:** The hag ignores opportunity attacks and can’t be  
intercepted while moving.

*Hag ability:* The hag becomes a mist until the start of her next turn.  
While a mist, only spells cast with a +3 implement and attacks using a  
+3 magical weapon can harm her. (Some special story item might also  
allow attacks to hit if no PC has a +3 item.)

**Twist the path:** Once per day the hag can enspell an area to attract  
visitors, causing those traveling nearby to get lost and wander to that  
location. Alternately, the hag can cause the location to repel visitors.  
Finding the correct path to that location requires a DC 20 check if it  
is a familiar place, a DC 25 check if the travelers only have a map or  
guide, or a DC 30 check if the travelers are unfamiliar with the area.

*Hag ability:* The target is also confused (easy save ends, 6+).

**Weakening touch:** Each enemy fighting the hag must roll a normal save  
at the start of the battle; on a failure, that creature starts the  
battle weakened (easy save ends, 6+).

*Hag ability:* The target is dazed (save ends). If the dazed target  
fails its first save, instead it’s weakened (save ends). When the target  
saves against this effect, it takes a –2 attack penalty until the end of  
its next turn.

**Winter breath:** The hag’s attacks deal cold damage.

*Hag ability:* The target takes 6 ongoing cold damage.

<u>Death Curses: Create ONE</u>

When a hag dies she curses the one who killed her. The only known way to  
remove the curse is to seek the aid of another hag, though there may be  
some ways to end such a curse that are not readily known.

Create one curse per hag. A good curse makes life horribly weird for a  
character, but isn’t something that debilitates them. Avoid ones that  
blind, deafen, cripple, or mute characters. Odd habits, ugly features,  
unusual smells, strange and disgusting diets—all these are good. They  
should make the character and the story more interesting.

to overcome the delusion and see the truth of it (if a player gives a
reason for not trusting what their character sees; perhaps add subtle
clues toward that end). The magic fades as soon as the hag enters
combat.</p>

### Hallowed Gargoyle

<u>Nastier Specials for all Hallowed Gargoyles</u>

These nastier specials also apply to temple lions.

*Mirrored aggression:* Hallowed gargoyles have some ability to sense  
intentions and a larger capacity to react appropriately! PCs with a  
negative or conflicted relationship with the Religious Icon are  
vulnerable to all the hallowed gargoyles’ attacks.

*Statues, statues, everywhere:* Because they look so much like statues,  
and because most of the things that look like hallowed gargoyles are  
statues, hallowed gargoyles are capable of springing a surprise on  
inattentive PCs. When there’s a chance of such an ambush, give the PCs a  
normal skill check (DC 20 at champion-tier, DC 25 at epic tier) to  
notice the gargoyles waking and avoid being surprised (13<sup>th</sup>  
Age core rulebook, page 164).

### Hellwarped Beast

<u>Aberrant Attack Table</u>

Roll a d6 to determine what type of additional attack(s) the hellwarped  
beast has, and its general characteristics. Use the first set of stats  
for the brutes, and the second for the spawn.

**1. Biting mandibles +15/+11 vs. AC**—50/13 damage, and the target is  
stuck (save ends); while the target is stuck this way, at the start of  
the hellwarped’s turn, it automatically deals 50/13 damage to the target  
but can’t make an *aberrant attack* that turn.

**2. Extra claw +15/+11 vs. AC**—75/19 damage (and the claw can benefit  
from the *dual miss* effect).

**3. Lashing tentacle +15/+11 vs. PD**—20/5 damage, and the target is  
weakened (save ends); the first time the target fails this save, it  
becomes stunned instead (save ends).

**4. C: Antennae waveburst +15/+11 vs. MD (one nearby enemy)**—20/5  
psychic damage, and the target must roll an immediate save. If it fails,  
it’s confused until the end of its next turn.

**5. R: Shooting quills +15/+11 vs. AC (one nearby enemy not engaged  
with it)**—40/10 damage. In addition, it takes only half damage from  
opportunity attacks thanks to the spikes covering it.

**6.** *\[use only when triggered as an aberrant attack\]* **Charging  
horn slam +15/+11 vs. PD**—50/13 damage, and the target is dazed (save  
ends).

> *Free charge:* The hellwarped pops free from each enemy engaged with  
> it after making its *claws* attacks, then moves to a nearby enemy as a  
> free action and makes this attack.

### Horned Azinth

Due to the horned azinth’s ability to move about undetected, it’s likely  
that the adventurers are going to run into trouble with them by  
accidentally wandering into the midst of a herd. If that happens, the  
horned azinth will ambush the heroes. Use this variant on the standard  
ambush and surprise rules.

First, 1d3 + 1 horned azinth get to act before initiative is rolled  
instead of only two of the beasts. Second, if you normally advance the  
escalation die at the end of the surprise round, don’t do it. The azinth  
are too well concealed for momentum to favor the heroes.

#### Chaos Hydra

This hydra starts with four heads, but they’re not always the same  
heads! Roll a d6 four times before the fight begins to find out which  
heads the chaos hydra starts the battle with. A head that starts the  
fight may not finish the battle, heads shift mid-fight, and as usual for  
hydras, new heads sprout when the creature takes serious damage.

*One attack per head:* As for the more generic hydras, each of the chaos  
hydra’s heads can make an attack when it uses a standard action. Unlike  
those other hydras, each separate head is going to have its own attack  
style, though it’s possible that the hydra will randomly have two or  
more of the same type of head for a couple rounds!

*Heads with bonuses:* A few of the heads provide abilities or bonuses as  
well as one or two possible attacks. For a change, these bonuses are  
cumulative. For example, a chaos hydra with two draconic heads would  
have a +4 bonus to its AC. Since the heads shift frequently, those  
bonuses won’t last forever.

### Kobold

All kobolds have the *trapster* ability. When a kobold makes a  
*trapster* attack and rolls a natural attack roll that is higher than  
the target’s Wisdom, the creature has maneuvered the target into a trap  
with the attack. A creature can only be subjected to one trap per round.

When a kobold triggers its *trapster* ability, determine the damage the  
trap deals by rolling a 1d4, then adding the escalation die. If there’s  
a dungeon-shaman in the battle, use a d8 instead of a d4.

Kobold traps can deal ongoing damage to the target instead of regular  
damage, if that makes sense for the trap. For ongoing damage, roll 1d4  
(or 1d8) plus the escalation die, and then subtract one (minimum 1).

Kobold traps can impose conditions upon the target, if you choose. Roll  
normal trap damage, but the trap only deals half damage (minimum 1).  
Then roll a d4 for the condition the trap imposes upon the target until  
the end of its next turn.

1.  The target is stuck.

2.  The target is hampered.

3.  The target is dazed.

4.  The target is vulnerable.

Trap types vary according to the location/terrain and the whim of the  
GM.

### Kohwa

<u>Abilities for all kohwa</u>

*Flight:* Kohwa are winged, and therefore capable of flight. While they  
are strong fliers and able to travel great distances in this way, they  
are acutely aware of how ungainly they look while doing so, and  
therefore prefer to walk or run unless they are certain no one is  
watching.

*Swimming:* Unlike many cat species, kohwa are perfectly at home in the  
water, so diving into a lake or river is a poor defense against them.

*Telepathy:* Kohwa are capable of short-range telepathy with non-kohwa.  
It is assumed (although no one is entirely sure) that they are capable  
of communicating with others of their species at greater distances, as  
when one is in trouble, others are sure to appear—eventually.

already targeted this turn.</p>
<p><strong>C: Judgment of the gods +11 vs. PD (1d4 nearby

<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p><em>Invocation of the gods’ protection:</em> Once per battle, as a
quick action, the kohwa messenger can invoke the protection of their
unknown gods. Once the invocation has been made, at the start of each of
the messenger’s turns, roll 1d6. As long as the roll is equal to or less
than the escalation die, critical hits against the messenger and its
allies only inflict normal damage (although they do still trigger the
kohwa enforcer’s <em>acid rain</em> attack, if appropriate). As soon as
the roll fails, the protection lapses.</p>
<p><strong>R: Implacable dread +11 vs. MD</strong>—The target is
weakened (normal save ends). During the next round, if the target is
unengaged, it takes no action other than to move away from the
messenger. If engaged, then the target’s first action is to attempt to
disengage from its foe, moving away if successful. If the target fails
the disengage check, they use their second action to move away, inviting
opportunity attacks</p>
<p><em>Limited use:</em> Cannot be used until the escalation die reaches
4+.</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> The target develops a deep and abiding mistrust of all
kohwa.</p></td>

maintains the initiative of its host, but any conditions placed upon the

behemoth, the koruku detaches itself from its host and leaps onto the

which hardens into a cocoon. The host reverts back to its original

### Kroma Dragonic

<u>Nastier Specials for All Kroma Dragonics</u>

If you’d like to make your dragonic wyrmspawn more deadly, give them  
wings and limited flight. Or if your dragonics have the blood of the  
mighty wyrms flowing through them (or the magic of dragons has worn off  
on them), consider giving some of them a random dragon ability.

*Limited flight:* At the start of each turn, roll a d6. If the result is  
less than or equal to the escalation die, the dragonic gains flight as a  
move action during its turns thanks to a pair of wings it unfurls from  
its back. The flight tends to be more power-flapping or gliding from one  
place to another rather than hovering. Flamewings who also have limited  
flight prefer to use their burning wings to fly in combat wherever  
possible, resorting to their physical wings only if needed.

*Blood of the wyrm:* This dragonic displays traits of its forebears, the  
mighty wyrms. Roll a d10 and consult the random dragon ability table, or  
choose one of the first ten options that looks likely to shape the story  
or battle.

ablaze, which might benefit one side or the other in the battle (or harm
both).</p>

of flame. However, its turning circle isn’t great and it can’t hover, so
in tight quarters it needs to land. Also, its wings are made of fire,
and overusing its <em>fireball breath</em> can cause the wings to gutter
and fade.</p>

### Lammasu

*Flight:* All lammasu fly. Warrior lammasu fly with upright dignity,  
sometimes a bit slower than is wise. Fallen lammasu fly well enough to  
keep up with all but the quickest demons. Lammasu wizards and priests  
fly more gracefully than the warriors, but only because they’re less  
eager to run into things.

*Minor servitors:* When a lammasu isn’t in combat or resting in  
stone-form, it’s usually surrounded by a fawning retinue of spirit  
servants. The servants look like people from ages the world no longer  
remembers. They stick close to the lammasu, seldom or never speak, and  
in truth may be a projection of the lammasu’s spirit or will. The  
spirits are no use in combat, but they can manipulate small objects such  
as combs and scented perfumes to use upon the lammasu’s beard, hair, and  
jewelry.

*Stone rest:* Outside the overworld, lammasu who wish to rest can  
transform themselves into solid stone. A lammasu can see and hear as if  
it were still made of flesh. It can change back to flesh as a free  
action, but must wait a day before returning to stone, which is no great  
delay for lammasu guardians whose positions extend for decades or  
centuries. Considering that many sculptors carve stone lammasu to place  
in front of or within important structures, it’s deliberately difficult  
for a thief or assassin to know whether he is facing a stone statue or a  
transformed beast.

Note that this form of solid stone is different from the living stone  
form sometimes adopted by the lammasu warrior, wizard, and priest during  
battle.

### Naga

<u>Nastier Special for all naga:</u>

Arcane balance: Whenever the naga rolls a natural 1–5 with an attack  
roll, it can cancel one magical effect created by a spell or magic item  
that is affecting the naga or a nearby creature (including beneficial  
effect on a PC). It can be an ongoing effect, an effect that only lasts  
a round, or even an effect that was supposed to last until the end of  
the battle. Use your sense of what is magical and what isn’t: a bard’s  
song is clearly magical, but a rogue’s Shadow Walk talent probably  
isn’t, despite the wizard’s arguments that it *should* be.

charger form and happily mounts the beast (treat it as a teleport for
simplicity’s sake). Once they are astride, the waterhorse attempts to
flee into the nearest body of water, taking the rider with them. To
prevent this, the rider can attempt a DC 25 Strength-based control check
as a quick action (1d20 + level + Strength modifier + any relevant
background + escalation die). If they succeed, the rider gains control
of the creature and can either dismount or steer it to where they wish,
potentially with a view to stealing its bridle on their next turn
(requiring a successful attack roll with that specified aim). If the
rider does not attempt to steal the bridle on their next turn, they must
make another DC 25 check to remain in control. Stealing the bridle turns
the waterhorse into its humanoid form and throws the rider clear. If the
rider fails to control the creature at any point, it converts its next
standard action to a move action, using it and any other move actions it
may have to enter the water and trigger its watery grave attack 1 round
later. The rider can continue to make control checks until <em>watery
grave</em> is activated.</p>
<p><em>Limited use:</em> Beast form only, and only when the escalation
die is 3+.</p>
<p><em>[Special trigger]</em> <strong>Watery grave</strong>—Any creature
not in control of the waterhorse is dragged beneath the surface of the
lake. They no longer make control checks and instead begin to make last
gasp saves. If they accrue five failures, they drown. Their bones will
make a nice addition to the pile, as soon as the waterhorse has finished
gnawing on them.</p>
<p><em>Shapechanger:</em> As a standard action, the waterhorse can
change between its true hairy humanoid appearance and its black charger
disguise. A successful DC 25 skill check is required to see through the
shapechange. If the waterhorse loses its bridle, it cannot change shape
again until it recovers it. Blame the creature’s lack of imagination for
its limited forms.</p>

### Nymph

<u>Standard powers for all nymphs</u>

*Domain bound:* Nymphs are tied to an area of land or water. Land areas  
will be at most a couple miles wide; water areas might be much larger.  
As a rule, nymphs can’t leave the area they’re bound to.

*Limited immortality:* A nymph that drops to 0 hit points or is  
otherwise slain will eventually return to life in its domain, so long as  
its domain and its secret survives. After an hour, a nymph needs a hard  
save to return to life. After eight hours, a nymph needs a normal save  
to return to life. If the nymph has still not returned, roll an easy  
save at the end of each 24 hours until the nymph succeeds.

*Note on types:* The following nymphs with the humanoid type probably  
remember themselves. Nymphs that have probably forgotten their original  
selves have the elemental type.

<p><strong>C: Watery words +10 vs. MD (one nearby enemy)</strong>—The

<p>The river’s song: When a creature is confused from the naiad’s
<em>watery words</em> attack, it immediately moves into the water next
to the naiad as a free action to defend the naiad. The target takes half
the damage of the next attack that hits the naiad. During its turn, it
doesn’t attack, instead moving to stay next to the naiad. Each time the
target fails its save, it will again defend the naiad against the next
attack that hits it, taking half damage.</p>
<p><em>One with the river:</em> A naiad can walk on the surface of
water, making it seem shallow, and it can swim through the water and
breathe underwater with ease. Its enemies might have a more difficult
time engaging it.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Special</u></p>
<p><em>Naiad’s cleansing:</em> Each time a target confused by <em>watery
words</em> fails its save, it will forget something important. GM’s
choice or player’s suggestion!</p></td>

<p><em>6. Cyan:</em> The target is stunned (save ends).</p>
<p><em>7. Purple:</em> The target is dazed and confused (save ends
both). When the target saves, it takes 40 psychic damage.</p>

Remove that creature from play, returning it to the battle in (or near)
its previous location at the end of its next turn. No time seems to pass
for the target while it’s gone.</p>
<p><em>Resist exceptional attacks 16+:</em> When a limited attack (not
an at-will attack) targets this creature, the attacker must roll a
natural 16+ on the attack roll or it only deals half damage.</p>
<p><em>Warp:</em> The prismatic ogre mage warps reality with its
presence. Each character hit by the <em>prismatic blast</em> attack
during battle must write down one true personal trait or preference
about their character such as: “Yellow hair”, “Afraid of spiders”,
“Prefers white wine to red”, or “Tattoo of a halfling on left bicep”.
These personal traits are shuffled and randomly distributed equally by
the GM after the battle is over. Whichever trait each player receives is
now true for their character as well as for the character of the player
who wrote it down (unless there has somehow turned out to be a swap…).
These traits don’t alter game mechanics (feats, powers, backgrounds,
icon relationships, attributes, bonuses, etc.). They are personal
details that have been warped and scrambled by the prismatic ogre mage’s
magic.</p></td>

### Ooze

All oozes have the following two abilities:

*Flows where it likes:* The ooze is immune to opportunity attacks.

*Ooze:* The ooze is immune to effects. When an attack applies a  
condition to an ooze (dazed, hampered, weakened, ongoing damage, etc.),  
that condition doesn’t affect it.

<p><strong>Huge spiked flail +8 vs. AC</strong>—21 damage</p>
<p><em>Natural roll is above target’s Constitution:</em> The target
catches a disease (see below).</p>
<p>When a creature contracts a death-plague orc disease, roll a d4 for
the disease type and a d6 for that disease’s symptoms <em>after the
battle</em>. Until cured, at the start of each day (after each full
heal-up) the PC makes a Constitution check (including any appropriate
background) to determine the severity of the disease for that day, or if
the PC is cured.</p>
<p>Full bed rest under the care of a healer reduces severity roll from a
d6 to a d4 (so a severity check result of 18 would be 1d4 + 2 not 1d6 +
2). A PC under the care of and experience healer or someone who knows
healing magic gains a +10 bonus to the Constitution check. At the GM’s
option, special ingredients or healing items, found via quest, can give
additional bonuses to the check.</p>
<p>Disease Type (d4)</p>
<p>1: Filthy Fever</p>
<p>2: Chatter Pox</p>
<p>3: Slug Scourge</p>
<p>4: Red Fever</p>
<p>Disease Severity (Con check each day; result affects d6 symptoms
roll)</p>
<p>1–14: d6 + 3</p>
<p>15–19: d6 + 2</p>
<p>20–24: d6 + 1</p>
<p>25–29: d6 + 0</p>
<p>30+: Cured</p>
<p>Filthy Fever Symptoms (d6 roll for symptoms that day)</p>
<p>1: Slight temperature.</p>
<p>2–3: The runs. You gain 1 less recovery than normal after a full
heal-up due to fluid loss.</p>
<p>4+: You have a hacking cough that sounds like insane laughter and are
losing fluids. You gain 2 fewer recoveries than normal after a full
heal-up and can’t remain silent.</p>
<p>Chatter Pox Symptoms (d6 roll for symptoms that day)</p>
<p>1: Unsightly and painful sores, occasional shivers.</p>
<p>2–3: Running sores, shivering and chattering teeth. You take a –3
penalty to social skill checks and to attack rolls with spells.</p>
<p>4+: Infected sores, fever dreams. Your constitution is weakened.
After each full heal-up, roll 1d4 + 3 to determine your starting maximum
recoveries for that day. Each time you cast a spell that isn’t at-will,
there’s a 25% chance it fails (but you don’t expend the spell).</p>
<p>Slug Scourge Symptoms (d6 roll for symptoms that day)</p>
<p>1: Extreme appetite, nausea.</p>
<p>2–3: Vomiting up slugs. Whenever you make a non-combat Charisma
check, roll 2d20 and take the lower result.</p>
<p>4+: The slugs are inside your lungs! After each quick rest, you lose
25% of your maximum hit points. If you drop to 0 hp this way, you enter
into a coma until the next day.</p>
<p>Red Fever Symptoms (d6 roll for symptoms that day)</p>
<p>1: Scarlet stripes on the eyeballs, itching, buzzing in ears.</p>
<p>2–3: Blurred vision. You take a –3 penalty to ranged attacks.</p>
<p>4+: Fever, rage, and confusion. Whenever you roll a natural odd
attack roll, you are confused until the end of your next turn. Ranged
attacks have a 25% chance of accidentally targeting an ally (check
before making the attack roll).</p></td>

### Pixie

All pixies have the *glamour* ability.

*Glamour*: Outside of combat, pixies can create complex illusions at  
will. For the PC, it’s usually a normal or hard skill check to sort out  
what’s real.

the pixie warrior can make a <em>madness</em> attack against the target
as a free action.</p>
<p><em>[Special trigger]</em> <strong>Madness +8 vs. MD</strong>—The
target is maddened until the end of the pixie’s next turn. The first
thing the creature does on its turn is use a standard action to make a
display of power that has no practical benefit. The GM chooses the
attack, spell, or other power, which should be the most powerful one the
character has, preferably a daily. The target expends the power in a
great show of prowess, aimed for display rather than effect. Wizards
cast their fireballs into the sky, monks demonstrate flawless form while
shadow-boxing, and clerics bless the very stones underfoot instead of
allies.</p>
<p>When the madness effect gets old, substitute any of the following
effects, by choice or at random:</p>
<p><em>1:</em> You love pixies and hate those who threaten them. The
target is confused until the end of the pixie’s next turn.</p>
<p><em>2:</em> Brains knocked loose. The target takes 4 psychic damage
each time it takes an action (save ends; yes that could be 3 times per
round or more).</p>
<p><em>3:</em> Reality bender. The target takes 5 ongoing psychic
damage. Each time the target fails the save, the ongoing damage
increases by 5, cumulative.</p>
<p><em>4:</em> Massive attack on the unconscious mind. The target
chooses one: either let the onslaught slam its mind (take 15 psychic
damage), or steel its mind against the onslaught (stunned until the end
of the pixie’s next turn).</p>
<p><em>5:</em> Compulsion to dance. The target takes 5 ongoing psychic
damage (no save) until it spends a standard action to dance maniacally.
Dancing ends all such ongoing damage, even if the target has been hit
multiple times with this effect.</p>
<p><em>6:</em> Pacifism. The target can’t attack until the end of the
pixie’s next turn.</p>
<p><em>Dazzling lights:</em> During battle, pixies fill the air with the
light and sound of countless flashy illusions. The effects are
disorienting enough that the PCs don’t get to add the escalation die to
their attacks.</p>
<p><em>Flight:</em> Pixies make flying look like a lot of fun.</p>
<p><em>Invisibility:</em> When an enemy attacks a pixie and misses, the
pixie turns invisible until the start of its next turn (even if it makes
opportunity attacks). A pixie can also turn invisible as a standard
action, in which case the invisibility still lasts until the start of
its next turn.</p></td>

<p><em>Magical concealment:</em> As long as one or more of its podlings
are nearby, the pixie pod is invisible and extremely difficult to even
detect. A PC who wants to locate the pixie-pod must spend a standard
action searching and succeed at a DC 25 skill check using Wisdom.
Backgrounds connected to plants and the wilderness help normally, and
general searching skills and magic talents might help a bit but not at
full strength. Once located, the plant can be attacked like a normal
invisible creature. When it teleports, however, it must be located all
over again.</p>

five active podlings that don’t count toward the total when building a

### Rakshasa

<u>Nastier Special for all rakshasas</u>

*Lockheart:* The first time a rakshasa is dropped to 0 hit points, it  
dies but will definitely be reborn, even if the PCs attempt to use an  
icon die result to prevent the resurrection. A PC who scores a critical  
hit against the rakshasa can attempt to nullify *lockheart* by choosing  
to ignore all other effects of the critical hit (all damage, not just  
the doubling) and attempting a normal save. If the save succeeds,  
*lockheart* is ignored this battle. If the save fails, *lockheart* is  
still in effect. A rakshasa can only use *lockheart* once in its  
lifetime.

Alternatively, instead of rolling saves, the PCs could go on a quest to  
find the lockheart’s key before confronting the rakshasa! That’s a story  
angle you get to manipulate as you choose.

*Backwards palms:* When staggered, the rakshasa’s hands shapeshift so  
that its palms trade places with the backs of its hands. It not only  
looks extremely weird, it also presents the player characters with an  
odd choice: The next time the escalation die would advance, the PCs have  
to choose whether the escalation die will decrease by 1 (minimum 0) or  
whether this rakshasa gets to use the escalation die until the end of  
the battle. If the PC group is split, the decision goes to the character  
with the highest initiative.

half that creature’s maximum hit points.</p></td>

### Redcap

All redcaps have special abilities based on *The Bad Word*. Before every  
battle against redcaps, the GM should determine the *bad word* for that  
battle. Whenever a PC or a player at the table says the word, every  
redcap in the battle can use their associated ability as a free action  
that interrupts whatever action is currently happening.

### Salamander

<u>Abilities for All Salamanders</u>

*Escalating inferno:* If the salamander is in an area with flames, lava,  
or that it has set on fire, it gets to use the escalation die, adding it  
to its attack rolls. Even when not fighting in such an environment, a  
salamander attacked with a spell or attack that deals fire damage gets  
to use the escalation die until the end of its next turn, or longer if  
it’s a powerful or lingering spell. Avoid casting fireball in battle  
with a salamander!

*Resist fire 16+:* Fire attacks against the salamander must roll a  
natural 16+ attack roll or the attack does half damage. Whether or not  
such an attack hits, see escalating inferno!

<u>Nastier Special</u>

*Heat metal:* Enemies who make a melee attack with a non-magical weapon  
against a salamander and who roll a natural 1 or 3 take ongoing fire  
damage equal to twice the salamander’s level unless they drop their  
weapon as a free action.

### Specter

<u>Nastier Specials for all specters</u>

*Aura of loss:* The first time during a battle the specter is staggered,  
each nearby enemy with 30 hp or fewer is hampered until the end of the  
specter’s next turn. (9<sup>th</sup> level dread specter affects enemies  
with 60 hp or fewer.)

*Healing drain:* When an enemy engaged with a specter heals, it heals  
only half the normal hit points, and the specter heals the other half  
(round down).

*Spectral evasion:* Once per battle as a free action when an enemy  
attacks the specter, it can force the attacker to reroll the attack and  
use the result the specter prefers.

### Star-Masks

<u>Champion Tier: Star-Masks & Cultists</u>

To change things up, here are some additional nastier-special abilities  
to give to the star-mask cultists and puppets the PCs face. The  
abilities key off who the star-mask cultist was before they were taken  
by the mask.

<u>Dwarf (or maybe Half-Orc)</u>

*\[Group ability\] Stronger than stone:* Once per battle, a staggered  
dwarf heals to full health as a free action. No matter how many dwarves  
there are in the battle, only one can use this ability.

<u>Elf (or maybe Halfling)</u>

*\[Group ability\] Elf-like grace:* Once per battle, an elf can take a  
second standard action during its turn. No matter how many elves there  
are in the battle, only one can use this ability.

<u>Human (or maybe Half Orc)</u>

*\[Group ability\] Sudden cunning:* Once per battle, a human can turn  
one of its missed attacks into a hit, or a hit into a critical hit. No  
matter how many humans there are in the battle, only one can use this  
ability.

<u>Halfling or Gnome (or maybe Elf)</u>

*\[Group ability\] Quicker than that:* Once per battle, a halfling or  
gnome can turn a hit against it into a miss, or can ignore the miss  
effects of an attack against it. No matter how many halflings or gnomes  
there are in the battle, only one can use this ability.

<u>Epic Tier: Star-Mask Brains</u>

The epic tier star-mask creatures are all star-mask brains. Star mask  
brains warp the reality around them, creating odd effects that can  
surprise the unwary

<u>Star-Mask Brain Effects</u>

At the start of each round in a battle with one or more star-mask  
brains, roll a d10 to see what happens. Some effects are immediate,  
others last the entire round:

**1. Consumption.** One brain can consume any lower-level xombie,  
star-mask, or brain ally to heal back to half hit points if it’s  
staggered, or to full health if not staggered. If there are no allies  
present, 1d4 xombies or cultists show up (note, they may be too low  
level to have any effect except to be swiftly eliminated by the PCs or  
consumed in a later round).

**2. De-escalating illusion.** The star-mask brain blasts the minds of  
the adventurers with illusions—the escalation die decreases by 1 (to a  
minimum of 0).

**3. Delusions.** The star-mask brain messes with the adventurers’  
perceptions. Once this round as a free action, the brain can roll a save  
to avoid a ranged attack that hits it. If it succeeds, the attack misses  
instead. If it rolls 16+ on the save, the attack is redirected and  
automatically hits a nearby enemy other than the attacker of the brain’s  
choice.

**4. Mental empowerment.** Each star-mask brain or cultist in the battle  
gains a +2 bonus to saves and MD this round.

**5. Intrusive thoughts.** The star-mask brain is thinking hard about  
the characters—each PC takes 2d12 psychic damage.

**6. Magical flux.** When the PCs use spell attacks or other magic  
attacks, they must roll twice and use the lower result.

**7. Magical reflux.** When a PC casts a spell this round, they take  
2d20 force damage.

**8. Matter warp.** Everything shudders and twists for a moment, and  
each engaged creature pops free from engagement.

**9. Possession.** The hive mind possesses a PC, who is automatically  
confused until the end of their next turn. Each adventurer can be  
confused only once per battle from this effect.

**10. Steal the momentum.** The star-mask hive mind temporarily steals  
the escalation die; this round, so the monsters get the benefit of the  
die and the adventurers don’t.

#### Star-Mask Host Template

Star-mask cultists can range from those who are simple followers who are  
unaware of the cult’s true purpose, to fully controlled puppets, to  
individuals who welcome their star-mask “partners.”

A star-mask brute normally begins life as a large beast or a dragon, but  
becomes host to dozens of star-masks. The star-masks warp and mutate  
their host, and eventually it is no longer recognizable.

To convert a regular monster or NPC to a star-mask host, give it a  
couple abilities from those listed under psychic powers, physical  
warping, and tentacles. In addition, increase its attack bonus by +4.  
The base creature’s level increases by 1 for purposes of building  
battles.

<u>Psychic Powers</u>

The star-mask hosts have psychic powers granted to them by their  
symbiotic masks. Such hosts usually have some outward sign of their  
powers—swollen skulls or throbbing veins.

<u>Choose one or more of the following:</u>

**C: Dysthymic ray +5 + level vs. MD (one nearby enemy)**—10 psychic  
damage (champion: 20 damage; epic: 30 damage)

*Natural 18+:* The target is confused (save ends) and any confusion  
effect from the ray on a previous target ends.

*Quick use:* 1/round, as a quick action.

*Group mind:* Provided there is a star-mask brain around (it doesn’t  
have to be in the fight, just in the general vicinity), the host gains a  
+4 bonus to MD and knows everything that the star-mask brain knows (and  
vise-versa). If there isn’t a star-mask brain in the area, the host only  
gains a +1 bonus to MD.

*Healed by the hive mind:* Once per battle as a standard action, the  
host heals 25% of its maximum hit points, as does one of its nearby  
allies.

*Hive mind puppet:* When an enemy drops to 0 hp or below, it must roll a  
save. If it fails, it’s “turned” to the star-masks’ side. A turned  
creature recovers during its next turn with temporary hp equal to its  
normal maximum hit points, but it’s now an ally of the star-masks (hard  
save ends, 16+). Once that creature saves and breaks free, it must roll  
a normal save. If it fails, it loses the temporary hit points.

**R: Psychic chains +5 + level vs. MD**—5 ongoing psychic damage  
(champion: 10 ongoing damage, epic: 20 ongoing damage)

*Aftereffect:* When the target saves against the ongoing damage, if the  
save was a natural odd roll, the target becomes confused until it hits  
an ally with an attack.

*Limited use:* 1/battle.

*Psychic illusion:* The host looks normal. It requires a DC 30 skill  
check to notice things like tentacles or bulging muscles on it. If a  
creature’s MD is 17 or less, it won’t even notice the mask itself.

*Telekinetic flight:* The host can fly. When an enemy misses the host  
with an attack and rolls a natural 1–5, it pops free from that enemy.

**C: Woe betide you +5 + level vs. MD (one nearby enemy)**—10 psychic  
damage (champion: 20 damage; epic: 35 damage), and the target can’t heal  
using a recovery (save ends)

*Limited use:* 1/battle.

<u>Physical Enhancements</u>

The star-mask host has been physically enhanced by the star-mask.  
Hunched and twisted forms or skin split open over bulging red muscles  
are common side effects. The greater the physical enhancements the more  
brutish and less intelligent the host becomes (and the easier for the  
star-mask to influence).

<u>Choose one or more of the following:</u>

*Amazing endurance:* The host gains +2 AC and +1 PD, or double that  
bonus while it is defending a star-mask brain.

*Leap:* Once per battle when the escalation die is even, the host can  
pop free from all enemies and leap somewhere nearby or far away as a  
move action. If the host engages an enemy with this movement and  
attacks, it gains a +1 bonus to that attack.

*Trampling charge:* As a standard action, the host moves through an  
enemy’s space without taking an opportunity attack and finishes its move  
out of engagement, making the following attack against that enemy.

**Trample +5 + level vs. AC**—10 damage (champion: 20 damage; epic: 40  
damage)

*Natural even miss:* Half damage.

*Natural even hit:* The target pops free from the host and is hurled far  
away from the host.

<u>Tentacles</u>

The star-mask grips to its host with tentacles, but this star-mask has  
gone further than that.

<u>Choose one or more of the following:</u>

*Barbed tentacles:* Enemies that pop free of the host or move away from  
it without first disengaging take 10 damage.

*Climbing tentacles:* The host can climb up walls and across ceilings as  
easily as it moves on the ground.

*Grasping tentacles:* Enemies engaged with the host must roll twice for  
disengage checks and take the lowest result.

*Tentacles everywhere:* If the star-mask host is intercepted, it can  
make a *probing tentacles* attack as a free action.

**C: Probing tentacles +5 + level vs. PD (an enemy intercepting  
it)**—The enemy becomes stuck and takes 5 ongoing poison damage (save  
ends both) (champion: 10 ongoing damage; epic: 20 ongoing damage)

*Target dies while still stuck:* If a creature dies while stuck in the  
tentacles, the host lays 1d4 star-mask eggs in it, which hatch into  
scuttling star-masks after 1d3 – 1 rounds (0 rounds mean the eggs hatch  
almost instantly).

**R: Whipping tentacles +5 + level vs. AC**—10 damage (champion: 20  
damage; epic: 35 damage)

*Quick use:* 1/round, as a quick action.

### Taranar

<u>Special Abilities for All Taranar</u>

*All-rock (resist weapons and negative energy 16+):* All taranar are  
resistant to physical damage as a result of their stony nature. If an  
assailant fails to make a natural roll of 16+ when using a weapon  
against a taranar, the attacker deals only half damage. The resistance  
also applies to negative energy damage, which tends to fizzle  
ineffectively against the ancient stones.

*Lightning-flare:* As a last ditch defense, when a taranar is reduced to  
between 1 and 10 hp, it can discharge its remaining stored energy as a  
counterattack (no attack roll required) against the character who  
delivered the telling blow, dealing 1d6 lightning damage per level of  
the taranar. The taranar immediately returns to its immobile rock form  
and cannot take any further role in the battle. It will then remain  
torpid unless destroyed or the cycle turns full circle and the  
conditions for it to wake are met again (providing they can be). Such  
severely damaged creatures reawaken as broken taranar, regardless of  
what they were before.

*Thick-skinned:* Being made of stone has its benefits. The taranar are  
immune to almost all effects—they cannot be dazed, weakened, confused,  
or made vulnerable to anything beyond those energies they are already  
vulnerable to (fire and cold; see below). Taranar are also immune to  
ongoing damage.

<u>Cracking Up</u>

Taranar are big and tough. But even big, tough creatures have a weakness  
(or, at least, you really have to hope they do if you don’t want to get  
squashed). For the stone people, their two main fears are fire and ice.  
This may stem from their clashes with their ancient foes the frost and  
fire giants, or it may be due to the actions of those who, over the  
centuries, have used heat and cold to smash their bodies into manageable  
fragments.

As a result, the taranar are vulnerable to fire and cold energy, both of  
which play havoc with their physiology—so much so that a hit from a fire  
attack followed immediately (either in the current or subsequent round)  
by a hit from a cold attack will cause double cold damage, irrespective  
of whether a critical (normally 18+) has been rolled. If a critical is  
rolled, triple the damage inflicted.

<u>Iconic Powers</u>

Centuries of existence as free-standing monoliths have exposed the  
taranar to many of the world’s most powerful magical traditions. There’s  
something about a circle or avenue of standing stones that inspires  
druids, cultists, chaos magicians, and wizards to get a ritual going.

Part of the taranar’s remarkable success at hiding through the ages  
comes from the fact that they don’t wake up just because someone is  
using their stone as an altar for a goblin sacrifice or a ritual of  
rebirth. But sleeping through centuries of ritual magic doesn’t mean  
that the taranar have been unaffected by the experience. It’s possible  
that a taranar could have acquired lingering magical abilities.

You can use the following special abilities in at least five ways:

1: As a consequence of a story connection between a taranar and its  
location in the world, obviously exposed for a long period of time to  
magicians associated with an icon.

2: As a reaction to a PC’s use of an icon advantage, particularly as a  
possible complication of an icon advantage used when the taranar are in  
play or in the story.

3: To cast the taranar as heroes or villains relative to the player  
characters’ intentions.

4: As lower impact nastier specials in battles that seem overly easy on  
the PCs.

5: In combination with each other, since it’s entirely possible that the  
magic of more than one icon has shaped a stone!

**Magic Icon (The Flying Stones):** In sympathy with the magic that  
keeps the Magic Icon city aloft, a taranar influenced by the Magic  
Icon’s magic can fly until the end of a battle after it has either  
scored or suffered a critical hit. The flight isn’t quick or agile. More  
like empowered levitation, about what you’d expect from an airborne  
monolith.

**Demonic Icon (The Stones are Red):** Roll a random demon ability. The  
taranar will use that ability once this battle, and once only.

**Graceful Icon (Repose):** Roll a normal save when dropped to 0 hit  
points. If the save succeeds, the taranar only drops to 1 hit point and  
teleports somewhere far away to sleep for a while. And then it wakes up.  
And remembers everything…

**Nature Icon (The Call):** The first time the escalation die reaches  
5+, another taranar surfaces in the battle, called up from hidden  
slumber.

**Undead Icon (Simple Fear):** The taranar has the *fear* ability,  
affecting creatures at or beneath the fear threshold for its level  
indicated on the DIY monster tables.

**Brute Icon (Savagery):** −2 to all defenses. +2 to all attacks.

**Draconic Icon (Fight the Claw):** Taranar are usually enemies of the  
dragons. Exposure to their magic has taught the taranar to use the  
escalation die whenever it is odd.

<td><p>Initiative: +20</p>
<p><u>Creature of Legend</u></p>
<p>The tarrasque can make one close attack and one melee attack each
round as a standard action. Note that flying is usually no defense
against the tarrasque, which is huge and powerful enough to pluck or
whack enemies out of the sky with surprising leaps.</p>
<p><strong>All-enveloping toothy maw +19 vs. AC</strong>—155 damage</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit:</em> The tarrasque grabs the target. It will
swallow a grabbed enemy in 1d3 rounds (see <em>swallow whole</em>).</p>
<p><em>Natural 16+:</em> The tarrasque swallows the target immediately
(see <em>swallow whole</em>).</p>
<p><strong>Immense spike, horn, or tusk +18 vs. AC</strong>—155
damage</p>
<p><em>Natural 16+:</em> The target takes 9d6 extra damage and pops free
from the tarrasque as it’s hurled faraway.</p>
<p><strong>C: Earth-shaking, taloned claw +20 vs. AC (each nearby enemy
in a group)</strong>—155 damage</p>
<p><em>Natural 16+:</em> The target is stunned (save ends).</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> The target is dazed (save ends).</p>
<p><strong>C: Cataclysmic tail slam +18 vs. PD (each nearby enemy in a
group)</strong>—170 damage</p>
<p><em>Natural 16+:</em> The target is vulnerable (save ends).</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> The target is dazed until the end of its next
turn.</p>
<p><em>Amphibious:</em> The tarrasque can swim and breathe underwater
(or it holds so much air in its vast lungs that it makes no
difference).</p>
<p><em>Enormously bulky:</em> The tarrasque is so huge that it ignores
opportunity attacks. In addition, normal-sized enemies are like fleas to
it, and disengaging from the tarrasque requires only an easy save (6+),
unless the target is grabbed.</p>
<p><em>Immortal:</em> The tarrasque can’t be killed, save by the
explicit will of a god (and not some jumped-up local god, either) or,
perhaps, the sacrifice of a great icon. The tarrasque’s HP total
indicates the amount of damage required to make it disgorge swallowed
enemies and flee to go hibernate while it regenerates the damage it
suffered and decide if it wants to rampage again.</p>
<p><em>Inflexible:</em> The tarrasque can’t easily fight foes that get
onto its back, and may not even notice them if they aren’t attacking it.
When it does tire of a passenger, it can either use its <em>tail
slam</em> attack (–2 attack penalty: on a hit, the target only takes
half damage and is knocked off the tarrasque [possibly falling damage];
on a miss, the target takes no damage) or a <em>drag</em> attack as a
standard action, crushing the rider between its shell and a mountainside
or other high, hard obstacle.</p>
<p><strong>Drag +21 vs. PD (each creature on its back)</strong>—130
damage, the target pops free of the tarrasque, and the target is
hampered (save ends)</p>
<p><em>Legendary resistance:</em> The tarrasque is immune to normal
conditions and effects (stunned, weakened, etc.), but it isn’t
completely impervious. Bypassing its resistances requires icon-supported
effort. A PC can use one 5 or 6 they acquired from icon relationship
dice rolls to overcome the resistance each time they use an attack or
power that would apply a condition or effect upon the tarrasque. Of
course, they must also provide a story to go along with the reason the
tarrasque is affected.</p>
<p><em>Leveler:</em> When the escalation die is even, as a move action
the tarrasque can demolish any ordinary structure it can reach, such as
a house, castle wall, temple, or ship. The beast automatically reduces
the structure to rubble, rendering it useless. Each creature on top of
or within the structure is subject to a <em>collapse</em> attack.</p>
<p><strong>Collapse +18 vs. PD (each creature in/on the
structure)</strong>—90 damage, and the target is stuck and takes 20
ongoing damage (hard save ends both, 16+)</p>
<p><em>Swallow whole:</em> Once a creature is swallowed, it goes inside
one of the tarrasque’s gigantic stomachs. It can still act while inside
the tarrasque, but it will have to deal with the beast’s stomach acid
that is splashing around. A swallowed creature must deal 400 damage to
the tarrasque to force it to disgorge the contents of its gullet,
freeing the creature. During the tarrasque’s turn, it can make a
<em>gullet digestion</em> attack against the target as a free
action.</p>
<p><strong>Gullet digestion +19 vs. PD</strong>—80 acid damage, and 20
ongoing acid damage</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> 5d12 acid damage.</p>
<p><em>Soft-ish innerbelly:</em> The tarrasque doesn’t have scales on
the inside. It takes a –5 penalty to all defenses against attacks from
inside its gullet, though only melee and close attacks can be made in
there. The tarrasque’s insides are immune to acid damage, however.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p><em>Fear:</em> While engaged with the tarrasque, enemies that have
216 hp or fewer are dazed (–4 attack) and do not add the escalation die
to their attacks.</p>
<p><em>Regeneration 230:</em> While a tarrasque is damaged, its malign
magical flesh heals 230 hit points at the start of the tarrasque’s turn.
It can regenerate five times per battle. If it heals up to its maximum
hit points, then that use of <em>regeneration</em> doesn’t count against
the five-use limit. With this power, the monstrosity is likely
unstoppable without a powerful magical artifact designed specifically to
bind, wound, or otherwise hamper the tarrasque.</p></td>

### Treant

All treants except awakened tress have the *demolish* ability.

*Free-form ability—Demolish:* Given time, treants are capable of pulling  
apart just about anything that’s been put together. Their roots squeeze  
into spaces between paving stones, slowly pulling them up and out of  
place. Their branches can likewise worm their way into spaces in walls,  
doors, and gates, and with steady pressure they can pull down most  
human-made structures. This slow-motion destruction takes minutes for  
the simplest efforts and hours for major demolition.

### Troglodyte

<u>For all troglodytes</u>

*Trog stench:* Trogs spray scents that stink so badly that other  
humanoids take penalties to all attacks, defenses, and saves when  
engaged with a troglodyte or when nearby three or more troglodytes.  
Non-humanoids aren’t affected.

Humanoids affected by *trog stench* can make a normal save (with a  
penalty) at the end of each of their turns. If the save succeeds, the  
humanoid can ignore all *trog stench* for the rest of the battle.

*Trog stench* penalties vary for different humanoid races:

| Race                                                      | Save Penalty |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| Elves, gnolls, gnomes                                     | -4           |
| Humans, halflings, half-elves, holy ones, tieflings, etc. | -3           |
| Half-orcs, dragonics                                      | -2           |
| Dwarves                                                   | -1           |

### Warbanner

Warbanners have a number of abilities in common. The feral warbanner has
the full version of these abilities. You may customize the feral
warbanner by giving it icon-associated abilities.

A warbanner generally commands large groups of mooks that are simple to
play. Creatures in a warbanner’s band are allies fully under its
control. It could also have allies not in its band.

lower result of your choice) to determine one effect</p>
<p><em>1–5:</em> The warbanner’s bearer can make a basic attack with a
+2 attack bonus as a free action.</p>
<p><em>6–10:</em> Each different enemy engaged with a creature in the
warbanner’s band takes 1d6 psychic damage.</p>
<p><em>11–15:</em> If any mooks in the warbanner’s band have dropped
this battle, return one of those mooks to the battle next to the
warbanner. (If the warbanner has no mooks in its band, choose a lower
result.)</p>
<p><em>16–20:</em> The warbanner can make a <em>false rally</em> attack
as a free action.</p>
<p><em>[Special trigger]</em> <strong>C: False rally +7 vs. MD (one
nearby enemy with 12 hp or fewer)</strong>—The target is confused (hard
save ends, 16+)</p>
<p><em>Critical hit:</em> The target can now only save against the
confusion with a natural 20 (or until the warbanner drops) and can’t
flee if the rest of the PCs choose to do so.</p>
<p><em>Designated bearer:</em> Once per round as a quick action, the
warbanner can fly directly above a lower-level ally in its band and
designate that ally as its bearer. Alternately, it can release itself
from a bearer and fly free.</p>
<p><em>Bearer beware:</em> While the warbanner has a bearer it moves
with the bearer and is engaged by enemies that engage the bearer. The
bearer is vulnerable to all attacks but it can use the escalation
die.</p>
<p><em>Conditional resist damage 16+:</em> Unless an ally in the
warbanner’s band dropped to 0 hp since the start of the current round,
an enemy attacking the warbanner must roll a natural 16+ on the attack
roll or it only takes half damage. This ability has no effect if the
warbanner has no allies in its band.</p>
<p><em>Flight:</em> Warbanners fly quickly, fluttering in winds only
they can feel, preferably never touching the ground. They can’t fly off
the ground higher than a flag on a pole can be carried into battle, so
enemies on the ground can still target them. At best, a warbanner might
gain a +2 bonus to defenses against attacks made by small PCs like
halflings and gnomes.</p>
<p><em>Mook morale:</em> Mooks fighting in the warbanner’s band gain a
bonus to their hit points equal to the warbanner’s level (2).</p></td>

### Werebeasts

Each werebeast can take one of three forms as a quick action once per
round: a humanoid form, a beast form, or a hybrid form that combines the
two. The hybrid form is the most powerful in combat, but the humanoid
and beast forms are useful for various activities outside of combat as
well.

The stats below work for the beast and hybrid forms. If a werebeast ends
up fighting in humanoid form, subtract 2 from all its defenses and halve
its normal attack damage.

The following powers are common for werebeasts.

*Beast heart (all three forms):* Animals of the werebeast’s type are
intuitively on good terms with the were, even dire animals. If the
werebeast betrays them, however, retaliation is certain and merciless.

*Cursed bite (hybrid or animal form only):* While the moon is full, the
first time each battle a creature takes damage from a werebeast melee
attack, it takes 10 extra damage (champion: 20 damage; epic: 40 damage).
The malignant curse, transmitted through the attack, shocks the mortal
flesh. Further attacks, even from weres of different types, don’t cause
extra damage. Unless blessed, purged, or otherwise cured, the damaged
creature will turn into a werebeast on the night of the next full moon.
Heroes powerful enough to fight werebeasts can usually find benefactors
or rituals to cure them, but there’s an exception to every rule. GM, if
you’re unsure whether it’s a full moon, roll a d10. On a 1–3, the moon
is full enough.

*Resilient shifting (all three forms):* As mentioned above, a werebeast
can shift forms once per round as a quick action. When a werebeast
shifts, it can roll a save against one save ends effect.

<u>Nastier Specials for all werebeasts</u>

The following ability is extremely nasty when combined with the *bestial
fury* most werebeasts have. It’s possibly better used as a story option,
a consequence of a problem with a skill check or an icon relationship,
or a situation that should have been avoided and may require sacrifices
to deal with:

*Moon fury (hybrid form only):* While fighting in moonlight, a werebeast
gains a bonus to damage equal to its level (champion: double its level;
epic: triple it).

<p><strong>C: Whispered secrets +10 vs. MD (1d3 nearby
enemies)</strong>—5 psychic damage, and the target’s mind is filled with
a delusional scene from its past that depends on the roll</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit:</em> The target is confused until the end of
its next turn as it sees a foe from its past.</p>
<p><em>Natural odd hit:</em> The target is weakened until the end of its
next turn as it remembers a past failure.</p>
<p><em>Rewards of the patron:</em> So long as the attack hits one or
more targets, one ally of the prophet’s choice gains a cumulative +1
attack bonus until the end of the battle that increases that ally’s
natural attack roll (so a roll of natural 15 becomes a roll of natural
16 with a +1 bonus, or a natural 17 with a +2 bonus, etc.). The ally can
choose not to use the bonus.</p>
<p><em>Saw it coming:</em> Twice per battle as a free action, the
prophet can try to avoid a non-critical attack that hits it. The
attacker must reroll the attack roll with a –4 penalty.</p>
<p><em>Knows the angles:</em> Twice per battle as a move action, the
prophet can teleport to anywhere it can see, or to a location it can’t
see but that has the correct geometry and that it has previously
prepared (a lair).</p>

<p><em>Haruspicy master:</em> When an enemy has dropped to 0 hp or lower
since the prophet’s last turn, as a quick action it can get a glimpse of
the near-future. It grants 1d3 nearby allies a +4 bonus to attacks and
to all defenses until the start of its next turn.</p>
<p><em>A special secret:</em> When the prophet makes a <em>whispered
secrets</em> attack, it can choose to target only one nearby enemy. If
it does, it gains a +4 attack bonus against that enemy and the hit
effects are save ends.</p></td>

### Xorn

<u>Abilities for All Xorn</u>

All xorn have the following abilities:

*Rock swimming:* As a move action the xorn can swim through the ground,
or through a wall.

*360 degree vision:* The xorn can’t be surprised, and rogues can’t use
their Sneak Attack class feature on them.

*Penetrating vision:* The xorn can see through all types of rock and
soil for some distance, let’s say “nearby”.

*Resist cold and fire 16+:* Xorn are used to the fires of the deep and
the cold of solid rock—when a cold or fire attack targets a xorn, the
attacker must roll a natural 16+ on the attack roll or it only deals
half damage.
