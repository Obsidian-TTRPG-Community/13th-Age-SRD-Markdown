<p><strong>Scraggly fist +11 vs. AC</strong>—15 damage</p>
<p><em>Limited use:</em> Only usable when the spriggan is at its normal
size; but still usable if hampered!</p>
<p><strong>R: Fairy lights +11 vs. MD (1d3 nearby enemies in a
group)</strong>—20 damage</p>
<p><em>Natural 18+:</em> The target is dazed (save ends).</p>
<p><em>Limited use:</em> Once per battle, with an additional use for
each critical hit scored by the spriggan’s enemies this battle.</p>
<p><strong>Giant-sized slap +11 vs. PD (each enemy engaged with it, OR
one enemy engaged with it and one nearby enemy)</strong>—17 damage</p>
<p><em>Natural odd hit:</em> The target is thrown somewhere faraway but
non-harmful (like over a cliff) and loses its next move action.</p>
<p><em>Natural 1–3:</em> The target can make an opportunity attack
against the spriggan.</p>
<p><em>Limited use:</em> Only usable when the spriggan is at its larger
size.</p>
<p><em>Hidden guardian:</em> If a spriggan wants to stay hidden in an
illusory form instead of joining a battle, roll initiative for the
spriggan as normal. When the spriggan “acts,” by doing nothing, have the
most perceptive PC roll a DC 25 Wisdom check, adding +1 for each of
their allies in the fight. On a success, the spriggan’s illusion is
pierced and the spriggan can use a single move action during its turn,
but nothing else—it burned its standard action trying to stay
hidden.</p>
<p><em>Embiggen:</em> When the escalation die reaches 2, the spriggan
grows in size as a free action, acquiring its <em>giant-sized slap</em>
attack. Note that as a free action, this transformation can take place
any time, usually at the start of a round. If the spriggan was using its
<em>hidden guardian</em> ability, it’s not hidden anymore!</p></td>
