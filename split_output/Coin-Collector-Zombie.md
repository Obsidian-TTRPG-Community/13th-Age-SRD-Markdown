there’s a convenient hole) heals 3d6 hit points. It normally doesn’t
spend its time this way in combat, but who can predict collectors?</p>

## Couatl

In addition to their standard abilities, all elder couatls and some  
8<sup>th</sup> level couatls have another ability or attack—sometimes  
even two—that flows from the power of the icon or icons they are  
presently associated with. Memory keeper couatls who are associated with  
icons that no longer exist should be given whichever ability or attack  
that seems right. Alternatively, make up a new ability/attack that suits  
the former icon you’ve created.

Here are some Icon-centered abilities:

<p>Secretly roll a d6 at the start of each battle. If the roll is odd,
the PCs can’t use any of their magic items’ powers when the escalation
die is odd this battle. If the roll is even, the PCs can’t use their
magic items’ powers when the escalation die is even this battle. Default
chakra bonuses still function, but powers don’t. And for the fun of it,
once they’ve been powered off for a turn, all the PCs’ magic items will
be freaking out and creating roleplaying havoc by forcing their quirks
to the forefront for the rest of the battle.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Graceful Icon</p>
<p>At the start of each battle, the couatl gains 1d4 powers of its
choice from this list:</p>
<p><em>Cruel:</em> Once per battle, deal ongoing damage to a target you
hit with a natural even attack roll as a free action. The ongoing damage
equals 5 times your level. As usual, a normal save (11+) ends the
damage. A critical hit doesn’t double this ongoing damage.</p>
<p><em>Highblood Teleport:</em> Once per battle as a move action, place
yourself in a nearby location you can see.</p>
<p><em>Elven Grace:</em> At the start of each of your turns, roll a die
to see if you get an extra standard action. If your roll is equal to or
lower than the escalation die, you get an extra standard action that
turn. At the start of battle, you roll a d6. Each time you successfully
gain an extra action, the size of the die you roll increases by one step
on the following progression: (d4), d6, d8, d10, d12, d20. If you get an
extra action after rolling a d20, you can’t get any more extra actions
that battle.</p>
<p><em>Surprising:</em> Once per battle, subtract one from the natural
result of one of your own d20 rolls.</p></td>

once per battle.</p>
