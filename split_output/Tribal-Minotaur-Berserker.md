escaped one), and gains +1 to its attacks against armed enemies (but not
against magic-users).</p></td>

<p>Wrecker</p>

<td><p>Initiative: +9</p>
<p>Vulnerability: fire</p>
<p><strong>Unholy grasp +11 vs. PD</strong>—40 ongoing negative energy
damage and the target is affected by <em>mummy rot</em> (save ends
both)</p>
<p><em>Each failed save (mummy rot):</em> The target’s flesh begins to
rot and the ongoing damage increases by +40 (cumulative). Saves granted
by special powers don’t increase this damage if they fail, only end of
turn failures.</p>
<p><em>Natural 16+:</em> The target also takes 20 damage.</p>
<p><strong>C: Sepulchral glare +11 vs. MD (one nearby
enemy)</strong>—The target is hampered until the start of the mummy’s
next turn</p>
<p><em>Crit:</em> If the target is already affected by <em>mummy
rot</em>, increase the ongoing negative energy damage by 40. If the
target isn’t affected by <em>mummy rot</em> already, it takes 40 ongoing
negative energy damage and is affected by <em>mummy rot</em> (save ends
both).</p>
<p><em>Limited use:</em> 1/round, as a quick action.</p>
<p><em>Mortal terror:</em> The presence of a mummy unnerves opponents,
giving it an unusual <em>fear aura</em>. While engaged with this
creature, enemies that have 200 hp or fewer are dazed (–4 attack) and do
not add the escalation die to their attacks. Each time an enemy with 200
hp or fewer attacks the mummy, hit or miss, it must roll a save. On a
success, it’s no longer affected by the <em>fear aura</em> effects of
any mummy in the battle.</p>
<p><em>Spiritual grit:</em> When the mummy takes 20 damage or less from
a non-fire attack, it takes no damage instead.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p><em>Blessing of preservation:</em> The mummy has a +4 bonus to all
defenses until it takes damage.</p>
<p><em>Bone-chilling cry:</em> Once per battle as a quick action, the
mummy can issue a bone-chilling cry that seems to echo from some unseen
tomb or portal and it makes a <em>call of the sarcophagus</em>
attack.</p>
<p><strong>C: Call of the sarcophagus +11 vs. MD (each nearby enemy
suffering <em>mummy rot</em>)</strong>—The target is hampered until the
end of its next turn</p></td>

## Naga

<u>Nastier Special for all naga:</u>

Arcane balance: Whenever the naga rolls a natural 1–5 with an attack  
roll, it can cancel one magical effect created by a spell or magic item  
that is affecting the naga or a nearby creature (including beneficial  
effect on a PC). It can be an ongoing effect, an effect that only lasts  
a round, or even an effect that was supposed to last until the end of  
the battle. Use your sense of what is magical and what isn’t: a bard’s  
song is clearly magical, but a rogue’s Shadow Walk talent probably  
isn’t, despite the wizard’s arguments that it *should* be.
