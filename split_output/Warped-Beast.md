<p><em>Natural 18+:</em> The target is confused until the end of its

<p><em>One madness feature:</em> At the start of each of the warped
beast’s turns, roll a d6. The warped beast gains the corresponding
ability until the start of its next turn.</p>
<p><em>1. Amorphous oozing form:</em> The beast has <em>resist damage
11+</em> to all damage.</p>
<p><em>2. Dimensional slide:</em> Once during its turn, the warped beast
can teleport anywhere nearby it can see as a move action. Each enemy
engaged with it when it teleports is confused until the end of its next
turn.</p>
<p><em>3. Fear aura:</em> While engaged with the warped beast, enemies
that have 24 hp or fewer are dazed (–4 attack) and do not add the
escalation die to their attacks.</p>

<em>tentacle maw</em> attack during its turn, roll a d4. That many
additional limbs or tentacles spontaneously erupt from the creature and
make an additional basic attack that turn (special abilities/effects
don’t trigger on those extra attacks). Each of those attacks only deals
half damage.</p>
<p><em>6. Warping touch:</em> When the warped beast hits a creature with
a <em>tentacle maw</em> attack, the target also takes 5 ongoing psychic
damage and a –2 penalty to saves (save ends both).</p>
