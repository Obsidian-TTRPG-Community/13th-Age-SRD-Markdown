<p><em>Champion’s challenge:</em> If the centaur champion scores a crit
against the target, it can challenge that enemy. If it does, until the
end of the battle the champion and the target each take a –4 attack
penalty against any target except the other. If the centaur champion
dies or challenges a new foe, the old challenge is canceled.</p>
<p><strong>Crushing hooves +10 vs. PD (2 attacks)</strong>—13 damage,
and the target is vulnerable until the start of its next turn</p>
<p><em>Hooves and slash:</em> As a standard action, the centaur champion
can make a <em>crushing hooves</em> attack and a single <em>two-handed
sword</em> attack (one attack roll) against the same enemy.</p>
<p><em>Leader of the clan:</em> When the centaur champion engages an
enemy, each other centaur ally engaged with that creature can pop free
from it.</p>
<p><em>Moving combatant:</em> The centaur champion gains a +4 AC bonus
against opportunity attacks and only takes half damage from opportunity
attacks that hit it. When an enemy makes an opportunity attack against
it and misses, that enemy takes 20 damage from a counter-attack.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p><em>Chief’s challenge:</em> When the champion issues a <em>champion’s
challenge</em>, it only takes a –2 attack penalty against other enemies
than its chosen foe, but that enemy still takes the –4 attack penalty.
In addition, the champion can use <em>champion’s challenge</em> as a
free action when it becomes staggered.</p>
<p><em>Champion’s scorn:</em> Each of the champion’s centaur allies in
the battle gains a +5 damage bonus with ranged attacks.</p></td>
