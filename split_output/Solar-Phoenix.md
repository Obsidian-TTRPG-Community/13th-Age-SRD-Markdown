<p><strong>Fly-by talons +17 vs. AC</strong>—140 damage, and 20 ongoing
fire damage (hard save ends, 16+)</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit or miss:</em> The phoenix may move again this
turn as a quick action if it has already made a flying move on its
turn.</p>
<p><em>Miss:</em> The solar phoenix can use a <em>solar wind</em> attack
as a quick action, either this turn, or on its next turn.</p>
<p><em>[Usually special trigger, but also possible as a standard
action]</em> <strong>Solar wind +17 vs. PD (1d4 nearby or faraway
enemies)</strong>—70 fire damage, or 120 fire damage if used as a
standard action.</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit or miss:</em> The solar phoenix teleports to a
point nearby or faraway.</p>
<p><em>Flight:</em> The solar phoenix flies like the sun unleashed.</p>
<p><em>Flaming wings:</em> The solar phoenix deals 20 fire damage to
each enemy that ends it turn engaged with the phoenix.</p>
<p><em>Resist fire 16+:</em> When a fire attack targets this creature,
the attacker must roll a natural 16+ on the attack roll or it only deals
half damage.</p>
<p><em>Spectacular effects:</em> When the solar phoenix is dealt a
critical hit, it must roll an easy save (6+). If the save fails, the
phoenix drops to 0 hit points; see the <em>reborn in fire</em> ability
below!</p>
<p><em>Reborn in fire:</em> Whenever the phoenix drops to 0 hit points,
roll a d20 and add the escalation die. For each time this phoenix has
rolled its <em>reborn in fire</em> ability earlier this battle, subtract
10 from the roll. For example, a phoenix making its second <em>reborn in
fire</em> roll (because its first roll ended up being 20+!) when the
escalation die is 6 would roll the d20 and subtract 4.</p>
<p><strong>20+:</strong> The solar phoenix is immediately reborn,
healing to 400 hit points and keeps fighting!</p>
<p><strong>15–19:</strong> The phoenix is reborn in fire, but vaults
into the overworld, removed from the battle. On the other hand, it’s not
done with the PCs! Add the phoenix to an upcoming battle by surprise,
adding it as an additional monster not accounted for by the usual
encounter-building calculations.</p>
<p><strong>8–14:</strong> The solar phoenix is reborn in fire but wants
nothing more to do with this battle. It makes the following attack, but
when the attack is over it shoots off into the overworld so quickly that
it’s a teleport effect, and does not return to the battle, nor to the
adventure.</p>
<p><strong>Conflagration of rebirth +17 vs. PD (every nearby
enemy)</strong>—90 fire damage</p>
<p><strong>7 or less:</strong> The phoenix flares back to life somewhere
nearby in a few hours, days, months, or years. Probably not relevant to
the PCs unless they or the phoenix bear a special grudge. But who are we
kidding? This is a solar phoenix. It has its own agenda, and the PCs
just got onto the agenda, one way or another.</p></td>

## Pixie

All pixies have the *glamour* ability.

*Glamour*: Outside of combat, pixies can create complex illusions at  
will. For the PC, it’s usually a normal or hard skill check to sort out  
what’s real.
