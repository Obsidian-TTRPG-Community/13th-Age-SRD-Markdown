<p><strong>Enormous maul +15 vs. AC</strong>—60 damage</p>
<p><em>Natural even hit or miss:</em> The golem can make a
<em>backswing</em> attack as a free action.</p>
<p><em>[Special trigger]</em> <strong>Backswing +14 vs. PD</strong>—40
damage</p>
<p><em>Golem immunity:</em> Non-organic golems are immune to effects.
They can’t be dazed, weakened, confused, made vulnerable, or touched by
ongoing damage. You can damage a golem, but that’s about it.</p>
<p><u>Special Virtues</u></p>
<p>Each marble golem is infused with <em>two</em> virtues—magical
properties that relate to the emotion or feeling incorporated into the
sculpture as its dominant theme. Choose two virtues from the list below,
or for a unique marble golem, invent your own.</p>
<p><em>Awe (fear effect):</em> While nearby the golem, enemies with 40
hp or fewer are dazed (–4 attack) and do not add the escalation die to
their attacks.</p>
<p><em>Beauty:</em> The first time each enemy attacks the marble golem
this battle, it must roll a normal save; on a failure, the attack takes
a –6 penalty.</p>
<p><em>Courage:</em> While staggered, the marble golem adds the
escalation die to its attack rolls.</p>
<p><em>Endurance:</em> When the marble golem rolls a natural 1–5 with an
attack roll, it heals 1d10 hit points per point on the escalation die.
(It was checking for damage and got distracted.)</p>
<p><em>Hatred:</em> When an enemy is staggered by the marble golem’s
attack, that enemy takes 4d10 extra damage.</p>
<p><em>Patience:</em> Each turn, the marble golem can use one standard
action to gain a +2 bonus to all defenses until the start of its next
turn. If it does, it gains an extra standard action during its next
turn.</p>
<p><em>Protection:</em> When the marble golem rolls a natural 16+ with
an attack, decrease the escalation die by 1.</p>
<p><em>Strength:</em> The marble golem’s melee attacks now deal half
damage on a miss.</p>
<p><u>Nastier Specials</u></p>
<p><em>More virtues:</em> Statues that capture even more themes make
stronger marble golems. Add one or two more virtues to the
golem.</p></td>
