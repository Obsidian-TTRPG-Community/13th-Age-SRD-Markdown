## Environmental Effects

Before the battle, roll a `dice: 1d4` to determine which environmental effect will show up during the fight. Then roll a `dice: 1d3` for the minimum escalation die value that triggers the effect at the start of the round and stays in effect the rest of the battle.

In the unlikely event that PCs have managed to find or lure briar elves outside the briar elf’s forested places of power, these effects probably wouldn’t apply.

## Humanoid Briar Elves

**1. Snares**—Enemies who take more than two actions on their turn while on the ground must save (11+) or be whipped into mid-air by a snare trap and hung upside-down (stuck & –2 attack penalty), it is a standard action to free oneself or an ally. (GM: Choose how many snares you want set before the fight, probably the number of PCs plus or minus 1.)

**2. Pit traps**—The briar elves have created spike-lined pits disguised with forest-floor litter. If you roll a natural 1–5 on d20 roll you must save (11+) or become stuck (move action to end) and take your level × `dice: d6` damage.

**3. Blowdarts**—More briar elves are lurking on the edge of the fight, just out of sight. If a PC rolls lower than the escalation die value on any natural d20 roll they take poison damage equal to their level.

**4. Gruesome display**—The whirl of battle has revealed some fresh corpses desecrated by the briar elves and impaled in the trees. Story consequences are best here: it can be someone the PCs cared about.

## Undead Briar Elves

**1. Whispers of the past**—PCs have a –2 penalty to MD and PD, as  
overlapping ghostly whispers cause pain and anxiety.

**2. Ghostly terrain**—On rounds when the escalation die is odd the PCs  
are stuck, unable to move due to ghost trees that suddenly block their  
paths.

**3. Spectral hands**—PCs take a –1 penalty to attack rolls, as ghostly  
thorn-pierced hands grab at them.

**4. Fearful destiny**—PCs who could normally resist fear effects cannot  
do so for the duration of this battle. PCs who cannot normally resist  
fear take a –2 penalty to their saves whenever they are affected by  
fear.
