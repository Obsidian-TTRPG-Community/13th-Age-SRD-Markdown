## PC Victories

**First PC campaign victory**: Remove the Fallen Icon’s *natural supremacy* ability.

**Second PC campaign victory**: *Angry sky* only triggers when the
escalation die is even.

**Third PC campaign victory**: Remove the *seeds on the wind* ability.

**Fourth PC campaign victory**: Remove the 60 damage dealt by the
*ambulatory landscape* ability.

### Mook Squads

When *those that walk the forest* is triggered, roll `dice: 1d4+2` for the number of mooks in the mob. Then roll a d6 to determine which mooks join the battle; 
- 1–2: Fanatical druid circle
- 3: Frenzied wolf pack
- 4: Militant ranger squad
- 5: Opportunistic orc band
- 6: Treant avenger.

Remember that starting a battle with these mooks in play makes the Fallen Icon tougher thanks to the defense bonus that’s part of *those that walk the forest*.
