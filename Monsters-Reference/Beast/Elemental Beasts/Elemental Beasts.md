## Making Elemental Beasts

Any creature with the [BEAST] type can become an elemental beast, just follow these guidelines.

The base creature loses whatever resistances and vulnerabilities it had and gains those listed for its elemental affinity. It also gains between one and three elemental abilities for that affinity from the options below.

With just one ability, as well as a new vulnerability and resistance, creatures that become elemental beasts aren’t powerful or changed enough to warrant adjusting their level for purposes of creating encounters. However, you may want to up-level beasts with two or three abilities depending on those abilities and your desired level of difficulty, especially if you’re creating a battle with several elemental beasts.

For balance, simplicity, pacing, and playability, don’t use more than three abilities for an elemental beast.
