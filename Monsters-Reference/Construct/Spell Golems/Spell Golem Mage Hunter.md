traits:
    - name: "Limited golem immunity"
      desc: "A golem warder can’t be dazed, weakened, confused, or made vulnerable. Ongoing damage doesn’t harm it either, unless it’s acid, fire, or lightning."
    - name: "Spell deflection"
      desc: "When a spell attack targets the mage hunter, roll a d20. On a 1–7, the attack or effect hits normally. On an 8–15, the attack or effect is negated. On a 16+, the attack or effect is reflected back at the caster as if that enemy had been targeted instead of the golem (so it must overcome defenses and resistances, as normal)."
nastier_traits:
    - name: "Made of tougher stuff"
      desc: "Instead of wood, stronger materials were used to create the golem, such as crystal or brass. This golem is non-organic and has golem immunity (so ongoing acid, fire, and lightning don’t harm it)."
