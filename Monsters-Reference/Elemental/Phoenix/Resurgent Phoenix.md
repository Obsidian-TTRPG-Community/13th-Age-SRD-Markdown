      desc: "Whenever the phoenix drops to 0 hit points, roll a d20 and add the escalation die. For each time this phoenix has rolled its _reborn in fire_ ability earlier this battle, subtract 10 from the roll. For example, a phoenix making its second _reborn in fire_ roll (because its first roll ended up being 20+!) when the escalation die is 6 would roll the d20 and subtract 4."

      desc: "The phoenix is reborn in fire, but vaults into the overworld, removed from the battle. On the other hand, it’s not done with the PCs! Add the phoenix to an upcoming battle by surprise, adding it as an additional monster not accounted for by the usual encounter-building calculations."
    - name: "8–14"
      desc: "The resurgent phoenix is reborn in fire but wants nothing more to do with this battle. It makes the following attack, but when the attack is over it shoots off into the overworld so quickly that it’s a teleport effect, and does not return to the battle, nor to the adventure."
    - name: "7 or less"
      desc: "The phoenix flares back to life somewhere nearby in a few hours, days, months, or years. Probably not relevant to the PCs unless they or the phoenix bear a special grudge."
