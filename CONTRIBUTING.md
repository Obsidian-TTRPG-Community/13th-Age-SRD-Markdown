# Contributing to the 13th Age SRD Markdown Repository

So, you want to contribute to this repository? Well, welcome aboard! We have a few, very basic rules on what can be added here.

## The Rules

1. You must use content that is legal to be published publically. Just because it is on [www.13thAgeSrd.com](www.13thagesrd.com) it does not mean it actually is legal to be punlished.
2. Homebrew is welcome.
3. We follow a Kebab-Case file naming schema.
4. Folder notes are welcome but not required.
5. Be smart with frontmatter and tags
6. All tables must have a `^13A-table-title` block-id.

Everything else that comes up can be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.

## Contributing Basics

1. Use the Forks. I.e, fork a repo and submit a PR.
2. Try to rebase or squash your commits before the PR.
3. When in doubt, ask.
