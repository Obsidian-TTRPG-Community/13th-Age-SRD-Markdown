> Since humans start with an additional feat at 1st level, add one to the number of adventurer feats humans possess all the way up the chart.

Most of the feats in the game are attached to specific class talents, attacks, and spells.

If a feat is attached to a talent, power, or spell, you **must** have the talent, power, or spell in order to choose the feat.

When there is more than one feat attached to a specific talent or power, you **have** to choose the **lower tier feats** before you pick up the **higher tier feats**.
