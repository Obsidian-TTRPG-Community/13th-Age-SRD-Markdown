# Race
Every character has a race (see **Races**). Pick one for your character. If you want to make a non-standard race for your character, the rules wonâ€™t hinder you. The system is designed to be flexible enough to allow for improvisation.

Each race provides a +2 bonus to one of your **[ability scores](Abilities.md)**.
