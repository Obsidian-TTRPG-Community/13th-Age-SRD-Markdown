## Troglodyte

<u>For all troglodytes</u>

*Trog stench:* Trogs spray scents that stink so badly that other  
humanoids take penalties to all attacks, defenses, and saves when  
engaged with a troglodyte or when nearby three or more troglodytes.  
Non-humanoids arenâ€™t affected.

Humanoids affected by *trog stench* can make a normal save (with a  
penalty) at the end of each of their turns. If the save succeeds, the  
humanoid can ignore all *trog stench* for the rest of the battle.

*Trog stench* penalties vary for different humanoid races:

| Race                                                      | Save Penalty |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| Elves, gnolls, gnomes                                     | -4           |
| Humans, halflings, half-elves, holy ones, tieflings, etc. | -3           |
| Half-orcs, dragonics                                      | -2           |
| Dwarves                                                   | -1           |
| Forgeborn                                                 | 0            |
